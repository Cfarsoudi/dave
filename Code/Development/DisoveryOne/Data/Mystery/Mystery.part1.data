1   EXT.   NIGHT.   HOUSING PROJECTS -- MOSCOW                    1

    SMASH CUT

    MOTION -- flat out -- it's us -- we're running -- stumbling
    -- breathing rushed -- blood in the snow...

    We are JASON BOURNE and we're running down an alley...

    Supered below:   MOSCOW

    BLUE LIGHTS -- from the distance -- strobing through the
    night -- rushing toward us -- POLICE CARS -- three of them -
    - SIRENS HOWLING as they bear down -- closer -- faster --
    until they whip past the alley...

    Up against the wall -- BOURNE is hidden in the shadows.

    BOURNE is badly wounded -- shot through the shoulder --
    bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in
    SUPREMACY...

    With a GROAN, he lifts himself up, staggers across a park
    toward a PHARMACY...


4   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                4

    ROWS of MEDICINE and FIRST AID supplies, and in the
    background, a DOOR being jimmied...It's BOURNE...The ALARM
    goes off...

    MACRO ON -- MEDICINE BOTTLE

    VICODIN, as BOURNE grabs it...Then PENICILLIN...

    Then SURGICAL SUPPLIES:

    Scalpel...Forceps...Sutures...Cotton gauze...Betadine...

    BOURNE finds a large sink...Rests his gun there...Lays out
    SURGICAL SUPPLIES...Checks out his back in the
    mirror...Opens the capsules of penicillin and pours the
    powder directly into the wound...Begins treating himself...


5   EXT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                5

    A POLICE CAR pulls up to the curb, lights flashing. One
    POLICEMAN goes to the jimmied DOOR. SECOND POLICEMAN sees
    blood and footprints. He motions to his partner to
    follow...


6   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY BATHROOM -- MOSCOW                       6

    BOURNE finishing up -- splashes water on his face -- he
    seems a man on a mission. He looks up --

                                                                 2


       A MIRROR.

       His face...

                   Welcome to the program...

       POV Bourne walks down a corridor (corridor #1).


6AA    INT. NIGHT PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                  6AA

       The cops approaching.

                   You'll be saving American lives.

       A black sack is thrown over Bourne's head, then:

       (STOCK) A torrent of quick shots of Bourne's kills: the
       Professor, Jarda, the blonde guy in Paris, Mr. And Mrs.
       Neski...

       And finally. BANG -- Marie hit in the head.      The car off
       the bridge. She sinks away dead...


6A     INT.   NIGHT   PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                              6A

       The POLICE enter the back room, guns drawn.

                             POLICEMAN #1
                   Put your hands on your head and
                   turn around slowly!

       BOURNE snaps out of it, doesn't move. POLICEMAN #1 (older)
       approaches him. When BOURNE doesn't respond to his
       questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward. BOURNE turns and
       in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the
       POLICEMAN.

       BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN #2 with his gun and a look.

                             BOURNE
                        (in Russian)
                   Give me your gun and radio.

       POLICEMAN #2's gun and radio skittle across the floor.

                                                              3


                           BOURNE
                     (in Russian)
                 My argument is not with you.

     BOURNE smashes the radio and takes the gun.

     BOURNE exits...

     Establishing shot -- CIA Headquarters


8C   INT. CIA -- DAY                                              8C

     A workman installs a nameplate that reads:    Ezra Kramer,
     Director, CIA.


8C   INT. KRAMER'S OFFICE -- DAY                                  8C

     Kramer listens to a recording with Landy and Cronin. There
     are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he
     has just moved into this job.

                                                          4


Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          So we got in the way?   Is that
          why Neski died? Is that why you
          killed Marie?

Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          You killed Marie the minute you
          climbed into her car.   The
          minute you entered her life she
          was dead!

Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          I told you people to leave me
          alone! I fell off the grid. I
          was half way around the world.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          There's no place it won't catch
          up to you. It's how every story
          ends. It's what you are, Jason.
          A killer! You always will be.

THUMP!

                    CRONIN
          We think that's Bourne hitting
          him on the head and then--

He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun
to Abbott's head.

                       ABBOTT (V.O.)
          Go ahead!     Go on! Do it!

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          She wouldn't want me to. That's
          the only reason your alive.

The tape clicks off.

                    KRAMER
          Who's "she?"

CRONIN puts a picture of MARIE in front of KRAMER.

                    LANDY
          His girlfriend, Marie. She was
          killed in India three weeks ago.

Kramer looks down at another image.     Abbott dead after his
suicide.

                                                        5


                    KRAMER
          A dirty section chief in league
          with a corrupt Russian
          Billionaire commits suicide when
          confronted by Jason Bourne. You
          couldn't make this stuff up.
              (holds up the photo of
               Abbot dead)
          You watched this happen?

Landy nods.   Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole
situation.

                    KRAMER
          Bourne's last confirmed location
          is Moscow, three days ago?

                       LANDY
          Right.

                    KRAMER
          So what does he do now?

                    LANDY
          I think he's looking for
          something he hasn't found.

                       KRAMER
          Like what?     What's he after?

                     LANDY
          I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't
          gotten his memory back yet.  Not
          all of it.

A look from Kramer...

                    KRAMER
          Pam, what I need to know is, what
          kind of a threat is he to us?

                    LANDY
          If he just wanted to hurt us he
          could have sent this tape to CNN.

                    KRAMER
          Maybe he still will. Maybe he
          gave it to you because he wants
          to throw you in the opposite
          direction of his real plan. I
          don't know. I just know my
          number one rule is "the only way
          to stay safe is to assume the
          worst."   As far as I'm concerned
          Bourne is a serious threat until
          proven otherwise.

R15    INT.   DAY.    ITALIAN CAFE BACKROOM -- TURIN               R15

       ROSS interviews DANIELS, a TAPE RECORDER on the table
       between them. ROSS shows DANIELS some of the evidence he's
       assembled...WANTED POSTERS of JASON BOURNE.

                                ROSS
                         (with poster)
                     ...This one's three years ago --
                     had half of Interpol after him --
                     disappeared...Turned up in Naples
                     -- Berlin -- Moscow --
                     disappeared again...
                         (Daniels says nothing)
                     The girl he was on he run with --
                     Marie Kreutz -- she turned up
                     dead halfway around the world,
                     from a sniper's bullet...
                         (beat)
                     What connects the dots? Is it
                     Treadstone?

                               DANIELS
                     Turn off that tape recorder.

24     INT. DAY. MARTIN'S APARTMENT -- PARIS                       24

       The charm of old Paris captured in the workings of an
       elevator operating in a wrought-iron shaft...

                                                          7


A WORK TABLE, covered with sheet music, music paper,
pencils. And, sitting on the upright piano against the
wall, a framed PHOTO of MARIE...

A KNOCK on a door beautifully, heavily lacquered with
centuries of paint...

MARTIN KREUTZ, late 20s, opens the door and finds BOURNE. A
long look between them -- like two lost brothers who
recognize each other -- each has been waiting for this
moment for a long time.


INT. CONTINUOUS. MARTIN'S APARTMENT

Martin looks out the window.

                    MARTIN
          Where is my sister?

                    BOURNE
          She's dead. She was killed.

                    MARTIN
          I knew it was going to end this
          way. It was always going to end
          this way...

                    BOURNE
          I didn't believe that.

                    MARTIN
          Why did she die?

                    BOURNE
          She was shot. A man came for me.

                    MARTIN
          And then you killed him.

Bourne nods.

                      MARTIN
          Now what?

                    BOURNE
          Someone started all this...and
          I'm going to find them.

Bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves.


EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY

Bourne climbs the stairs.

Bourne rounds a corner and stops, sees a bodyguard at a
door up the street hail a car then go back inside.

                                                            8


     Bourne walks up to the door, the bodyguard comes out again.
     Bourne knocks him aside. Grabs the man behind him,
     ELLATRACHE.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Who started Treadstone?

     The bodyguard comes back, gun out--

                           ELLATRACHE
                    (in French, to
                      bodyguard)
                It's OK!
                    (in French, to Bourne)
                They're still looking for you.
                You are taking a big risk coming
                here.

     Bourne shoves him against the wall, hard.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Just tell me what I want to know!

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                I just provided them weapons.    I
                don't know who started--

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                You know something.   Tell me
                where to start looking.

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                There's a journalist in London.
                Simon Ross. He seems to know a
                lot about you.   He has a source
                inside the program. Someone
                there from the beginning. What
                should I tell them if they
                contact me?

                          BOURNE
                    (in English)
                They give me the name I want, or
                I burn their entire house down to
                get it.

                               ROSS
                    ...This is big -- a skein of lies
                    -- you pull at it and it just
                    keeps coming -- I'll fill you in

      As VOSEN steps out of the elevator and into his office, he
      is met by his #2, WILLS.

                               WILLS
                    We tracked the phone. Registered
                    to a London reporter named Simon
                    Ross. He works at the Guardian
                    newspaper.

                                                            10


      They enter a hallway through double doors towards the HUB.

                          VOSEN
                You tracking him?

      As they pass through, colleague hands WILLS a file.

                          WILLS
                Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a
                survey team covering him at
                work...and a sneak and peek's on
                their way to his apartment.

                          VOSEN
                Well, who talked to him? How did
                he find out about Blackbriar?

                          WILLS
                We don't know, we pulled his
                background and ran a cross check
                on any known anomalies, but we've
                come up with nothing. But, I
                think if we follow Ross, we are
                going to be able...

                         VOSEN
                Right. Ross is easy. I want the
                source.

      They enter the HUB.

                  I want rendition protocols and I
                  want the asset put on standby,
                  just in case.

      ROSS'S information come up on the center screen.

                  Our target is a British national,
                  Simon Ross, a reporter. I want
                  all his phones, his blackberry,
                  his apartment, his car, bank
                  accounts, credit cards, travel
                  patterns...I want to know what
                  he's going to think before he
                  does. Every dirty little secret
                  he has. And most of all, we want
                  the name and real time location
                  of his source.


                  This is NSA priority level 4, any
                  questions?

                  All right, let's get to it.

      BOURNE reads The Guardian. He sees an article written by
      Simon Ross.   Title: "RENEGADE ASSASSIN LOSE IN EUROPE".
      It mentions BOURNE. There is a photo of Marie--

      Marie smiles at him. Marie shot. Marie fades into the
      depths, dead. Bourne burns Marie's stuff


26D   INT. DAY. EUROSTAR                                           26D

      BOURNE comes out of the flashback.    He is still carrying
      the pain of her loss

      Bourne finds Ross's name on the masthead, then goes to the
      name just below it in the news department.

                           EDITOR

                           ROSS
                 Blackbriar.

      A REPORTER sticks her head in.

                           REPORTER
                 Sorry, a call for you.

                           REPORTER

                 Why aren't we hearing this?

                           WILLS
                 That's a hard line, Jimmy, why
                 don't we have it?

                            JIMMY
                 We have his line, sir, but he's
                 not on it.

                Sir, subject just arrived at the

      ROSS moves to the entrance.

      Behind him, inside the tube station portico, BOURNE
      arrives.

      Sees ROSS. Sees the two survey teams. MOBILE ONE up the
      stair well and MOBILE TWO at street level.

      Commuters coming up the escalators. BOURNE joins them -
      moving towards Ross.

      Closer.

      Right on him.   ROSS oblivious.   Looking out onto the
      street.

      BOURNE brushes past him and PUTS THE PHONE IN HIS POCKET..

      ROSS feels the contact. Checking himself -- he's okay.
      But now a phone is ringing -- looks around, must be someone
      else.

      But the vibration's coming from his jacket pocket.

      ROSS takes out the phone -- not his -- puzzled.

      ROSS hits "answer."

                                                            17

      BOURNE coming down. Three quick moves and he's down-
      slumped against a wall- just another drunk to step over in

                Why do you know so much about me?

                           ROSS
                What?

                          BOURNE
                The article. You talked to
                someone from Treadstone. Someone
                there at the beginning.  What's
                his name?

                          ROSS
                I can't tell you that.... Who's
                following me?

                          BOURNE
                Whoever they are it's trouble.

                          ROSS
                Are they Blackbriar?

                          BOURNE
                Blackbriar, what's Blackbriar?

                          ROSS
                I don't know. I heard the name
                this morning for the first time.
                Whatever it is, my source said it
                started with you.

                                                                22


                          BOURNE
                 What? What are you talking
                 about?

                           ROSS
                 Look, just help me get away from
                 these people...and we can talk
                 more...we can--

       ROSS moving fast. Fighting through the crowds of faces.
       Each one a killer in ROSS' tormented mind.

       BOURNE on the periphery looking out across the throng,
       picking out the inconsistencies.

      ROSS spinning round. Dipping left.   BLACK TOP passing in
      the background missing him.

      BOURNE crossing close behind - marshalling the pieces at

                  Straight ahead. News kiosk.

      ROSS turning.   Weaving through the commuters.

                  Change of plan. Stop. Tie your
                  shoelace.

      BOURNE seeing ROSS dip out of view as a group of TOURISTS
      block the CCTV's line of sight.

                  Clear. News kiosk. Straight
                  ahead.

      ROSS on the move. Sweating. Paranoid.

      Seeing a BIN MAN coming toward him -- reaching into his
      trolley.

                          ROSS
                Straight toward me.     Bin man?

                            BOURNE
                Negative.

                          ROSS
                He's got a gun.

                            BOURNE
                Negative.    Keep straight ahead.

      But ROSS swerves out of his path as the BIN MAN pulls out --
      a bunch of keys.

      CCTV CAMERAS turn -- ZOOMING IN ON ROSS.

       A wave of commuters flooding away -- sweeping the AGENTS
       back with them towards platform 7.

                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 GET IN THE STORE.

       BOURNE'S bought them thirty seconds.


100    INT. TUNNELS ABOVE THE CONCOURSE -- DAY                      100

       PAZ on the move. Earpiece crackling. Through a door. Taking
       a left down another tunnel.

       Opens another security door and moves up some steps.
       Towards a ladder.


100A   EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           100A

       The AGENTS regrouping. Speaking into their radios.

                           Voice
                 He's in the store -- still moving
                 east.

       ROSS out into the open again. In front of him another STORE
       COMPLEX.

                           BOURNE
                 INSIDE!

       BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him.
       The threat level clicking another notch.


102A/B INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           102A/B

       PAZ heads up some stairs to a service platform.

       Climbs a ladder.


101    EXT. CONCOURSE -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY                          101

       ROSS into the store complex. To one side is a service
       doorway.

       BOURNE sees the AGENTS approaching. Looks the other way --
       up at the hoardings above.

       Something's not right. Treadstone instinct.

                           BOURNE
                 Service doorway -- Now!

                                                                27


64H    INT. NEW YORK HUB -- SIMULTANEOUS -- DAY                      64H

       An image of Ross as he enters the store complex appears on
       the screen.

                            TECHY 2
                 Store.   Three means of egress.

                           VOSEN
                 Close him down...


105    INT. STORE COMPLEX -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY                   105

       ROSS through narrow store corridors. Sheer panic now.
       Two of the AGENTS move in after him.

       BOURNE behind them.

       BANG - takes the first out silently.

                           BOURNE
                 Keep moving.

       ROSS moving out to the light as another AGENT follows.

                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 Through the store room.

       ROSS travelling through.   The second AGENT right behind as-

       BOURNE steps out from behind the store room door. The dull
       snap of bones as second AGENT falls to the floor.


64H    INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                           64H

       On a screen VOSEN watches, transfixed, as BOURNE takes out
       all his agents and then grabs ROBB...

                           VOSEN
                 Jesus Christ, that's Jason
                 Bourne.

                           WILLS
                 Maybe he's the source?

                           VOSEN
                 It doesn't matter, the asset now
                 has 2 targets. Take them both
                 out.

       WILLS taps in the order...


102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- DAY                               102B

       PAZ moves cross a narrow walkway.

                                                                28


       Now he's behind a mechanical 'tri-panel' hoarding. The kind
       that displays a different advert every 15 seconds. He waits
       for the change and then---

       -- A huge field of vision across the concourse stretching
       out down below him- a sniper's heaven.

       PAZ pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes
       to work on it.

       Slowing the rotation. Rearranging the large triangular
       prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the
       trigger- and just enough cover to disappear.

       He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack. Starts to
       assemble them.


102C   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS (BEHIND THE SILVER METAL DOOR)        102C

                              BOURNE
                    I'm going to get you to safety
                    but you have to stay calm do
                    exactly what I say.

                              ROSS
                        (fear-induced autopilot)
                    Sure, okay.

                              BOURNE
                    No, listen to me: Exactly what I
                    say this time. Understand?

       Ross snaps to focus.     Looks Bourne in the eye.

                              ROSS
                    Yes.

                              BOURNE
                    Stay here while I look for an
                    escape.

       Ross nods.


102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                       102B

       PAZ puts together the rifle.


103    INT. WATERLOO STATION                                         103

       BOURNE exits from the silver door behind Threshers.    He
       stays on the phone with Ross.

       Hidden from the view of the CCTV cameras by the thick
       crowd, Bourne sees the approaching agents abruptly pulling
       back.

                                                                     29


                            ROSS (PHONE V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  I can see the entrance from here
                  I can make it out--

                            BOURNE
                  No, stay behind that door.


64H   INT. HUB                                                            64H

      CCTV view of the silver door behind Threshers that ROSS is
      behind (not Bourne). Wills is on phone.

                            WILLS
                  There. That silver door.
                  Bourne's behind that door?

                               TECH
                  Confirmed.

                            WILLS
                  Okay, pull the agents back and
                  give Bourne's location to the
                  asset.


107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107

      On his cell phone Paz receives a text indicating Bourne's
      location. Paz finds the silver door and aims his rifle at
      it.

      SCOPE POV

      A shape barely visible moving behind the window.           (It's
      Ross but Paz and the Hub think it's Bourne.


111   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS /         WATERLOO CONCOURSE-- DAY            111

      INTERCUTTING BETWEEN ROSS AND BOURNE:

      Bourne spots the agents pulling back per Wills' orders.

                            ROSS (INTO PHONE)
                  If I run now I can make it--

                             BOURNE (INTO PHONE
                  No.   Something's not right.


107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107

      Paz awaiting his shot--

                                                               30


       SCOPE POV

       The door comes open slightly, but from this angle Paz
       doesn't have a clean shot at his target (who he thinks is
       Bourne).


111    INT. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                                   111

       Bourne searches the rafters, looking for any threats from
       above.

                             ROSS (TEL. V.O.)
                   I'm going to go for it, okay?

                             BOURNE
                   Don't move until I tell you.

       Bourne is distracted by the last of the agents
       disappearing. Something is definitely wrong--

                             ROSS
                   I'm going to go for it.

                             BOURNE
                   No, No not now.

       Ross suddenly sprints out from behind the door--


110A   SCOPE POV                                                110A

       Paz sees the shape emerge--


110A   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA -- DAY                             110A

       PAZ fires--


111    INT. WATERLOO -- SERIES OF ANGLES                            111

       But it's Ross, not Bourne. Ross is hit by Paz's shot.    He
       falls, inches from the silver door, dead. Blood has
       splattered on the door.


110A   INT. PAZ'S NEST                                          110A

       Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot
       the wrong person. Then he catches a glimpse of Bourne--

       Bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of Paz's line
       of sight, and goes to the body.

                                                              31

       Vosen and Wills stare at the screen. At the image of Ross,
       dead on the concourse.   The room -- normally full of
       chatter has gone dead silent...

       Vosen puts his head in his hands. This is a monumental
       screw up and everyone here knows it.  He just had the
       wrong man killed....

                            VOSEN
                  Oh...shit...

       Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus:

                            VOSEN (CONT'D)
                  Get the asset out of there ...

                            WILLS
                  What about Bourne?

       On the HUB MONITORS we see Police moving in... Vosen
       doesn't need to see anymore.

                            VOSEN
                  Get him out of there - NOW!


111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

       Bourne feels Ross' body for something.

       Paz is frustrated by the order. He's itching to get another
       shot off at Bourne, but after a beat, packs up quickly, as
       ordered.


111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

111A   INT. DAY. WATERLOO STATION                               111A

       On the screens and in real life, the aftermath of the hit.
       PARAMEDICS try helplessly to deal with ROSS -- killed
       instantly by the head shot meant for BOURNE...POLICE arrive
       and seal off the crime scene...

                                                                32


113    EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY              113

       BOURNE on the move. Fast --

       Past platforms. On his way up to the Tri Panel.

       Up stairs. On to a walkway.   To his right he sees a figure
       disappearing...

       PAZ.

       BOURNE hammers down the walk - way in pursuit.


114    EXT. PLATFORM AREA -- DAY                                     114

       BOURNE tailing PAZ down on to a parallel platform. PAZ
       dipping down into the underground entrance.


115/116 INT. TUBE STATION -- WATERLOO -- DAY                 115/116

       PAZ moving deliberately through the evening rush hour--
       blending in...

       BOURNE in pursuit. Chasing on instinct.

       There...A glimpse of PAZ at the bottom of an escalator.

       BOURNE fights past people.

       PAZ disappears into the crowd.

       BOURNE rushes to catch him. Rounding a corner...

       A long walkway -- at the end, two staircases lead to
       different tube lines. BOURNE hesitates-- measures the
       choice.

       The sound of a train fills the station--

       BOURNE -- Fast downstairs.

       Watches-- just as PAZ gets onto the car at another door.

       BOURNE lunges to get on the train...But the doors close...

       BOURNE'S POV

       Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat,
       nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...He takes
       out the PILLS and dry-swallows them...Looks up...

       CLOSE ON -- BOURNE

       Watching PAZ...As if he's looking in the MIRROR at his old
       self...The self before THE BOURNE IDENTITY...

                                                                33


       CLOSE ON -- PAZ

       He looks straight ahead, just another commuter...

       BACK ON -- BOURNE

       Watching PAZ, as the train pulls away...Then BOURNE is
       immediately in motion...

       DANIELS watches news of ROSS murder on TV. DANIELS panics,
       opens his safe, packs up papers, takes Blackbriar FILE.
       Sets alarm. Leaves.


120C   EXT. NIGHT. INTERNET CAFE -- LONDON.                      120C

       BOURNE sits at a computer, the ROSS notebook open in front
       of him. He pages through it, finding names, places, "HOW
       DID THIS ALL START?" -- and Blackbriar.   He Googles
       "Sewell and Marbury"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid. BOURNE
       continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid.

       BOURNE leaves.

123A   INT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                   123A

       Vosen's sitting.

                             VOSEN
                       (to waiter)
                   Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy"
                   omelet with goat cheese and
                   peppers.

       Landy arrives.

                                                     34


                    VOSEN
          You're late. Traffic?

                    WAITER
              (handing her the menu)
          Ma'am?

                    LANDY
          Nothing for me.

Vosen looks at her, surprised.

                    VOSEN
          I'm buying.

She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat
off. She's not staying long.

                    VOSEN
          When the Director called, it was
          suggested we bring you on--

                     LANDY
          Suggested?
              (beat)
          Are you sure it was just a
          suggestion?

                    VOSEN
          Funny how different things look
          depending on where you sit. I
          look at this as doing a favor for
          you. Giving you an opportunity
          to complete some unfinished
          business.

                     LANDY
          Meaning?

                    VOSEN
          Jason Bourne.

                    LANDY
          Bourne's finished.

                     VOSEN
          Really?

                    LANDY
          It was finished the moment I
          realized I was chasing him for
          something he didn't do.   The
          case is closed.

                                              35


                     VOSEN
          So what do you make of this?
              (handing her
               surveillance photos of
               Bourne in Paris)
          French intel picked up Bourne
          meeting Pierre Elattrache on
          Tuesday. He threatened to burn
          our house down if you didn't tell
          him who started Treadstone.
          That's a big problem, wouldn't
          you agree?

                    LANDY
          This doesn't feel like Bourne to
          me.

                    VOSEN
          Why's it so hard for you to
          believe?

                     LANDY
          Probably because it's coming from
          you, Noah.

                    VOSEN
          Lets try and be adults okay? We
          all thought he was done, off the
          grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe
          he's a threat. We both want the
          same thing here.

                    LANDY
          So what happened at Waterloo?

                    VOSEN
          We have a leak. Bourne showed up
          in our surveillance. We had very
          little time to react.

                    LANDY
          And the reporter ended up dead?

                    VOSEN
          Bourne saw us coming.

Landy looks at him, suspicious.

                    LANDY
          So what was he doing?

                    VOSEN?
          We don't know. But just the fact
          that he was there means he's up
          to something, don't you think?
          Maybe he's the source?

                                                                  36


                               LANDY
                     The real question is how you
                     managed to get in a fire fight in
                     the middle of a public train
                     station.

                               VOSEN
                     Don't second guess an operation
                     from an armchair, Pam. It's not
                     fair.

                               LANDY
                     I'm going to the office now.
                     I'll make my own introductions.

       Off VOSEN...


125    EXT.   DAY.    ATOCHA TRAIN STATION -- MADRID                    125

       AN AVE train pulling into the vast station. BOURNE stepping
       out, walking up the platform.

       Moving out through the station...


125A   INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                          125A

       TWO NEW TECHS plus the three we met before.       All watching
       VOSEN lead LANDY and CRONIN into the room.

                               WILLS
                     This is Pamela Landy. She's
                     gonna be quarterbacking our
                     search effort. I think what we
                     oughta do, just to get started,
                     let's go around the room, say who
                     you are and what your spec is.

       LANDY stepping in before this gets going --

                               LANDY
                     Let's do names later.
                     (she's got the floor)
                     What's Bourne's last fixed
                     position?
                     (impatient)
                     Anybody.

                   You have an Echelon package?

                                TECH#1
                   Yes.

                             LANDY
                   Why isn't it on?

                             TECH#1
                   We were waiting.

                              LANDY
                   For what?
                       (no takers)
                   You're nine hours behind the
                   toughest target you've ever
                   tracked. I want everyone to sit
                   down, strap in, and turn on all
                   you've got.
                       (beat)
                   That would mean now.

       That lights it.    They're moving.

                                LANDY (CONT'D)
                   Thank you.

       VOSEN watches...

                             LANDY (CONT'D)
                   I want everything you've got on
                   Ross on screen one.

       LANDY watches as the screen lights up with ROSS
       information...


125B   EXT. DAY.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- MADRID                125B

       Bourne arrives, begins to recon the area.

       He goes to the front door finds "Sewell and Marbury" and
       rings the bell. No answer. Two cops come around a corner.

       Bourne sees them, notes the side of the building and
       leaves.

                                                       38


125E   INT. DAY.   CRI HUB -- NEW YORK CITY             125E

                              TECH#1
                   Sir, we just hacked Ross's email
                   account at the Guardian and found
                   a round trip ticket to Turin,
                   yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05
                   departure.

                             LANDY
                   I think we can be pretty certain
                   that Bourne's not your source
                   then?

                             VOSEN
                   How?

                             LANDY
                   Ross's call to his editor, where
                   he said he just met the source on
                   Blackbriar, took place just after
                   his flight landed. His met his
                   source in Turin.

                             VOSEN
                   So?

                             LANDY
                   So, what, Bourne met Ross for
                   breakfast and then, at noon the
                   same day Bourne calls Ross to
                   demand a meet at Waterloo?

                             CRONIN
                       (Needling Wills)
                   Maybe they were even on the same
                   flight?

                             VOSEN
                   Cross check the secure cell phone
                   usage of everyone with Blackbriar
                   SCI clearance against all calls
                   in and out of Turin during the
                   morning Ross was there

       TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards.

                             LANDY
                   The guy you're after is a CIA
                   operative with clearance above
                   Top Secret.   He was committing
                   treason by talking to Ross.   Do
                   you really think, while doing
                   that, he used a cell phone he
                   knows we can track?

                             TECH 3 (JIMMY)
                   Zero results on the cross check.

                                                       39


VOSEN stares daggers at her.

                    WILLS
          Do you have a better idea?

                    LANDY
          Yeah, I'd look at all the people
          whose cell phones were switched
          off the entire period Ross was in
          Turin.

                    WILLS
          Do it Jimmy.

TECHNICIANS start tapping.

                    LANDY
              (looks at Cronin)
          I mean if your people use their
          cell phones as much as mine do,
          the list should be pretty small

                    TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY
          Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack
          Boulin, Neal Daniels.

The names display on the screen:   Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin
Neal Daniels.

The HUB employees can't help but be impressed by LANDY.
WILLS and VOSEN notice their response.

                    LANDY
          Now check everything in Ross's
          apartment against those names.
          Look for common patterns, look
          for -

                    CRONIN
          Initials .....Bring that up on
          main.

LANDY turns.   CRONIN is leaning down in front of a
computer screen.   Point to something for the tech --- who
puts it on the big screen, blown up.

In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says "per
N.D."next to several scrawls.

                    LANDY
          Neal Daniels.   He's Station
          Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?

                    WILLS
          Jesus Christ.

                                                                40


                            VOSEN
                  Call the RSO at the Embassy and
                  have them take Daniels into
                  custody if he's there.   If he's
                  not, get a grab team to the
                  Calle Norte safe house. Send
                  them in heavy and tell them we'll
                  assist with entry.

                            LANDY
                  "Heavy?" Daniels isn't--

                            VOSEN
                  I'm worried about Bourne. If he's
                  not Ross's source, then he must
                  be after Ross's source -- just
                  like us.

       Off LANDY...


125F   EXT.   MADRID STREETS -- NIGHT                             125F

       BOURNE in a TAXI turning a corner into a narrow street.
       The rain has slowed, but the streets are still quiet.

       BOURNE gets out and walks past the SEWELL and MARBURY front
       door, picks the lock and gains entry.


126B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY. -- NIGHT                        126B

       BOURNE up the stairs.   Finds the office.    Jimmies the door.
       Disables the alarm.

       All the signs of a hurried exit. A half filled cup of
       coffee -- cigarette burned down in an ashtray but not
       snubbed out -- a light left on -- files and documents, some
       shredded, some not.

       Vosen paces back and forth. The hub is MUCH quieter than
       it was in the Waterloo scenes.

                            TECH 1. (LUCY)
                  Parque Vasquez is clean. No sign

FB3    EXT. HOSPITAL ANNEX -- OVERCAST DAY -- FLASHBACK            FB3

       Bourne arrives at a nondescript steel door with two CCTV

127B   INT. SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                         127B

       The flashback overwhelms Bourne.

FB3C   INT. TANK ROOM -- FLASHBACK                              FB3C

       Bourne is dragged into a room with a large water tank. His
       hands have been bound behind his back, the sack's
       drawstring pulled tight, and he has been weighted down.
       Bourne is shoved into the water.


FB3D   UNDERWATER SHOT -- FLASHBACK                             FB3D

       Bourne falls into the water. SPLASH. He starts to sink.
       The wet sack allows us to see the outlines of his face.
       Also POVs as Bourne sinks.

                                                                  42


FB3E   SERIES OF SHOTS FROM ABOVE AND BELOW WATER --FLASHBACK      FB3E

       Bourne struggles wildly at first. Tries to get out of his
       restraints. But to no avail. SRD men watch him from the
       edge of the tank. Perhaps also on monitors.
       Expressionless.


FB3F   UNDERWATER SHOT - FLASHBACK                                 FB3F

       Bourne fights every human instinct to draw a breath.    Also
       shot from Bourne's POV:

                           HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE)
                 You're going to drown. There is
                 nothing you can do to prevent
                 this. Stop struggling and accept
                 it.


       Finally Bourne can't hold his breath for an instant longer.
       His mouth opens. Water rushes in. He convulses, begins to
       drown...


FB3G   INT. TANK ROOM -- FLASHBACK                                 FB3G

       Bourne's body goes limp.   SRD men watch.   No reaction.

       BOURNE comes out of the FLASHBACK. As he staggers across
       the room, he notices a car arriving on the monitor...

       KILEY gestures to a light moving under a door.

       Kiley crouching...leaning in...hand on the knob, and --

       Pulls the closet DOOR OPEN --

       Nothing. Sink, dishes. a small kitchen.         And... on the
       stove...a tea kettle and a spoon...

       Which is the last thing they'll remember, because...

       BOURNE -- coming around the corner fast -- full stop and --

       BOURNE lays out HAMMOND... KILEY turns to find BOURNE --
       who takes him out too.

       Then it stops.

       BOURNE yanks the headsets.       Closes the PHONE.

136    INT. NIGHT.    MADRID SAFEHOUSE                             136

       ON A SECURITY MONITOR -- BOURNE sees another figure moving
       up the stairs...Checking his watch, reloading his gun.
       Twisting into the path to shoot as the door opens,
       hesitating because-

       It's NICKY.

       A beat -- long unbroken.

                              BOURNE
                    What are you doing here?

                              NICKY
                    I was posted here after Berlin.

                              BOURNE
                    Where's Daniels?

       The office PHONE goes. Bourne waving her to it.   She picks
       it up. He hits the speaker phone.


127H   INT. HUB                                                127H

                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    Hello.

                              VOSEN
                    Who is this?

                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    This is Nicky Parsons. Who's
                    this?

       Landy reacts to her voice...

       Both Vosen and Landy strongly suspect Bourne is there and
       listening...

       Vosen reads her "Duress Challenge" identity check off the
       screen. It reads:

       Challenge:    "Sparrow"

       Response if Under Duress:       "Ruby"

       Response if Normal:    "Everest"

                                                      46


                     VOSEN
          Nicky, I need to do an ID
          challenge first. Code in:
          "Sparrow."

Vosen looks at the screen to check her response...

                    NICKY
          Response: "Everest".

                    VOSEN
          Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How
          long have you been on site?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          I just walked in.

                    VOSEN
          We have two officers on site.
          Are you in contact with them?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          They're down. Unconscious, but
          alive.

                    VOSEN
          Is there any sign of Daniels?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          No.

                    LANDY
          Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We
          have reason to believe there is a
          connection between Neal Daniels
          and Jason Bourne.

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          Bourne, are you still looking for
          Bourne? I thought the case was
          closed.

                    LANDY
          No, some people are convinced
          he's still a threat. I disagree
          but to find out I need to talk to
          him.

VOSEN seething because LANDY has interrupted him...

                    VOSEN
          Hold on Nicky.

Vosen hits the mute button.

                    VOSEN
          What are you doing? You know
          Bourne's probably listening.

                                                              47


        Landy doesn't answer.    Vosen to Wills:

                             VOSEN
                   How long till back up arrives.

        Wills holds up three fingers.      Vosen unmutes.

                             VOSEN (CONT'D)
                       (into microphone again)
                   Listen, Nicky. I want you to
                   stay put and secure the premises.
                   It could be an hour until another
                   team arrives.

        LANDY piercing VOSEN with a look...

        BOURNE continues to hold the gun in her face -- NICKY is
        very calm considering the predicament she is in.

                               NICKY
                   Okay.

        DIAL TONE as the line gets closed at the other end.

                             NICKY
                   They know you're here.

                             BOURNE
                   How long do I have?

                   My car's outside.    I know where
                   Daniels is.

        BOURNE lowers his gun, grabs the phone and dials "1-1-2"

                                                             48

       BOURNE answers her in perfect Spanish with a perfect Madrid
       accent, but worked up, like a civilian would be...

                            BOURNE (SUBTITLE)
                  334 Calle Norte. I hear gunfire.
                  And men shouting. I think
                  they're Americans --

       BOURNE pushes the phone off the desk -- fires four shots
       into the ceiling -- calmly moves Nicky towards the back
       door...

                  just took out two more of my men.
                  Not to mention his ultimatum to
                  Ellatrache?

                            LANDY
                  The only way this has a happy
                  ending, Noah, is if we find a way
                  to bring Bourne in voluntarily.

                            VOSEN
                  He wants revenge, Pam. The only
                  realistic way to deal with this
                  is to eliminate the threat.

       BOURNE and NICKY rapidly descend.

                            BOURNE
                  Okay, where is Daniels headed?

                            NICKY
                  8 o'clock this morning, he wired
                  $100,000. to a numbered bank
                  account in Tangier.

                            BOURNE
                  Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles
                  away, we can make the morning
                  ferry.

                            NICKY
                  And then what?

                                                                   49

        Bourne and Nicky exit on to the street.     Suddenly they hear
        tires squealing nearby.

                             NICKY
                   They're coming.

        They continue to walk down the street towards Nicky's car.

        Vosen and Landy are watching this live.


        As they cross the street two MADRID POLICE CARS come around
        the corner the wrong way and screech to a stop.

        Vosen reacts...

        BOURNE and NICKY continue around a corner -- they get in
        her VW GOLF and drive away...

                 We lost Bourne.

                           KRAMER
                 You still think he's after
                 Daniels?

                           VOSEN
                 Yeah. Nicky's just the means.
                 But if we find Daniels, we'll
                 find Bourne.

                           KRAMER
                 Daniels knows way too much.
                 Daniels knows everything. We
                 can't let them meet.

                           VOSEN
                 I'll take care of it.

R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                            R145

       BOURNE and NICKY sit over coffee.    A long silence...then:

                           NICKY
                 What are you after, Jason?   Why
                 are you looking for Daniels?

                           BOURNE
                 Do you know who this is?

       Bourne puts the photo of Daniels and Hirsch on the table

                           NICKY
                 That's Daniels.
                     (points at Hirsch)
                 I don't know who that is.

                           BOURNE
                 I have to get back to the
                 beginning...or I'll never be free
                 of this.

                              NICKY
                 Who is he?

                                                                 51


                              BOURNE
                   I think he started Treadstone.    I
                   remember meeting him.   I
                   remember the first day...
                       (beat)
                   Daniels brought me to him.

       Nicky looks back at him....not sure what to say.

                             NICKY
                   What happened?

                             BOURNE
                   An initiation...I guess...


FB3B   FLASHBACK                                                     FB3B

       QUICK FLASH: Bourne, head in sack, is held underwater,
       struggling desperately for breath--


R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                               R145

       Bourne comes out of the flashback.      Nicky is looking at
       him....

                             NICKY
                   Jason...that wasn't some one-off
                   initiation. Daniels said they
                   did that to you over and over
                   again.   That's how they...

       She doesn't finish.    And Bourne doesn't ask her to.     Just
       a long pause.

                             BOURNE
                   Why are you helping me?

                             NICKY
                   It was difficult for me...with
                   you.

       BOURNE looks up.    Another long pause...

                             NICKY (CONT'D)
                   You really don't remember
                   anything?

                             BOURNE
                   No.

       NICKY'S face.

       Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe.

                             BOURNE (CONT'D)
                   We should move.

                                                            52

                    Noah Vosen.

       Then he puts his thumb into a print reader. The safe door
       pops open. He pulls out a file marked "Top Secret."

       CRONIN makes his way down the hallway.

       LANDY works at her desk.       CRONIN enters...

                              CRONIN
                    They tracked Daniels' passport to
                    a hotel in Tangier. They're
                    holding up a bank transfer he
                    made to keep him in place while
                    they move an asset in from
                    Casablanca.

       Off LANDY.    This just keeps getting worse...


145C   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE                                    145C

       Landy enters without knocking.

                              LANDY
                    Since when do you have
                    authorization for lethal action
                    against Daniels?

                              VOSEN
                    Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar
                    safe and fled to Morocco!

                              LANDY
                    So grab him--

                              VOSEN
                    I don't have the people on the
                    ground to do that and I'm not
                    going to risk that file falling
                    into the wrong hands.

                              LANDY
                    What's going on?    What's Daniels
                    got?

                                                            53


                          VOSEN
                What's he got? He ran all of
                Blackbriar's operations in
                Southern Europe and North Africa.

                          LANDY
                I think the world's well aware we
                have a rendition and lethal
                action capability at this point,
                Noah.

                          VOSEN
                For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got
                our entire playbook. Names,
                dates, ghost sites, how we train
                our assets.....

                          LANDY
                You still don't have the
                authority to kill him.

                          VOSEN
                Oh, yes I do, Pam.

      Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe.
      It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."

                           VOSEN
                That's what makes us special. No
                red tape. No more getting
                badguys in our sights and then
                watching them escape while we
                wait for some bureaucrat to issue
                the order.

      Landy opens up the file. Sees the words "instantaneous
      lethal action is authorized when..."

                          LANDY
                You just decide? No oversight.
                No checks and balances.

                           VOSEN
                Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw
                intel. You know how real the
                threat is.    We can't afford to
                have our hands tied like that
                anymore.

                            TECH
                  Sir, the asset is on the move, in
                  route to subject.


148H   INT. HUB - DAY                                               148H

                            TECH #1
                  Sir, the asset is back on course.

       VOSEN looks up.

                             WILLS
                  Sir, we have an unauthorized
                  breach. Someone with active
                  system knowledge has penetrated
                  out protocols. Information was
                  passed to the asset at 14.11.
                      (beat)
                  The trace is confirmed and valid.
                  It comes from a computer
                  belonging to Nicky Parsons.

       VOSEN looks over at Landy....his wheels turning.   A series
       of cuts between them.

                            VOSEN
                  Where did the course deviation
                  occur?

                            TECH (LUCY)
                  South to Rue Belgique.
                  Stationery at Place de France.

                            VOSEN
                  That's where Parson's is.

       He pauses, deciding what course to take.    Landy watches.

                                                     59


                    VOSEN
          When we're finished with Daniels
          send the asset after her. We
          find Parsons, we find Bourne.

                    LANDY (OVERLAPPING)
              (going to Vosen, firm)
          Noah, what are you doing?

                     VOSEN
          Not now.

                     LANDY
          Now.   I want to know what's going
          on.

                     VOSEN
          Not now.

                    LANDY
          I'm asking on what basis you're
          continuing this operation.

                    VOSEN
          On the basis that Nicky Parsons
          has compromised a covert
          operation. She is up to her neck
          in it.

                    LANDY
          This is about Daniels, not Nicky!

                    VOSEN
          She has betrayed us!

                    LANDY
          You don't know the circumstances!

                    VOSEN
          She's in league with Jason Bourne
          for Chrissake!

                    LANDY
          You don't have the authority to
          kill her or Bourne!

                    VOSEN
          Yes, I do Pam, it's right here
          and it's legal.

VOSEN slams a document on the desk.   INSERT SHOT:
"Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."

                    LANDY
          She's one of our own.   You start
          down this path...where does it
          end?!

                                                                  60


                               VOSEN
                     It ends when we've won.

       LANDY turns and storms out...

                               VOSEN
                     Notify the asset of the
                     additional target.

                                 BRYAN
                     Yes, sir.

       BRYAN codes in a kill order on NICKY...


164A   EXT. DAY. TANGIER                                              164A

       As he rides his VESPA, DESH receives additional target
       information..Pictures of BOURNE and NICKY.

       DESH glances in his rearview mirror -- spots BOURNE.


148H   INT.   DAY.    HUB -- MEDIUM CLOSE UP:                         148H

                               VOSEN
                     Have the bank release the funds.

       A TECH calls DANIELS.


167    INT. DAY. VELASQUEZ HOTEL                                       167

       DANIELS answers phone.

                     Mr. Daniels, Bank of Tangier.
                     Your funds are now available.

       Daniels leaves.


168    EXT. DAY.     TANGIER STREET                                    168

       DESH parks the motorbike and walks around the corner,
       BOURNE follows.

       DANIELS' car coming down the street.     BOURNE stops and sees
       the car -- realizes the danger.

       BOURNE turns back to see DESH with the detonator in his
       hand.

       BOURNE locks eyes with DESH.      Before BOURNE can react --
       DESH detonates.

       BOOM! DANIELS is DEAD.

                                                         61


BOURNE is thrown across the street by the blast.     He lays
MOTIONLESS.

DESH POV. He looks back to see BOURNE not moving, lying in
the street.

DESH gets on his motorbike and heads off to kill NICKY.


EXT.   PETIT SOCCO -- CONTINUOUS                               *

NICKY still at that café waiting. Taking out her phone-        *

his papers.                                                  *

BOURNE speaking in Spanish - fishing for his papers.         *
Looking back up the street. Forming a plan. Checking his     *

No time for this.                                            *

BOURNE breaks away. Through the crowds into the traffic.     *
Police whistles- shouting. Confusion.                        *

The chase is on.                                             *

Three policemen turning into his path. No choice. BOURNE     *
taking them down. Sprinting out across the road.             *

A KID and his moped. Caught up in the police dragnet.        *
BOURNE leaping on the bike - kick-starting it.               *

Away into traffic as two squad cars turn and make chase.     *

BOURNE weaving through traffic. One hand on the bike the     *
other on the cell, desperately trying to call NICKY.         *

But now, at least he's got a dial tone.                      *

           to -                                              *

DENIED'                                                      *

Really spooked now- looking around. Time to move.            *

Dismantling the phone instinctively - scattering it's        *
components.                                                  *

BOURNE picking up the pace. Three more police cars out of a   *
side road just missing him.                                   *

BOURNE choosing his exit.                                     *

Up ahead- a narrow alleyway - taking it.                      *

The squad cars crunching to a halt, behind him.               *

More police - on foot now.                                    *

BOURNE parking up. Seeing the crowded streets. Looking up     *
to the rooftops. He needs to get higher.                      *

Starts running up steps.                                      *


INT./EXT.   RIAD/ROOFTOPS -- CONTINUOUS                       *

BOURNE into a riad. Through a courtyard - up more stairs -    *
up a ladder. Out onto the rooftops. Scanning the skyline.     *
A beat. Has he misjudged?                                     *

No, there in the distance at the top of a narrow street-      *
NICKY walking slowly and behind DESH. Moving quickly.         *



BOURNE tailing him - trying to close the gap. Dipping down    *
through another riad - through an alley. Up more stairs.      *
Back up onto another roof. He's gained a few metres on        *
DESH.                                                         *

Desh goes up to the rooftops now. Bourne has him in sight -      *
DESH is prepping his gun with a silencer.                        *

DESH speeding up. BOURNE sees NICKY down below amongst the       *
crowds. In Desh's sights.                                        *

BOURNE knows he has to gain more ground.                         *

CABLE CAM shot - Two trained assassins leaping across the        *
narrow streets - silently effortlessly -- the cops down          *
below searching the alleyways, oblivious to the chase            *
unfolding above them.                                            *

BOURNE nearly on terms with him - then --                        *

DESH dipping down again into the street below.       Avoiding    *
the police -- he melts into the crowds.                          *

STEADYCAM SHOT - following BOURNE as he heads downstairs.        *
More stairs. Through a corridor then a courtyard -               *
bursting out of a door into the street -                         *

A police checkpoint. Right in his path.     Bourne forced to     *
dog leg and take another route.                                  *

BOURNE'S lost him- for the moment.                               *

why there are so many police around.                             *

Suddenly stopping - seeing DESH - knows instantly that he        *
is coming for her.                                               *

Now we see NICKY'S skills.    Has to think on her fee t-         *
TREADSTONE MINDSET --                                            *

Checking the alleyways.     Slipping out of sight.               *

NICKY looking to the rooftops -- taking the advantage.      Up   *
some steps -- into a riad.                                       *

Desh tracking her.                                               *

DESH arriving at the steps. Looks up to where Nicky is           *
going. Takes the entrance to the next building.                  *
Anticipates her next move. Aiming to cut her off.                *


EXT.   RIAD ROOFTOP                                              *

NICKY up steps.    Out onto the rooftops.   Looking for a path   *
across them.                                                     *

Scrabbling across the roof of this crumbling riad.    Knows      *
she can't go back down.                                          *

She makes it across to the next building.                        *

Where Desh is...                                                 *


EXT.   ANOTHER ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                             *

BOURNE up high.    Seeing NICKY on that other roof.              *

He can't get across to her.    Moving fast now.                  *

Down steps.   Into the riad courtyard.                           *


INT. RIAD                                                        *

BOURNE entering the hallway.                                     *

Moving up the stairs.   Towards Nicky.                           *

And towards Desh.                                                *

Meanwhile NICKY moving down. Looking out into the                *
courtyard below. The sound of POLICE getting nearer.             *

BOURNE hearing the POLICE too as he moves up onto a              *
landing.                                                         *

                                                                 *

BOURNE into a main room - something stirring on a couch - a      *
girl and her little sister having a siesta.                      *

In another room two small boys fast asleep.    TV playing.       *
One wakes.                                                       *

A noise on the stairs above. Quickly arranging a mirror -        *
getting line of sight - Bourne dipping into a corner.            *

It's NICKY.                                                      *

She gives him a look -- DESH is in here somewhere.               *

                                                         66


The door goes below them.   The noise of Police entering the   *
Riad.                                                          *

NICKY signalling to BOURNE - this way.                         *

They climb narrow stairs to the next floor.                    *

Down below Police begin searching rooms. Waking the            *
sleeping family. Shouting, crying. Commotion.                  *


INT./EXT. -- NARROW STAIRWELL                                  *

BOURNE and NICKY creeping up the steps.                        *

Then - suddenly NICKY spinning round as two silenced           *
bullets speed past her - And DESH bursting out of a landing    *
toilet.                                                        *

On to Bourne.                                                  *

Full on Treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell.           *

Crashing into a tiny disused lift cage- silent constrained-    *
vicious.                                                       *

Downstairs a young POLICEMAN hears the noise- heading for      *
the lift.                                                      *

NICKY seeing the handle turn. Thinking quickly.   She sends    *
the lift up to the next floor.                                 *

The POLICEMAN stepping back from the door -- directing the     *
other cops out to the courtyard.                               *

People are spilling out into the atrium.   It's pandemonium.   *


EXT.   ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                                   *

Bourne and Desh spill out of the elevator and onto the         *
roof.                                                          *

BOURNE kicking the gun - spinning across the floor - he and    *
DESH facing each other.                                        *

DESH with BOURNE - straight over the edge.                     *

DESH still on top - just.                                      *

A brutal exchange. Matching each other's moves like            *
shadows.                                                       *

Relentless. Rolling - falling onto another roof level.         *

And another.                                                   *

                                                                 67


       The two men tiring now. DESH grabbing for the bag.     The            *
       pills. BOURNE kicking them away.                                      *

       BOURNE has the upper hand now.      DESH'S reaction's slowing.        *
       No longer the match he was.                                           *

       BOURNE drags him to the ground.     He's finished.   Bourne's         *
       won.                                                                  *

       DESH- shivering -- convulsing.                                        *

       In the struggle, BOURNE strangles Desh.

194    BOURNE and NICKY hide DESH's body.                              194

                             BOURNE
                   Alright, we need to be dead.    You
                   need to code that in.

       NICKY CODES into DESH'S PDA -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED...In the CRI HUB the message comes up...VOSEN and
       LANDY believe NICKY and BOURNE are both DEAD...


196A   INT. DAY. HUB -- CRI -- NEW YORK                             196A

       The code from DESH remains on screen -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED -- like an EPITAPH for BOURNE and NICKY...VOSEN
       packs his briefcase. Turns to WILLS.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to be sure. Have the
                   station chief in Rabat confirm
                   the deaths and do a sub-rosa
                   check...And keep and eye on
                   Landy.

       Off WILLS...


197A   INT. DAY.   LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                            197A

       Cronin enters.

                             CRONIN
                   The hub just got word Bourne and
                   Nicky are dead.

       Landy looks at him.

                                LANDY
                   Confirmed?

                                CRONIN
                   Not yet.

       Landy looks away...thinking.      Wheels turning.

                                                                  68


                             LANDY
                   Get me a copy of Bourne's
                   personnel file.


195A    EXT. DUSK. PENSIONE                                        195A

        Bourne and Nicky enter.


198A    INT. DUSK PENSIONE -- WASHROOM -- TANGIER                  198A

        BOURNE scrubs the blood from his hands.    REVEAL Nicky
        watching him from the bedroom.


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy sits at her desk reviewing files on Treadstone. Open
        on her desk we see the file she will be looking at in the
        Supremacy phone call.

        The way she examines the papers we get the sense she thinks
        something is missing, some piece, some file.


198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A

        Bourne scrubbing the blood from his hands. Nicky comes in,
        touches his shoulder. There's a tenderness to it, a re-
        assurance. For a moment it looks like Bourne might
        react...but the moment passes....


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy opens a new file.   Bourne's operations.


198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A

        Bourne is toweling off.

                             BOURNE
                   I can see all their faces. But I
                   can't remember any names....


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy looks at Bourne's kills. The faces Bourne remembers.
        But there names are here, and who they were, why they were
        killed.


198AC   INT.   NIGHT.   PENSIONE -- BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM          198AC

        Bourne and Nicky sitting together.

                                                                  69


                            BOURNE
                  I was starting to remember who
                  they were...in India...with
                  Marie.

       A beat.

                             NICKY
                  It's just going to lead to more
                  killing, Jason. Are you sure you
                  want that?

       Bourne takes her words in.    But who he is is eating him
       alive from the inside...

                            BOURNE
                  I've killed people and I've tried
                  to apologize for what I've done,
                  for what I am. None of it makes
                  it better...

       Another moment passes between them...then:

                            BOURNE
                  They're going to come for you
                  again. You are going to have to
                  run now.

       She gets up.


198    INT. BATHROOM                                                   198

       Nicky dies her hair BLACK.    Starts cutting it shorter.


199    EXT.   NIGHT.   TANGIER BUS STATION                             199

       Bourne walks with a now dark-haired Nicky. They exchange
       looks for a long beat. She turns towards the bus.

                            BOURNE
                  It gets easier.


197    INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. NIGHT                                      197

       Landy finds a denotation in Bourne's file that he was
       "recruited to Treadstone by Neal Daniels."   Further down
       the   page it says "Bourne was inducted into Treadstone at
       the Special Research Department facility at 415 E 71st,
       New York, NY."    Then "Facility closed by order of
       Director, June 2002."

198C   INT. TANGIER MORGUE                                         198C

       Bourne looks at the tattered remains of Daniels' body and
       belongings.

                                                              70


        He goes through his briefcase and finds a nearly destroyed
        piece of paper with "Noah Vosen - Director of Operations -
        CRI" written on it. Bourne slips the morgue attendant a
        bribe.


198DA   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                198DA

        Vosen is shaving.

                            WILLS
                  Station chief in Rabat just
                  called, they found a body.
                  Bourne?

                               VOSEN
                  Desh.


198DB   INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY                                      198DB

        On final approach to JFK. Bourne looks out the window to
        see the Verizano Narrows bridge.   And beyond it,
        Manhattan.   Bourne is coming home.


A202    EXT. NEW YORK                                             A202

        Establishes skyline.


200     INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. DAY                                   200

                            CRONIN
                  Pam, You need to see this.

        Landy follows CRONIN into--


201     INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                201

        BOURNE'S PASSPORT is displayed on the computer monitor.

                            CRONIN (CONT'D)
                  This passport just cleared
                  Immigration at JFK ten minutes
                  ago. It's an early Treadstone
                  identity registered to Jason
                  Bourne but he never used it and
                  it never went to the grid.
                  Bourne's alive.

                            LANDY
                  They don't know.

                            CRONIN
                  No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't
                  be in his office right now.

                                                             71


202    INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL                                      202

       Bourne moves through the airport.

                           LANDY (O.S.)
                 It's a hell of a risk.

                           CRONIN (O.S.)
                 Yeah. Maybe Bourne wants us to
                 know, just like Naples, maybe
                 he's communicating.


201    INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE                                       201

                           CRONIN
                 Maybe he's trying to communicate
                 with you.

                           LANDY
                 Maybe we should communicate back.
                 Because I think I know what
                 Bourne's looking for.


202    SERIES OF SHOTS                                            202

       Bourne over the 59th Street Bridge -- arrives at CRI --
       goes into the adjacent building --


202A   INT. OFFICE BUILDING ACROSS FROM CRI -- DAY               202A

       Bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file Vosen is
       looking at -- he sees the word "Blackbriar." Vosen puts
       the file back in the safe.


203    INT. DAY. LANDY'S OFFICE -- CRI -- NEW YORK                203

204    INT. UNDEFINED SPACE                                       204

                           BOURNE
                 I hear you're still looking for
                 me.


203    INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                        203

       LANDY puts down her pencil.   CRONIN watches.

                                                            72


                             LANDY
                Bourne?


206   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE                                        206

      His phone rings.    He picks it up.

                          WILLS (TEL. V.O.)
                Get in here! Bourne called
                Landy!

      Vosen jumps up, sprints toward the hub--


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                                 203

                          LANDY
                I guess I owe you an apology.


207   INT. HUB -- BACK ROOM                                      207

      Vosen rushes in--

                          BOURNE (V.O.)
                Is that official?

                          VOSEN (OVERLAPPING)
                Are we triangulating?!

                           LANDY (V.O.)
                No. Off the record. You know
                how it is.

                             BACK ROOM TECH (OVERLAPPING)
                Trying--

                             BOURNE (V.O.)
                Good-bye.


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                        203

                             LANDY
                Wait.     Wait.

      She opens a file on her desk.


204   INT. UNDEFINED SPACE                                       204

      Bourne listening--

                          LANDY
                David Webb. That's your real
                name.

207   INT. HUB -- BACK ROOM                              207

                           VOSEN
                 Why the hell did she give him
                 that?

                           LANDY (V.O.)
                 You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa,
                 Missouri.


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                203

                            LANDY
                 Why don't you come in, and we'll
                 talk about it?
                     (beat)
                 Bourne?


204   INT. UNDEFINED SPACE                               204

                           BOURNE
                 Get some rest, Pam.


207   INT. HUB -- BACK ROOM                              207

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 You look tired.

      Vosen realizes--

                           VOSEN
                     (rushing out)
                 He's got line of sight on us!


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                203

       Landy takes out her gun.   Checks it.

       HIGH ANGLE:   Landy leaves CRI.


207    INT. HUB -- DAY                                             207

       Wills walks over to Vosen. The look in his eye indicates
       that he thinks there's something odd about this:

                            WILLS
                  Landy just left the building.

       Vosen looks at Wills.... A beat, Vosen's suspicion
       building, though he can't quite put his finger on what he
       suspects...

                            VOSEN
                  Check Landy's phone.   Is she
                  using it?


217B   EXT. NYC STREETS -- DAY                                 217B

       Landy receives a text message.

       Vosen leans in to the Hub's back monitoring room.

                             VOSEN
                  Nothing?   No calls since Bourne--
                  ?

                            BACK ROOM TECH
                  Wait a minute. Wait. She just
                  got a text.

                                                                 75

                     What the hell do you mean we

                     you can't read it--
                         (to Wills)
                     Are we on Landy?

                     I want that goddamn text.   We
                     need to get out in front of her!

                     Seconds...

       VOSEN paces anxiously.

                     Got it!

       TECH points at big screen: "Tudor City Pl & 42nd.   Ten
       minutes. Come alone. Come on foot."

                               VOSEN
                     Surround it. Anyone not on Landy
                     goes to Tudor City. Now!

       LANDY walks east toward Tudor City.   She looks around her
       for any signs of surveillance but finds nothing out of the
       ordinary.

       Vosen and AGENTS come running out of the front door.
       Others leave through a side entrance.   They jump in
       sedans.

       Vosen and agents race to Tudor city.   An electronic map on
       the dash.

                           AGENT 3
                 Copy, we're going to take a left
                 at 41st. One block, settle at
                 the corner.

                           VOSEN
                 Get the map up.

                           AGENT 4
                 It's a bad place to pick, it's
                 too exposed.

                           VOSEN
                 He wouldn't have chosen it if he
                 didn't have a reason.

       An agents trails her on foot.   Another parallels her from

       SERIES OF SHOTS: CRI cars arrive, careful to stay several
       blocks from the meet site. They jump out and try to set up
       surreptitious surveillance posts.

                 Okay folks here we go, box at two

       We can't tell where we are or what he's doing.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 This is Jason Bourne.

       VOSEN reels for a beat. Then quickly scans the streets,
       trying to see if he can spot BOURNE.

                           VOSEN
                 How did you get this number?

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 You didn't actually think I was
                 coming to Tudor City, did you?

                           VOSEN
                 No, I guess not. But if it's me
                 you want to talk to maybe we can
                 arrange a meet.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 Where are you right now?

                           VOSEN

                               BOURNE (V.O.)
                     I doubt that. If you were in
                     your office--


233    INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                       233

       REVEAL that BOURNE is inside VOSEN'S office.

                               BOURNE
                     We'd be having this conversation
                     face-to-face.

       BOURNE hangs up. Puts a portable dictaphone up to VOSEN'S

       From the safe, BOURNE scoops out the "TREADSTONE:
       Blackbriar" folder Bourne saw Vosen putting into his safe."

       He flips it open. He scans down the page.         His eye
       stopping at the words "US Citizen."

       He flips to another page -- another photo, and again "US
       Citizen."

       BOURNE shoves the folders in his backpack and leaves.

       CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP...

       BOURNE walks around a corner near CRI. He hears a siren
       turn on a few blocks away. Then another.   He starts to
       run.


240    INT. CRONIN'S CAR -- DAY                                   240

       A SEDAN pulls to a stop as a door comes open. CRONIN'S

240B    INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                          240B

        The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points--

        BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger-
        side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car
        makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire
        accurately.


240C    EXT. 41 STREET -- DAY                                        240C

        The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the
        sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He's already past them.
        The passenger side agent jumps out. But he's still got to
        get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead
        over the hood of his car on Bourne.

        The other CRI car races the wrong way on the street but
        gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel
        traffic.

        Bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto 40th
        street.   He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete
        ramps leading into and out of Port Authority.

                                                             82


       He runs across 10th Avenue as a third CRI car screams up
       the street at him.

       jams the accelerator down.   He'll be on top of Bourne --

260    EXT. PORT AUTHORITY -- DAY                                  260

       A New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around
       the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees
       Bourne and the CRI car giving chase heading right at the
       bus.

       Bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete
       guard rail.   The driver calls it in--


261    SERIES OF SHOTS                                             261

       Cops and CRI cars close in on Port Authority.   One agent
       jumps out of his car on 8th Avenue and rushes for the
       stairs.

                                                               83

262   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                    262

      Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot.
      He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly
      (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete
      railing at the east end of the roof.

      Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars. Smashes the
      window of one to set off its alarm.   Then a second and a
      third, setting off their alarms.

      The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an
      alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in.

      Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks
      handful of wires off the steering column and starts to
      expertly hotwire the car.

      Agents race up stairwells.   Two CRI cars careen up the
      ramp to the passenger parking (a separate ramp to the bus
      ramp we saw Bourne on earlier.) A third CRI car races
      through the parking level just below the roof and up the
      circular ramp to the roof.

      EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY

      Bourne works to hotwire the car.

      A CRI car gets to the roof.   Two agents come from the
      elevator lobby.   The three car alarms distract them. They
      search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...

      Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of
      modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
      locked.

                                                                84


      A second CRI car arrives.

      Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
      speed.

      He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a
      sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly
      free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
      stops.

      Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.   A
      third blocks the exit ramp.

      Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
      from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower
      of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
      metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead
      on him.

      Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm
      toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?


267   INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                        267

                We've got him! He's got nowhere
                to run!

                Take him out!


268   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                     268

      The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
      toward Bourne--

      But before they can get a bead--

      Bourne slams the car into reverse again.   Petal to the
      metal in reverse--

      The agents open fire.

      Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
      But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.

      As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent
      adjusts his fire into the car's grill.

      Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
      backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's
      driveline.

      Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
      behind him.

                                                            85


      Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
      gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
      structure.

      Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits
      the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
      car up and over the wall.

      Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a
      second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden
      angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's
      car, to the shooters.

      Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
      Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25
      feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.

      The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
      against the roof.

      Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a
      moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over-
      turned car.

                           CRI AGENT
                 Ho-ly shit!

270   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                  270

      The CRI agents race to the spot where Bourne's car
      disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into
      Bourne's car but they're too late! Bourne's already out.
      He disappears from sight under the covered parking
      structure.

        Clearly there is no one down there. Bourne's car jump from

274A    INT/EXT. CIRCULAR RAMP                                    274A

        Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the
        level Bourne's on.


275     INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP        275

        Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
        pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
        roof lands hard behind him.

        Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
        slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
        a head on charge.

        The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
        instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
        shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
        the floor as he dives out of the car.

        The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
        Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
        glass shatters, and airbags explode.

        Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
        car implodes against the oncoming agents.

                                                       87


Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.

The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.

The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.

The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.

An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.

With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.

Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.

The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.

The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.

                   BOURNE
          10-13. Shots fired. Officer
          down. Port Authority parking
          lot. Level four.

Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer.   Then he hands the cop his
radio back.

                    BOURNE (CONT'D)
          Stay out of sight until one of
          your own arrive.

Bourne disappears.

We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits.

CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--

                                                               88

277    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 277

       Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east,
       followed closely by a CRI sedan.

       As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into
       Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the
       right. It ricochets off several parked cars before
       regaining control.

281    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 281

       Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
       the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
       by hitting his bumper.

       Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
       The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that
       car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
       CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
       and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.


282    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                     282

       Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that
       indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US
       95." Bourne turns right--

       Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
       shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
       top of Bourne's leg.

       REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As
       Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
       intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
       it into the side of Bourne's car.

       Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging
       forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his
       front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
       car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's
       car by sliding into his path.


283    OMITTED                                                      283

284    EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY                                  284

       Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
       the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
       slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.

       Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
       to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.

       Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
       intersection completely blocking his path.

       Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
       on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.

       As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
       and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
       other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.

       Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
       right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan
       overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.


284A   OMITTED                                                    284A


287    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                      287

       On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
       (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
       ahead.

       Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:

       The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
       through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
       Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
       the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.

       Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
       SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
       oncoming traffic.

       Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
       sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
       street ahead.

       The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
       rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
       it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
       Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked
       cars.

       Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the
       road.

       SMOKE and STEAM -- SIRENS -- CHAOS

       THE CAMERA FINDS

       DR. HIRSCH, 70, is, put simply, not a man to be trifled
       with. He's a 45 year CIA veteran. One of the great brains
       in the Agency's history, but also a man who knows how to
       wield power silently, invisibly, and to tremendous effect.

       There's a wistfulness in the way he says it. But also the

                   4/15/71 isn't much of a code. My
                   guess is Vosen's already on his

                   David... Come in with me. It's

323    INT. LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                                  323

       Landy runs across the lobby.


323    EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- LATE AFTERNOON                           323

       Vosen's SUV careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic.
       Still a half block from the entry door but it's close
       enough--


322    INT. CORRRIDOR                                                322

       Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor--


325    INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                         325

       Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby.

                                                                   96


                             VOSEN
                       (to a group of six
                        agents)
                   I'll find Landy. You get to the
                   training wing and get Bourne!

       A security guard comes over.

                             VOSEN
                   Do you know who I am?
                       (the guard nods)
                   Where's your security room?


324    INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR                                           324

       Landy looks around. Finds an open office. She pushes open
       the door and runs to the fax machine. She starts faxing
       the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe.


324A   INT. SECURITY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                         324A

       Vosen enters.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to see all your footage
                   for the last three minutes.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the
       corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback.

       We see Bourne go into--


FBA3   FLASHBACK                                                    FBA3

       That first day, Bourne's POV being led down this corridor
       by Daniels.


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                    322

       Bourne moves down the corridor.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne reaches the end of the hall.       He looks around
       "flashback style" --

                                                                97


FBB3   FLASHBACK                                                 FBB3

       Bourne was standing at this door....


331    INT. OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON                                 331

       Vosen enters the room.    The last pages have been faxed...

                             LANDY
                   You better get a good lawyer.

       She exits...


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                 322

       Then spins, gun up--

       Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him.

                             HIRSCH
                   Put the gun down. I wouldn't be
                   here if I didn't want to talk.

                              BOURNE
                   I've spent three years running.
                   Three years trying to find out
                   who I was.

       Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.

                             HIRSCH
                   You still don't have it all back,
                   do you? You haven't filled in
                   all the pieces?

                             BOURNE
                   Let's start with the moment you
                   found out I wouldn't execute
                   Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the
                   issue, it was the fact that I
                   didn't pull the trigger....

                             HIRSCH
                   One lapse meant your conditioning
                   had failed.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall

                             BOURNE
                   It was always you, behind
                   Conklin, behind Abbott.... They
                   were just following orders.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.   Searches
       him for weapons.

                                                             98


                             HIRSCH
                       (completely calm)
                   I'm unarmed, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                       (shoving Hirsch hard
                        against the wall)
                   "David." I'm David Webb.

       CLOSE ON Bourne's face--

                             HIRSCH
                   You were David Webb, but not
                   anymore.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING CORRIDOR -- LATE AFERNOON           322

       Bourne stands with Hirsch.

                              BOURNE
                   Why me?   Why did you pick me?

       A beat...

                               HIRSCH
                   You really don't remember, do
                   you?
                        (beat)
                   You picked us, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                   What does that mean?

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered.

       Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall.
       The "room in use" sign lights up.

       Bourne looks up "flashback style"--


FBA1   FLASHBACK                                                  FBA1

       Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from
       the first day...


322    INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                    322

       Bourne and Hirsch enter...

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered right here....
                   You didn't even blink, Jason.
                   You just handed me these...

                                                             99


       Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket.
       Holds them out to Bourne.

       Bourne takes the dog tags.        Stares at them.

       INSERT of the dog tags:

       Webb, David

FB9    FLASHBACK                                                   FB9

       Bourne hands over his dog tags....


                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Has everything been explained to
                    you.

                                BOURNE
                    Yes, sir.

322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              HIRSCH
                    You were a soldier ready to serve
                    his country. Just like thousands
                    of others, except you were a
                    prodigy with languages...and a
                    perfect shot.

FBB3   FLASHBACK                                               FBB3

                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Your missions will save American
                    lives.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              BOURNE
                    You said I'd be saving American
                    lives. Instead you just turned me
                    into a killer.

       Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch.

                              HIRSCH
                    You could have left at any time.
                    And you knew exactly what it
                    meant for you if you chose to
                    stay.

                                                               100

                              HIRSCH
                    When we're finished with you,
                    you'll no longer be David Webb.

                              BOURNE
                    I'll be whoever you need me to
                    be, sir.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                   322

                              HIRSCH
                    Stop running from the truth,
                    Jason. You chose to come here!
                    You chose to stay! And no matter
                    how much you want to forget
                    it...eventually you're going to
                    have to face how you chose, right
                    there, to become Jason Bourne!



FB10   FLASHBACK:                                                 FB10

       Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.     Hirsch looks
       at him from behind the desk...

                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    You haven't slept for a long time
                    have you David? Have you made a
                    decision? This can't go on, you
                    know. You have to decide.

                                 BOURNE
                    Who is he?

                              HIRSCH
                    We've been through that.

                              BOURNE
                    What did he do?

                               HIRSCH
                    It doesn't matter.
                        (beat)
                    You came to us. You volunteered.
                    You said you'd do anything it
                    takes to save American lives.
                    You're not a liar are you? Or too
                    weak to see this through? This is
                    it. Let go of David Webb. Will
                    you give yourself to this
                    program?

                                                             101


      Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand. He gets to his feet
      swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded
      figure. The man slumps over.

      Bourne stares at what he's done.

                          HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                You're no longer David Webb.
                From now on you'll be known as
                Jason Bourne. Welcome to the
                program.

      Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is
      dead.

      Just then Kramer walks through the door.

                          KRAMER
                He's ready. Send him to
                Operations.


322   PRESENT                                                      322

      And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback.
      He stares back at Hirsch....

                          HIRSCH
                Do you remember now?

      Bourne lowers the gun.

                          BOURNE
                I remember. I remember
                everything.

                          HIRSCH
                You can't outrun what you did,
                Jason. You made yourself into
                who you are.

                          BOURNE
                I'm done running.  That's why
                I'm here. To end you, to shut
                this down. I'm no longer Jason
                Bourne.

                          HIRSCH
                So now you're going to kill me?

                          BOURNE
                No. You don't deserve the star
                they give you on the wall at
                Langley.

      Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.    It's
      locked.

                                                            102


322   INT. HALLWAY                                                322

      The agents fire at the door handle to get it open.


322   INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                     322

      Bourne looks out a window.   Sees the layout of a roof
      several stories below. Then he turns and shoots out the
      room's mirrored observation window. Bourne dives through
      it just as agents rush in and open fire at him.


      SERIES OF SHOTS

      Bourne races through corridors, loosing the CRI agents.


352   EXT. ROOF -- NIGHT                                          352

      Bourne runs out onto the roof. Rushes across it to look
      over the edge.   It's a straight drop to the FDR -- 12
      stories down.

      He races to another ledge -- the East River below him. But
      he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of
      the building to hit the water.   He backs up to get a
      running leap.

      As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on
      him.

                             PAZ
                   Why didn't you take the shot?

      Bourne looks at him.

                             BOURNE
                   Do you even know why you're
                   trying to kill me? Look at what
                   they make you give.

      Bourne turns and runs off the roof.

      Paz fires into the air...

      FOLLOW Bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the
      freezing river--

      MULTIPLE ANGLES -- Bourne goes into the river...


352   UNDERWATER                                                  352

      Bourne in a dead man's float...as his clothes soak through
      he begins to sink....

                                                            103


      PULL BACK...farther and farther from Bourne's dead still
      sinking....as OVERLAPPING, INTERWEAVING VOICE OVERS begin:

                   Assassination program code-named
                   "Blackbriar" was exposed by a
                   former assassin named David Webb--
                   -

                             ANCHOR 3 (V.O.)
                   Program reportedly targeting US
                   Citizens in some cases...

                             ANCHOR 4 (V.O.)
                   CIA Director Ezra Kramer produced
                   explosive documents for the
                   Senate Committee indicating
                   "Blackbriar" was authorized at
                   the highest levels of government.


356   INT. BAR -- URUGUAY -- SUNSET                               356

      Nicky goes to the bar of at a low end tourist bar with
      several other customers.   She stands there, eyes fixed on
      a TV behind the bar:

                             ANCHOR 5 (V.O., CONT'D)
                   Webb, who was known inside the
                   intelligence community, as "Jason
                   Bourne" jumped from the
                   fourteenth floor of the CIA
                   facility where he was trained in
                   New York into the East River
                   below.   While experts say it
                   would be nearly impossible to
                   survive the fall, despite two
                   weeks of efforts, his body has
                   still not been recovered.

      PUSH in on the smile that develops on Nicky's face.   As we
      CUE the Moby "Extreme Ways" sting---

      Bourne's body sinking toward the bottom...when all of a
      sudden it comes to life -- arms together, legs kick
      powerfully--

      And Bourne swims away...

                                                     Sep 30th, 2006                         

                         

          OVER A BLACI: SCREEN:
          Crickets chirp in the night.
          A DOORBELL rings.
          Sheets rustle...
          A BEDSIDE LAMP is turned on.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          NORMA LEWIS ( 31) sits up in bed. The soft glow of the lamp
           casts her in silhouette. Her husband, ARTHUR LEWIS (30), lies
          next to her.

                          NORMA
          Did you hear something?

                         ARTHUR
          The doorbell.

                         NORMA
          Are you sure that was the doorbell?
          From down below... the DOORBELL rings again.

                         ARTHUR
          Yep.
          Norma retrieves her WATCH from the bedside table.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          What time is it?

                         NORMA
          Quarter 'til five.
          Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe.
          Arthur sits up, hair sticking up in every direction. He has
          sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          Norma comes down the stairs and approaches the front door.
          She looks through the PEEPHOLE.
          Through the PEEPHOLE... she glimpses a BLACK SEDAN idling in
          the street. It quickly drives off.
          Norma unlatches the DEAD BOLT and opens the door. She notices
          something at her feet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Someone has left a CARDBOARD BOX on the front step. It's
          dimensions are 1' x 1' x 1'
          She leans down and picks up the box, noticing that it has
          been meticulously sealed with clear tape. There are no
          markings on it whatsoever.
          Norma looks down the quiet, empty street. She quickly closes
          the door and turns inside and away from the cold air.
          Arthur arrives at the bottom of the stairs.

                         ARTHUR
          What is it?

                         NORMA
          Someone left a box.

                         ARTHUR
          Who?

                         NORMA
          I don't know. There was a car
          waiting... but they drove off.
          Norma hands the box to Arthur. He examines it.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Is that one of my Christmas
          presents?
          Their young son, WALTER LEWIS ( 9), is standing at the top of
          the stairs. He is dressed in his pajamas.
          His parents just stare back at him in silence.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

          The Lewis family has now moved into the kitchen. WRAPPING
          PAPER and CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS are scattered across the table.
          Norma is pouring COFFEE. Arthur is cutting through the tape
          that seals the box with a knife while Walter looks on
          eagerly.

                         WALTER
          Should I close my eyes?

                         ARTHUR
          Maybe... it's up to you.
          Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS
          inside. He digs down and retrieves a WOODEN BOX. Its
          dimensions are 8" x 8" x 8".

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          The box is made of WHITE OAK with a clear varnish. Mounted on
          top is a CLEAR GLASS DOME attached to a lid with a HINGE
          MOUNT. Inside of the dome is a CYLINDRICAL METAL BUTTON.

                         NORMA
          Is there a note?
          Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE
          ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name:

          MRS. LEWIS

                         ARTHUR
          It's for you, Norma.
          Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white
          stationary.
          Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence:

          MR. STEWARD WILL CALL UPON YOU AT 5:00 PM.

                         NORMA
          Mr. Steward will call upon you at 5

          PM.

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Do I know a Mr. Steward?
          Arthur yawns.

                         ARTHUR
          I dunno. You tell us.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- LATER THAT MORNING

          Arthur is now showered and shaven, dressed for work. He and
          Walter sit at the kitchen table, waiting for Norma to deliver
          breakfast.
          The box sits on the table between them.
          Arthur opens up the newspaper.

                         INSERT SHOTS:

          RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH... FRIDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1976.

                         BANNER HEADLINE:

          OPEC SAID TO DECIDE ON SPLIT HIKE
          Arthur turns the page.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         ARTHUR
          What kind of car was it?

                         NORMA
          I couldn't see. It was dark and 1
          didn't have my contacts in.

                         WALTER
          Why would they just drive off?

                         NORMA
          I don't know. But the bus will be
          here if five minutes... so eat.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma and Walter emerge from the house onto the front porch.
          She hands him his LUNCH BOX and a WINTER HAT. SNOW has begun
          to fall from the sky.

                         WALTER
          Last day of school and now it
          starts to snow?!

                         NORMA
          Put on your hat...
          A young girl, DANA ( 13) is waiting at the end of the
           sidewalk. She is wrapped head-to-toe in warm clothes...
          EARMUFFS and SCARF around her neck.

                         DANA
          (muffled through scarf)
          Hi Mrs. Lewis.

                         NORMA
          Good morning, Dana.

                         (SHIVERING)
          And please call me Norma. You're
          making me feel old.

                         WALTER
          You are old!

                         NORMA
          I'm thirty-one!

                         WALTER
          To us that's old! You're a geezer!

                         NORMA
          Well you'll be a geezer one day
          too, smarty-pants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          Norma closes her eyes, taking in a breath of cold air.
          Snowflakes land in her face and hair.
          Walter sighs... looking at his watch.

                         WALTER
          Why does the bus stop have to be at
          the end of our driveway?

                         NORMA

                         (HIGH-PITCHED)
          So I can watch my little Walter get
          on his bus... safe in one piece!
          Down the street, A SCHOOL BUS begins to crest the hill...
          fast approaching...

                         WALTER
          Please. Go. Inside. You're
          embarrassing me.

                         NORMA
          My love embarrasses you?

                         WALTER
          Yes. Yes it does.
          She begins to walk down the sidewalk... taunting him as the
          bus approaches.

                         NORMA
          What if I give little Walter a
          little kiss in front of all his
          friends on the school bus?
          Dana's eyes widen. A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN emerges from behind the
          scarf that covers the lower part of her face.

                         DANA
          Do it!
          The bus is fast approaching... brakes squealing as it slows
          to a stop.

                         WALTER
          Don't come any closer!
          Norma gives him a big HUG and a KISS right as the bus doors
          open. A bunch of OLDER KIDS stare out the window... scowling
          at him.
          Walter pushes away from her and stomps up onto the bus...
          mortified. Dana follows him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         NORMA
          Dana... you're baby-sitting for us
          tonight, right?

                         DANA
          Eight o'clock?

                         NORMA
          Eight o'clock.

                         DANA
          Okay.
          Dana gets on the bus. BUD WALL (30s), the bus driver, smiles
          at Norma. He is an enormous giant of a man with a shaved
          head.

                         NORMA
          Bus-Driver Bud! Merry Christmas...

                         BUD
          Our last day!

                         NORMAL
          I know!

                         BUD
          It'll all be over soon, Norma.
          He stares at her for a moment that is almost too long... then
          shuts the doors to the bus.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur sits at the table... reading the morning paper.
          The CAMERA zooms into the COMICS SECTION... revealing the
          panels of the comic strip REX MORGAN, MD. Arthur begins
          reading the voices of REX MORGAN and his girlfriend JUNE.

                         ARTHUR
          (as Rex Morgan)
          Do you realize that this is the
          first time in my life that I will
          be taking more than a week's
          vacation, June?
          Norma arrives in the kitchen. She now has a slight limp.

                         ARTHUR (CONT-D)
          (as June, hi-pitched)
          And enjoy it! Don't worry about the
          office!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          .4

          7.

                         NORMA
          Rex Morgan... I need you back here
          no later than seven. Rehearsal
          dinner starts at eight.
          Arthur grabs his BRIEFCASE and a BASKETBALL.

                         ARTHUR
          The Viking Squad has a game at
          four.

                         NORMA
          Don't get stuck in Friday
          traffic...

                         ARTHUR
          Okay June.
          He starts bouncing the ball on the kitchen floor.
          She grabs the ball in mid bounce... annoyed with him.

                         NORMA
          Not in the house!

                         ARTHUR
          How's your foot?

                         NORMA
          It's fine.
          She pushes him toward into the FAMILY ROOM... opening the
          door that leads out to the garage.
          They exit the house and the CAMERA drifts back toward the
          kitchen table... moving in toward the box.

           EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           The GARAGE DOOR opens and both of the LEWIS FAMILY CARS back
           out at the same time, almost choreographed in perfect unison.
           Arthur drives a SILVER 1975 PONTIAC TRANS-AM. Norma drives a
          WHITE 1976 OLDSMOBILE STATION WAGON with WOOD WALLS.
          They pull out onto MONUMENT AVENUE, cars pointing in opposite
          directions. Arthur rolls down his window.

                         ARTHUR
          It's your Christmas present.

                         NORMA
          From you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          B.

                         ARTHUR
          From your secret lover.

                         (BEAT)
          Mr. Steward.
          She furrows her brow.

                         NORMA

                         (SARCASTIC)
          I hate you, Rex Morgan MD.

                         ARTHUR

                         (PLAYFUL)
          I hate you, too.

                         NORMA
          Don't be late tonight.

                         ARTHUR
          I've got your present at work. It's
          almost finished.
          He smiles... then peels off down Monument Ave.
          From Norma's REAR VIEW MIRROR... Arthur's car disappears down
          the road. She reaches up to re-adjust... her eyes appear in
          the mirror's reflection.
          INSERT: Norma's VIRGINIA license plate.
          The Oldsmobile drives down the street in the opposite
          direction.

          EXT. DOWNTOWN RICHMOND -- MORNING

          HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA crests over the barren WINTER
          FOREST on the southeast side of the city... tipping up to
          reveal DOWNTOWN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.

          RADIO VOICE (V.0.)
          It's twenty-three degrees on this
          December morning here in
          Richmond...
          The CAMERA moves over the DOWNTOWN EXPRESSWAY... heavy
          traffic moves in either direction.
          The CAMERA approaches the side of ARTHUR'S TRANS-AM as it
          crests around the INTERSTATE EXCHANGE onto ROUTE 64 at the
          HISTORICAL CLOCK TOWER of MAIN STREET TRAIN STATION.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          RADIO VOICE (V.0.) (CONT - D)
          The French government, in what was
          seen here as a gesture to President-
          elect Jimmy Carter, announced
          Thursday a further tightening of
          controls over the exportation of
          nuclear technology.
          The CAMERA swoops down alongside the driver's side of
          Arthur's car... moving into the SIDE VIEW MIRROR. His face
          reflected in the mirror... listening to the radio as he
          begins his southbound commute to work.

          EXT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- MORNING

          The CAMERA pulls back from .a sign at the entrance to
          COLLEGIATE... an exclusive PRIVATE SCHOOL. Norma's STATION
          WAGON pulls into the school parking lot.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          The CAMERA tracks with Norma as makes her way through the
          CROWDED HALLWAY... filled with LOUD TEENAGERS from the age of
          9-18. Her limp. has gotten worse.
          She WINKS at someone... then turns a corner and the CAMERA
          whips around to reveal WALTER standing at his locker. He
           closes the door, revealing Dana and another friend named
          CHARLES ( 12) standing there.

                         DANA
          Why does your mom limp?

                         CHARLES
          Yeah... is something wrong with her
          foot?

                         WALTER
          That's none of your business.

                         CHARLES
          Dana saw her take her shoe off in
          the parking lot yesterday.

                         DANA
          There's definitely something wrong
          with her foot. It looks mangled.

                         CHARLES
          You didn't say mangled... you said
          it looked gross.
          Walter lunges at Charles and pushes him up against the
          locker... awkwardly trying to fight him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          They continue to wrestle awkwardly for a moment against the
          lockers and then Walter lets go... backing away.

                         WALTER
          If you ever make fun of my mom
          again I'll kill you!
          Walter storms off down the hall.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

          The CAMERA moves through the SCHOOL OFFICE as teachers and
          RECEPTIONISTS move about in preparation for the last day,
          approaching a FROSTED GLASS DOOR that reads:

          DR. WILLIAM H. POATES

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          Norma sits across from the desk of WILLIAM POATES (45), the
          principal of the school.

                         POATES
          The uhhh... the board came to a
          vote last week, so it's official.
          They've officially cancelled the
          faculty tuition discount.

                         NORMA
          So what does that mean for me?

          P OATE S
          You're going to have to start
          paying full tuition for your son.

                         NORMA
          Starting when?

                         POATES
          Next semester.
          Norma notices a SMALL DROP of BLOOD forming in his right
          nostril.

                         NORMA
          Okay.

                         POATES
          I'm real sorry about this, Norma.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         NORMA
          Yeah, me too. I've got three weeks
          to figure out how to tell my son we
          can't afford to send him to
          Collegiate any more.
          The drop of blood has begun to flow down onto his upper lip.

                         POATES
          Like I said, I'm real sorry.

                         NORMA
          Yeah... your nose is bleeding.
          Poates reaches for his HANDKERCHIEF and puts it to his face,
          wiping off the blood. The MORNING BELL rings.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma walks hurriedly down the empty hallway. Her limp has
          gotten worse as the morning grind has now begun.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma comes into her CLASSROOM... a SCIENCE LAB with SINKS
          and BUNSEN BURNERS mounted in MARBLE TOP DESKS. Kids are
          moving about... loud and rambunctious.

                         NORMA
          Okay... everyone quiet down! Take
          your seats!
          Norma moves toward a stack of METAL TRAYS on her desk. Inside
          of each tray is a BALL OF BLACK MUSH.

                         NORMA (CONT-D)
          Today is the day many of you have
          been eagerly awaiting. You get to
          dissect owl pellets.
          A MALE STUDENT ( 13) pumps his fist...

                         MALE STUDENT #1
          Yes!
          Norma sets an OWL PELLET down in front of a FEMALE STUDENT
          ( 12). She looks at the owl pellet in disgust.

                         FEMALE STUDENT #1
          This is so gross.
          Norma sets a tray down in front of Charles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         CHARLES
          Why do they call it an owl pellet?
          A MALE STUDENT ( 12) next to him takes his tray from Norma.

                         MALE STUDENT #2
          Because they shit out of their
          mouths.

                         NORMA
          Hey... watch the language. You say
          another cuss word I've gotta send
          you to detention, okay?

                         MALE STUDENT #2
          Sorry, Mrs. Lewis.

                         FEMALE STUDENT #1
          Is it true?

                         NORMA
          Is what true?

                         FEMALE STUDENT #1
          That owls poo out of their mouths.

                         NORMA
          Yes... this is true.
          The classroom gasps in disgust... others laugh.

                         NORMA (CONT-D)
          Grey forest owls feed upon field
          mice, squirrels and small birds.
          The owl will then regurgitate the
          bones and waste matter in a ball of
          black mucous. Inside this mucous
          you will likely find the entire
          skeleton of its prey.
          Norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a SCREEN.

                         NORMA (CONT-D)
          I'm going to show you a film about
          the digestive process of the owl,
          and how the owl pellet is formed.
          The classroom whispers with excitement.

          EXT. NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER -- ENTRANCE GATE -- MORNING

          Arthur pulls through the ENTRANCE GATE at the NASA LANGLEY
          RESEARCH CENTER. He retrieves his BADGE from the dashboard
          and shows it to the guard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          EXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur's car drives down MAIN STREET on the campus of the
          research center. The buildings are predominately drab,
          functional, one story brick structures.. surrounded by
          various GLOBE STRUCTURES and PIPE NETWORKS on manicured green
          lawns.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

          The CAMERA tracks with Arthur as he moves through the crowded
          corridor of one of the research buildings. He says hello to
          various colleagues along the way.
          All of the men at the facility are dressed the same... with
          white shirts and TIES and POCKET PROTECTOR BADGES. The place
          resembles an all-male community college for young scientists.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MEDIA ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur eases his way into the small, crowded AUDITORIUM that
          serves as a MEDIA ROOM. A PRESS CONFERENCE is underway.
          NORM CAHILL ( 40s), the VIKING PROJECT COORDINATOR, is
           standing at the podium. Next to him is an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR
          with maps and various schematics projected from it onto a

          LARGE SCREEN.

                         REPORTER #1
          It's been five months since the
          Viking lander touched down on the
          surface of Mars. We've seen dozens
          of photographs of the rock covered
          surface... what can you now tell us
          about the tests you've been
          conducting? Is there any sign of
          life on the red planet?
          Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium.

                         CAHILL
          Well... there are three separate
          tests that we've been conducting...
          Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release
          and Gas Exchange. The first two
          tests, based on soil samples about
          22 centimeters deep, came back
          negative... and the third is...
          still pending.
          Cahill smiles. Laughter erupts from various parts of the
          auditorium.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         REPORTER #1
          Can you elaborate on test number
          three?
          Cahill places a transparent MAP of the mars surface on the
          overhead projector and begins to draw on it with a WAX

          PENCIL.

                         CAHILL
          The gas exchange experiment
          measures the production or uptake
          of C02, nitrogen, methane,
          hydrogen, and oxygen during the
          incubation of the martian soil
          sample.

                         REPORTER #2
          Are you showing us all of the
          photos? Are there little green men
          up there?
          Laughter from the press.

                         CAHILL
          Well... there is a possibility that
          the planet abounds with chemical
          compounds produced by living
          systems. Their chemical nature,
          distribution and structural
          uniqueness could be used to argue
          the presence of microscopic living
          organisms on Mars.
          As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the
          reporter on the shoulder.

                         ARTHUR
          It all comes down to water.
          Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia
          Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity
          of the site where VIKING II landed.
          There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.

                         ARTHUR (CONT-D)
          If we find water beneath the
          surface... and the topographic maps
          of Utopia Planitia indicate that
          there were once rivers on the
          surface of the planet, it's
          possible that we'll eventually find
          evidence of life.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATER

          The OWL PELLET FILM is underway. Norma sits in the back of
          the class next to the projector. She crosses her legs...
          reaching for her foot... massaging it gently. She cringes...
          clearly in intense pain.
          Charles looks back at her... noticing this. They make eye
          contact... and Charles turns back to the screen.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CAHILL'S OFFICE -- MORNING

          Arthur now sits across from Cahill in his office. Behind him
          is a window that overlooks a huge laboratory.

                         CAHILL
          I'm sorry Arthur, but they've
          denied your application to be
          admitted into the astronaut
          program.
          Arthur looks crushed.

                         ARTHUR
          I see.

                         (BEAT)
          Can I ask why?

                         CAHILL
          I'm sorry, son... but they don't
          tell us why.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- LATER ON

          The CAMERA tracks through a LARGE LABORATORY in the heart of
          one of the main buildings on the Langley campus.
          Work tables assembled with LABORATORY EQUIPMENT and MACHINERY
          extend out into infinity as DOZENS OF YOUNG MEN, all dressed
          in similar white shirts with NASA ID BADGES move throughout,
          engaged in various tasks.
          Arthur is standing at a LABORATORY TABLE with a WHITE MASK
          on. He is wearing a LAB COAT and GLASSES.
          He pours PINK LIQUID onto the surface of a METAL PAN...
          filling it to the edges.
          A colleague named WENDELL JAMES ( 29) walks over to see what
          he is doing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         ARTHUR
          Are they really with-holding some
          of the Mars photos?

                         WENDELL
          I don't know, man. Jesus... what's
          that smell?

                         ARTHUR
          It's a salinic compound.

                         WENDELL
          What are you making?

                         ARTHUR
          Christmas present for Norma.
          Arthur retrieves a WHITE CERAMIC MOLD. The mold has an
          extrusion that is shaped like a WOMAN'S FOOT... only the end
          of the foot is round and missing its toes, save for the PINKY

          TOE.

                         WENDELL
          A new prosthesis for her foot?

                         ARTHUR
          Yep.
          Arthur carefully impresses the MOLD of his wife's foot into
          the pink goop... sealing the mold at the edges into the tray.

                         WENDELL
          What did you change up this time?

                         ARTHUR
          The compound they're developing for
          the pilot chairs on the space
          shuttle.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT

          INSERT: The BONES of a FIELD MOUSE have been re-assembled in
          rough form within the tray... as the OWL PELLET has been
          ripped apart.
          The tray belongs to Charles, and he has grown tired of
          dissecting the owl pellet.
          He looks up to the head of the class and sees that Norma is
          sitting up on her desk... filing her nails... waiting out the
          last remaining minutes of the period.

                         CHARLES
          Mrs. Lewis?

          She raises her head.

                         NORMA
          Hmmm?

                         CHARLES
          What happened to your foot?
          She just stares at him.

                         NORMA
          What happened... to my foot?

                         CHARLES
          Yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          My friend... she saw you take your
          shoe off. She said... that there's
          something wrong with it.
          The whole class goes silent. Norma begins to blush. She looks
          down at her right foot, hidden inside of a CLOSED-TOE SHOE.

                         NORMA
          Well... it's a long story.
          She looks at her watch.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          We've got five minutes until second
          period.
          She looks back at her class and sees that their curiosity has
          been piqued. She has no choice now but to tell them.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Alright... I'll tell you what
          happened to my foot.

          Arthur sits at the table with Wendell... waiting for the MOLD
          to dry. Arthur is dealing a deck of cards as they begin a
          game of GIN RUMMY.

                         ARTHUR
          When she was seventeen... still
          living in Texas, her brother
          dropped a barbell on her foot...
          broke three of her toes.

          The CAMERA pans across the faces of STUDENTS as they listen
          to her tell the story.

                         NORMA
          And so I go to see the doctor. He
          goes to take an X-ray of my foot to
          see if the bones are broken.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT

          Arthur discards... then retrieves a replacement card from the
          stack.

                         ARTHUR
          So this dumb-ass Richmond doctor
          takes the x-ray... then he goes to
          check on another patient down the
          hall.
          Arthur discards a king.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          This dumb--ass... he left the x-ray
          machine on.

                         WENDELL
          Jesus. That's not good.

          Norma raises up her right shoe to show the class.

                         NORMA
          They found out that the tissue in
          four of my toes had been completely

                         I
          destroyed by the radiation.
          Norma swivels around on the desk and places her right foot
          against her left inner thigh.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          So they have to amputate four of my
          toes. And then they had to take a
          bunch of skin from my inner thigh
          to cover the front of my foot. This
          is back in 1963... so they didn't
          have the skin graft techniques they
          do now.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT

          Arthur stands up and takes his RIGHT FOOT... pulls it up and
          touches it to his LEFT INNER THIGH.

                         ARTHUR
          She had to sit there in a hospital
          bed in the same position for six
          months, waiting for it to heal.
          Wendell stares at the mold on the laboratory table.

                         WENDELL
          Jesus. I hope she sued this idiot.

                         ARTHUR
          Oh yeah. Her family sued. They won.

                         WENDELL
          What was the settlement?

                         ARTHUR
          Forty thousand dollars.
          Arthur pulls the ceramic mold out of the pink goop... and we
          see the IMPRESSION of her disfigured foot inside the new

          PROSTHESIS.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT

          Norma turns around and uncrosses her legs. They now dangle
          over the edge of the lab desk.

                         NORMA
          You guys want to see it? Now that
          the secret is out... I don't want
          you spreading rumors about my
          mangled foot.
          The class responds enthusiastically.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Come on... gather round... take a
          look at the freak show.
          As the kids gather around... Norma removes her right shoe and
          reveals her disfigured foot... missing every toe but her
          pinky. A rounded piece of SCAR TISSUE covers the rest of it.

          Arthur takes the trimmed PROSTHESIS and wraps it in tissue
          paper, then places it in a CARDBOARD BOX with a red bow on
          it.

                         ARTHUR
          If this sucker works... she can,
          start jogging again.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MIDDAY

          Dana walks up to Walter as he stands in front of his locker.

                         DANA
          I'm sorry I said that her foot
          looked gross.

                         WALTER
          It doesn't look gross... it looks
          cool. And if you can't tell the
          difference between gross and
          cool... then I feel sorry for you,
          Dana.
          Walter walks off... leaving her alone.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

          Norma emerges from her car carrying GROCERY BAGS in both
          arms. Walter comes out of the garage with his bike.

                         NORMA
          Hey honey.

                         WALTER
          Why do I need a baby-sitter?

                         NORMA
          Because you're nine years old.
          You're not a geezer yet.

                         WALTER
          It's 1976, mom. Times are changing.
          Nine years old isn't what it used
          to be. I think I'm ready to get a
          moped.

                         NORMA
          We're not buying you a moped,
          Walter. Stick with the bike... and
          be home before dark.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         WALTER
          Fine.
          Walter rides off down the street.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          Norma comes into the foyer, groceries in hand. The PHONE is
          ringing.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma comes into the kitchen, sets the groceries down on the
          kitchen table. She grabs the phone off the wall and puts it
          to her ear.

                         NORMA
          Hello?
          There is silence on the other end of the line.

                         NORMA (CONT-D)
          Hello?
          A MOMENT OF SILENCE... then the caller disconnects.
          Norma hangs up the phone and starts unloading the groceries.
          The box sits on the table... but she takes no notice of it.

          EXT. GYMNASIUM -- EARLY EVENING

          Arthur emerges from a NASA CAMPUS GYMNASIUM into the twilight
          with Wendell. Both are covered in sweat, dressed in gym
          clothes. Arthur is carrying his BASKETBALL and a gym bag.

                         WENDELL
          How's the commute back to Richmond?

                         ARTHUR
          Not too bad. Maybe an hour and
          twenty minutes.

                         WENDELL
          Tell Norma I said hello.
          Wendell watches him walk across the lawn to the parking
          lot... approaching his car. He lights a cigarette and takes a
          drag... then looks at his watch.
          INSERT: His watch shows that it is 4:58 PM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

          Norma sits on the couch... smoking a CIGARETTE. On the
          TELEVISION... the LOCAL NEWS is playing.
          The DOORBELL rings.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          Norma opens the front door.
          A man named ARLINGTON STEWARD (40) is standing there, his
          body is turned in profile. He is wearing a crisp wool suit
          and a BLACK HAT, with a BRIEFCASE in his right hand.

                         ARLINGTON
          Mrs. Lewis?

                         NORMA
          Yeah.

                         ARLINGTON
          My name is Arlington Steward.
          Her eyes light up, as she remembers the name and the box.
          Arlington then rotates his body... revealing the RIGHT SIDE
          of his face. Norma's eyes widen in horror at what she sees.
          Nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone
          to his lower jaw has been burned away. His rear MOLARS and
          GUMS are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is
          supposed to conceal them.
          Norma immediately feels a strange connection... a deep
          sympathy for him and the pain he must have endured.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT-D)
          I assume you received the box that
          I left on your doorstep.
          His speech has a slight impediment from the burn that extends
          to the right side of his mouth.

                         NORMA
          Oh, yes. Yes we did.

                         ARLINGTON
          And you retrieved the button unit
          inside of the box.
          Norma smiles. He smiles back at her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         NORMA
          The button unit. That's what you
          call it?

                         ARLINGTON
          Indeed. May I come in?

                         NORMA
          Sure.
          Norma turns and leads him back into the kitchen. She
          retrieves the button unit from the table.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          So what it this thing? I assume
          you're trying to sell me something?

                         ARLINGTON
          Well... in a way, yes. I do have an
          offer to make.

                         NORMA
          Yeah? What are you selling?

                         ARLINGTON
          A financial opportunity.
          Arlington gestures toward the table with his briefcase.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          May I?
          She nods. He places the briefcase down on the table.
          He takes the button unit from her and sets it down on the
          kitchen table. They both sit down.
          He then withdraws a SMALL YELLOW ENVELOPE from his suit
          jacket pocket.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          inside of this envelope is a key.
          Arlington opens the envelope and withdraws a small METAL KEY.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          This is the key that opens the
          glass dome of the button unit.
          Arlington then inserts the key into a small HORIZONTAL SLOT
          at the top edge. He turns the key, and the LID that houses
          the GLASS DOME pops lose.
          The METAL BUTTON is now exposed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          If you push the button, one of two
          things will happen.

                         (BEAT)
          First, someone... somewhere in the
          world... who you do not know...
          will die.
          Norma just stares at him.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Then, you will receive a payment of
          two-hundred thousand dollars... tax
          free.
          Arlington opens the briefcase. Inside are neatly stacked rows
          of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          The money will be delivered to you
          in cash.
          Norma covers her mouth... shocked at the sight of so much
          money.

                         NORMA
          Are you for real?
          Arlington smiles back at her.

                         ARLINGTON
          Mrs. Lewis, I can assure you that
          the offer is real.

                         NORMA
          Who do you work for?

                         ARLINGTON
          The guarantee of payment has
          several restrictions. One... I am
          not permitted to disclose any
          information about to the identity
          of my employers.

                         (BEAT)
          Two... if you discuss the details
          of this financial opportunity with
          anyone other than your husband, the
          offer is null and void, and you
          will not receive the money in
          return for having pushed the
          button.

                         (BEAT)
          Three... you have twenty four
          hours.
          Arlington glances at his watch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          You have until five o'clock
          tomorrow evening to make your
          decision whether or not to push the
          button. At that time, I will return
          to retrieve the button unit from
          you. It will be re-programmed and
          the offer will be made to someone
          else.
          Arlington places the key back into the envelope, seals it
          with crisp precision, and hands it over to her.
          He then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Until then... a good day to you,
          Mrs. Lewis.
          He nods his head and turns toward the foyer.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          She follows him toward the front door.

                         NORMA
          Wait a minute... you're just going
          to leave me with this thing.

                         (BAFFLED)
          Is this some kind of joke? Who are
          you?
          He opens the front door and turns back to her with a friendly
          smile.

                         ARLINGTON
          My name is Arlington Steward, and I
          can assure you that this is no
          joke. The offer is real, but I am
          not at liberty to disclose any more
          information than I already have.
          He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Good day.
          He heads down the walk toward his car.
          She looks down at the card and sees that his name is printed
          in an embossed BLACK FONT:

                         ARLINGTON STEWARD

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          She turns the card over and sees what looks like a PHONE
          NUMBER printed on the back:

                         8 0 4 7 9 4 1 7 7 9
          She stands there in the doorway and watches him step into the
          automobile, start the engine and drive off.

          EXT. CARYTOWN SHOPPING CENTER -- AFTERNOON

          Walter is sitting on a bench in front of a line of shops in
          CARYTOWN. Dana approaches him.
          He turns to face her.

                         WALTER
          What do you want?

                         DANA
          I'm sorry. I just wanted to tell
          you... that I think your mom is
          beautiful.
          Walter just stares at her in silence... wanting to forgive
          her.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma walks back into the kitchen, holding the key envelope
          in one hand and the business card in the other.
          She stares at them both, then down at the box. She then
          retrieves the key from the envelope and inserts it into the
          slot, opening the glass dome.
          She stares at the button for a long moment... then closes the
          dome. She closes her eyes... trying to make sense of what has
          just transpired.

          INT. BURNS HOUSE -- NEXT

          The CAMERA zooms out from a RINGING PHONE that sits on a
          KITCHEN COUNTER in a large suburban house. SUSAN BURNS (50s)
          goes to answer the phone.

                         SUSAN
          Hello?

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          Hey mom.

                         SUSAN
          Hey honey. What's up?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          Nothing... I just...
           The CAMERA continues to zoom out, revealing her husband, JIM
          BURNS (50s) laid out in a recliner, watching television.

                         SUSAN
          Is something wrong?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma stares at the business card.

                         NORMA
          No... something just happened
          and...

                         SUSAN (PHONE)
          What?

                         NORMA
          Nothing. I don't want to talk about
          it right now.

          INT. BURNS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

          Susan carries the phone into the family room

                         SUSAN
          Alright.
          (covering the phone)
          Jim... you gotta get ready.

                         JIM
          Alright.
          He sits up and moves toward the stairs.

                         SUSAN
          Wait until you see the spread
          tonight.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma twirls the phone cord around her finger.

                         NORMA
          Hmmm. I think they're spending more
          on their wedding than we did on our
          house.

                         SUSAN (PHONE)
          Is your foot acting up again?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          Norma leans against the wall... lifting her right foot off
          the floor to ease the pain.

                         NORMA
          A little, yeah. That damn bone. The
          skin from my leg, it's not as tough
          as it should be.

                         SUSAN (PHONE)
          You know he's gonna be there
          tonight.

                         NORMA
          Who?

                         SUSAN
          Dr. Stupid.
          Norma takes this in... remembering...

                         NORMA
          Well... it's been what... thirteen
          years? Bound to run into each other
          at some point, right?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BATHROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma is now wearing only her BRA AND PANTIES, her hair and
          make-up flawless. She finishes putting on a pair of DIAMOND

          EARRINGS.
          As she steps into an elegant COCKTAIL DRESS... we see the
          deep square shaped SCARS on the inside of her LEFT THIGH.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Norma comes into the bedroom... and ARTHUR is there...
          putting on his CUFF LINKS. He is dressed in a TUXEDO.
          His jacket is laid out on the bed, and next to it is his
          CHRISTMAS PRESENT. Norma sees it.

                         NORMA
          What's this?

                         ARTHUR
          A little gift from Dr. Rex Morgan.
          She opens the present and retrieves the PROSTHESIS.

                         NORMA
          Oh my god!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Norma removes an old, store-bought INSOLE from her right shoe
          and inserts the new one.

                         ARTHUR
          It's a material they developed for
          the new shuttle chairs. It'll
          absorb the pressure of your foot
          and re-distribute it across the
          entire surface area.
          She then slides her disfigured foot into the shoe... and
          begins to walk around the room.

                         NORMA
          Oh my God, Rex... how'd you do it?

                         ARTHUR
          I just figured out a way to make it
          better.
          She crosses the room and gives him a hug and a kiss.

                         NORMA
          I don't know what I'd do without
          you.

                         ARTHUR
          Merry Christmas, June.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma and Arthur come into the family room, wearing their
          winter coats. Walter is sitting across the coffee table with
          Dana. They are playing CARDS.
          The box is sitting between them.

                         WALTER
          Did Mr. Steward show up?
          Norma sees the box sitting there and immediately grabs it off
          the table.

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah... what's it all about. Did he
          show up?

                         NORMA
          Yeah... I'll tell you about it in
          the car. We're running late.
          Norma leans down and kisses Walter on the cheek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          We'll be home late... your bedtime
          is ten.
          Dana watches them go... her eyes transfixed on the box in
          Norma's hands.

          EXT. RIVER ROAD -- NIGHT

          The CAMERA tracks with Arthur's car as it drives south on
          CARY STREET... approaching an intersection.

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT

          Norma has the box sitting in her lap while Arthur drives.

                         NORMA
          And before I could ask him anything
          else... he got in his car... and he
          pulled off.

                         ARTHUR
          Did you get the license plate?

                         NORMA
          No.

                         ARTHUR
          Your dad is cop, Norma. Always get
          the license plate number.

                         NORMA
          I was little overwhelmed, Arthur.

                         ARTHUR
          Somewhere in the world... someone
          you do not know will die.

                         NORMA
          Those were his exact words.

                         ARTHUR
          Did he say how they would die?

                         NORMA
          No.

                         ARTHUR
          And he showed you the cash.

                         NORMA
          Yeah. He said it was two-hundred
          thousand. It looked real to me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         ARTHUR
          What did he look like?

                         NORMA
          You don't want to know. I think
          he's a burn victim. Poor thing...
          half of his face is gone.

                         ARTHUR
          Really?

                         NORMA
          I think maybe he's a life insurance
          salesman. Maybe that's what it is.
          It's some kind of survey. We push
          the button and he offers us a
          discount on a two-hundred thousand
          dollar life insurance policy.
          Joke's on us.

          EXT. COUNTRY CLUB OF VIRGINIA -- NIGHT

          The CAMERA descends upon the COUNTRY CLUB OF VIRGINIA. It is
          a MASSIVE COLONIAL MANSION that sits upon a huge hill that is
          littered with CHRISTMAS LUMINARIES that glow in the night.

          EXT. C.C.V. -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

          We approach Arthur's car as they pull into a PARKING SPACE in
          front of the main entrance.

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT

          Arthur grabs the box from off her lap.

                         ARTHUR
          Did you bring the key with you?
          She hands it to him.
          He takes the key and inserts it... opening the glass dome.
          He then takes his INDEX FINGER and places it on the button.

                         NORMA
          What the hell are you doing?!

                         ARTHUR

                         (PLAYFUL)
          I was gonna push the button.

                         NORMA
          No!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Norma reaches over and snaps the dome closed.

                         ARTHUR
          You think it's for real.
          She takes the box back from him.

                         NORMA
          I don't know. He was... he seemed
          very sure of himself. If it's some
          kind of survey... then... he's a
          really good salesman because I
          believe him. I believe that he
          might give us that money.

                         ARTHUR
          Do then you think he's a maniac and
          he might go kill someone?

                         NORMA
          I don't know.
          Arthur takes the box back from her. He shakes it... then
          flips it over. He sees that there is a SINGLE SCREW on the
          bottom corner that holds it together.

                         ARTHUR
          Open the glove compartment. There's
          a philips head screwdriver in
          there.
          She opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT and retrieves a PHILLIPS HEAD
          SCREWDRIVER for him.

                         NORMA
          What are you doing?
          Arthur is now unscrewing the bottom of the box.

                         ARTHUR
          I'm gonna see what's inside of it.
          He removes the screw... and sees that the wooden base rotates
          on a ROD MOUNT on the opposite corner.
          INSIDE... it is completely empty.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Nothing... no transmitter... no
          radio. If we pushed the button
          right now... he'd have no way of
          knowing.
          She takes the box from him and closes the dome.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          EXT. C.C.V. -- PARI:ING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur pops open the trunk and Norma places the box inside.
          He shuts the trunk and they begin to walk toward the entrance
          to the COUNTRY CLUB. Arthur then holds out his hand to his
          wife.

                         ARTHUR
          Let me hold the key.

                         NORMA
          Why do you get to hold it?

                         ARTHUR
          Because you'll lose it Norma. You
          can't hold your liquor.

                         NORMA
          Neither can you.

                         ARTHUR
          What if someone takes your purse? I
          have pockets. Let me hold it.

                         NORMA
          Fine.
          Norma goes through her purse and hands the small envelope to
          him. They move toward the entrance to the country club.

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          The CAMERA follows Norma and Arthur into the GRAND BALLROOM
          of the country club. There are several hundred people
          there... all dressed in black tie. A MASSIVE CHRISTMAS TREE
          sits in the center of the room, surrounded by tables.
          A PIANO PLAYER plays CHRISTMAS CAROLS up on the stage.

                         NORMA
          Jesus. All this for a rehearsal
          dinner... Deborah is so lucky.
          Remember our rehearsal dinner?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah. Keg party in our back yard.
           Susan and Jim are standing with ARTHUR LEWIS, SR (50s) and
          BEV LEWIS ( 50s). Arthur and Norma go over to greet them.
           The CAMERA drifts over to a PLACARD that reads:

           DEBORAH ANNE BURNS - EDWARD REED POWELL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          REHEARSAL DINNER RECEPTION

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

          Dana enters the family room and hands a package to Walter.

                         DANA
          Merry Christmas...
          Walter takes the package and begins to remove the wrapping
          paper.
          Inside is a COMIC BOOK. He pulls it out of the wrapping...
          and on the cover is an illustration of a DARK FIGURE walking
          upon a RED DESERT SURFACE.
          The title is: THE MAN FROM MARS
          Walter looks at the cover in awe.

                         WALTER
          Thanks Dana. My dad is gonna love
          this.

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma and Arthur are now seated around a table with both sets
          of parents. Bev is running her hand through Arthur's long
          hair.

                         BEV
          When are you gonna cut this hair?

                         ARTHUR
          Never.

                         BEV

                         (TO NORMA)
          Are you still cutting his hair?

                         NORMA
          Uh-huh.

          ARTHUR SR.
          Are you Leonard or Skynard?

                         BEV
          Well honey... they're never gonna
          let you into outer space with these
          sideburns.

                         SUSAN
          They're all wearing them that way
          now, Bev.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          NATHAN BURNS ( 26), Norma's wheelchair-bound younger brother,
          comes rolling up.

                         NATHAN
          Outer space? Is someone planning on
          departing the surface of the earth?

                         ARTHUR
          Nathan!
          Arthur stands up and gives him a hug.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          It's been years. How have you been?

                         NATHAN
          I've been better... I mean, I used
          to have legs...
          The table goes silent... Susan looks as though she might
          start to cry.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry... morbid humor. What's this
          talk about outer space?

                         NORMA
          Arthur has been working at Nasa.

                         JIM
          He helped design the camera that
          photographed the Mars surface.
          Arthur puts his hands on the back of Nathan's wheelchair.

                         ARTHUR
          Nathan and I are gonna go grab a
          drink...
          He begins to wheel Nathan toward the bar.

                         NORMA
          Arthur made me a new prosthesis for
          my foot. Some space age formula...
          it's incredible.

                         JIM
          Can he make Nathan a pair of
          prosthetic legs?

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur now sits with Nathan over by the bar.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         NATHAN
          Can you believe it? I survive
          eighteen months crawlling through
          the Vietnam jungle and not one
          bullet so much as grazes my body.

                         (BEAT)
          And I come home, take a few tabs of
          LSD at a Grateful Dead show and
          wrap my car around a tree.
          Arthur doesn't know how to respond.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Pretty damn sad... losing the legs
          that way, but I always thought it
          was Karmic retribution for what I
          did to Norma.

                         ARTHUR
          What'd you ever do to Norma?

                         NATHAN
          I dropped that barbell on her foot
          when we were kids. That's why she
          went to get that x-ray. If it
          wasn't for me... she'd still have
          all her toes.

                         ARTHUR
          You can't think of it that way.

                         NATHAN
          Why not? It's the truth.

                         ARTHUR
          You didn't leave the x-ray machine
          on, Dr. Stupid did.

                         NATHAN
          Yeah, but my mistake sent her to
          Dr. Stupid... so that makes me
          culpable in the eyes of Buddha.

                         ARTHUR
          You're no more culpable than the
          company that manufactured the
          barbell. Stop punishing yourself.
          Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack
          Daniels.

                         NATHAN
          You know he's here.

                         ARTHUR
          Who?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         NATHAN
          Dr. Stupid.
          Nathan nods his head across the room... where DR. EARL STUPE
          ( 50s) is seated at a table with his wife.

                          NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Dr. Earl Stupe. He's still got a
          practice over on the west end.
          Arthur looks over at him... for a moment they make brief eye
          contact... and Stupe quickly looks away.

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- NEXT

          Susan is now staring at Dr. Stupe. They are joined by DEBORAH
          BURNS (24), Norma's younger sister and bride-to-be.

                         SUSAN
          I wonder if he even recognizes us.

                         JIM
          I'm sure he does.

                         DEBORAH
          I can't believe they still let him
          practice medicine.

                         NORMA
          You gotta let it go. You gotta
          learn to forgive and forget.

                         SUSAN
          I'd be willing to forgive him if he
          would've just admitted his
          negligence under oath. The bastard
          lied... said it was the x-ray
          machine that malfunctioned.
          SENATOR GRIFFITH POWELL (50s) and his son EDWARD POWELL
          ( 20s), approach. Edward is the husband-to-be.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
          Well Senator! You look very spiffy
          tonight!

                         POWELL
          Now that the mid-term elections are
          over... the smile lines are
          starting to fade.
          Powell puts on a fake smile, grabs Jim's hand and they both
          wave... poking fun at politician behavior.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         SUSAN
          Well... we all voted!
          Powell looks over at Norma.

                         POWELL
          Norma... right?

                         NORMA
          That's right.
          He shakes her hand... fascinated by her.

                         POWELL
          And you're married to the aspiring
          astronaut.

                         NORMA
          That's right. There he is right
          over there.
          She points over to Arthur the bar. Powell looks over at
          him... and they briefly make eye contact.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

          Dana and Walter are sitting on the floor, playing MONOPOLY.

                         DANA
          Walter?

                         WALTER
          Yeah?

                         DANA
          Will you take me down to the
          basement? I want to see your dad's
          darkroom.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- BASEMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

          Dana and Walter come down the stairs into the BASEMENT of the
          house. RED LIGHT envelops the room. There are two long wooden
          WORK BENCHES running down the middle.
          There are a series of BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS hanging
          from a wire. Each one shows a different view of the surface
          of MARS.

                         DANA
          Is that Mars?

                         WALTER
          Yep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         DANA
          What did your dad have to do with
          the Viking?

                         WALTER
          He helped design the camera.
          Walter points to a PLASTIC PROTOTYPE MODEL of the VIKING
          LANDER mounted on a third WORK BENCH at the end of the room.
          A model of the MARS SURFACE has been re-created and painted
          with exacting detail.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          He's making the model for the
          science museum.
          Walter points to one of TWO CAMERAS mounted on the front of
          the SPIDER-SHAPED LANDING MODULE. The camera is cylindrical
          and features a VERTICAL SLOT on the front.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          They designed the camera to
          photograph in 360 degrees. It scans
          in the image one line at a time...
          and takes about five minutes to
          complete one revolution.

                         DANA
          How do they get the images back to
          earth?

                         WALTER
          Radio transmission. They figured
          out a way to interpret the scan
          lines and then print them onto
          film.

                         DANA
          How long does it take to transmit
          back to earth?

                         WALTER
          About ten hours.
          Dana looks over at the wall and sees a NEW YORK TIMES FRONT
          PAGE from September with a large image of MARS on it.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          They tested the camera in the
          parking lot at Langley last year.
          Walter points to another FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. In
          the black & white photograph, we see a group of FIFTY NASA
          EMPLOYEES assembled in a long line in a PARKING LOT.
          Walter points to his father standing in the group.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          There's my dad.
          He moves his finger across the line of smiling faces...
          ARTHUR appears for a SECOND TIME in the row.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          And there he is again.
          Walter then moves his finger down toward the right side of
          the photo... ARTHUR LEWIS appears for a third time.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          And there he is again.
          Dana looks close at the photo.

                         DANA
          How'd he do that?

                         WALTER
          Because the camera takes five
          minutes to scan in 360 degrees, he
          waited until the camera passed over
          him then jumped ahead in the
          circle.
          The CAMERA moves in closer to the photograph... to the THIRD
          VERSION of ARTHUR LEWIS.

                         DANA
          Your dad sounds pretty clever.

                         WALTER
          My dad is more than just clever,
          Dana. My dad is the coolest man who
          ever walked the face of the earth.
          The CAMERA ZOOMS in close to Arthur's face... then tips down
          to another MAN kneeling on the pavement directly below him.
          It is ARLINGTON STEWARD... smiling at the camera. His face is
          normal... no evidence of any burn visible...

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

          Norma and Arthur are now DANCING among a group of people in
          front of the stage the stage, where a WOMAN SINGER is
          performing WHITE CHRISTMAS.

                         NORMA
          Two-hundred thousand dollars is a
          lot of money, Arthur.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         ARTHUR
          What would we do with that kind of
          money?

                         NORMA
          We could get out of Richmond...
          move to California.

                         ARTHUR
          Then we could cross the border into
          Mexico if they ever came after us.

                         NORMA
          You can't arrest someone for
          pushing a button, Arthur. It's not
          a weapon. It's not a gun. We
          wouldn't be culpable... not in a
          court of law.

                         ARTHUR
          What if it's someone's baby?

                         NORMA
          What if it's some murderer on death
          row in China?

                         ARTHUR
          What if it's our neighbor across
          the street. Do you know our
          neighbors across the street? Have
          you ever met them?

                         NORMA
          Yeah. Doug and Donna.

                         ARTHUR
          Hmmm. I haven't met Doug or Donna.

                         (BEAT)
          What does it mean to officially
          know someone, anyway? Do you know
          me, Norma?

                         NORMA
          I know you better than you know
          yourself.

                         ARTHUR
          Do you know Walter?

                         NORMA
          Even better than I know you.
          They spin around on the dance floor.

                         ARTHUR
          It's just a stupid prank, Norma.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         NORMA
          Life insurance.
          Arthur gazes across the ballroom toward the bar. Nathan sits
          there alone... finishing his drink.

          EXT. C.C.V. -- PARKING LOT --LATER THAT NIGHT

          Arthur and Norma watch as Jim hoists Nathan up into their VAN
          with a HYDRAULIC LIFT. He is passed out drunk.
          Behind him... Dr. Stupe is waiting in line at the valet for
          his car. He and Norma make eye contact. His eyes dart down to
          the pavement as he steps into his car.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma and Arthur come into the family room. Dana is asleep on
          the couch. Norma sets the box down on the coffee table and
          goes to wake Dana.

                         NORMA
          Dana...
          Dana's eyes slowly open.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Arthur will drive you home, okay?

                         DANA
          I have my bike... and my house
          isn't far from here.

                         NORMA
          Where's Walter?

                         DANA
          He's asleep upstairs.
          Arthur hands Dana a ten dollar bill.

                         ARTHUR
          Are you sure you don't need a ride?

                         DANA
          I'm sure.

                         ARTHUR
          Good night, Dana.
          Dana exits through the front door. Norma stands up and moves
          toward the foyer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         NORMA
          Can you turn off the Christmas tree
          lights?

                         ARTHUR
          I like leaving them on.

                         NORMA
          It's a fire hazard.

                         ARTHUR
          It keeps the Christmas spirit alive
          while we sleep.

                         NORMA
          We could die.

                         ARTHUR
          Everyone dies eventually, Norma.
          She stares at the tree.

                         NORMA
          Fine. Leave them on.
          She goes upstairs... leaving him alone with the glowing tree.
          Arthur looks down at the coffee table. The box sits there...
          taunting him. He retrieves the KEY ENVELOPE from his pocket
          and stares at it.
          He then walks over to the wall and unplugs the Christmas tree
          lights.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

          Norma and Arthur lay in bed, facing in opposite directions.
          Neither of them can sleep.
          Arthur rolls over and wraps his arm around her.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- WALTER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT

          The CAMERA approaches Walter's bed. He has made a TENT under
          the covers. A light glows from inside.
          UNDER THE COVERS... Walter has a flashlight and he is reading
          the comic book.
          INSERT: Various illustrations from the comic... a HUGE TEMPLE
          with a massive flying beast flying above it. A METEOR
          hurtling toward EARTH...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          ::WT. CARYTOWN E.kT-R S -LO1 -- EARLY MORNING
          At the CARYTOWN HAIR SALON... the CAMERA zooms out from Norma
          as she sits under a DOME, drying her hair. Next to her is her
          sister Deborah and several other BRIDESMAIDS for the wedding.
          The other women are gabbing... reading fashion magazines.
          Norma seems lost in her own world.

          EXT. CARYTOWN HAIR SALON -- LATER ON

          Norma and Deborah emerge from the hair salon with the others
          in tow. Lurking down at the end of the sidewalk is Bud Wall,
          Walter's bus-driver.
          The huge man watches them intensely.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma has Arlington's BUSINESS CARD out. She stares at the
          number. Arthur comes in with the morning paper.
          The box sits on the kitchen table. She retrieves the key and
          inserts it into the slot... opening the glass dome. Arthur
          comes into the kitchen.

                         NORMA
          We'll never see that much money.

                         ARTHUR
          Why do you say that?

                         NORMA
          Be realistic Arthur... you work for
          the government.

                         ARTHUR
          Maybe not forever.

                         NORMA
          We'll never leave Richmond.

                         ARTHUR
          Do you want to move?

                         NORMA
          We have to put Walter in public
          school.

                         ARTHUR
          Why?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         NORMA
          Collegiate withdrew the faculty
          tuition discount.

                         ARTHUR
          No...

                         NORMA
          Yeah. They did.

                         (BEAT)
          Even if we sold my car and moved
          into a smaller house, we couldn't
          afford that school.

                         ARTHUR
          No...

                         NORMA
          We'd have to enroll him at
          Hopewell. Unless...

                         ARTHUR
          Unless what, Norma?
          She reaches out and holds her finger over the button...
          thinking. She then picks up the business card with her other
          hand, flips it over and stares at the number.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Are you gonna call him?

                         NORMA
          Yeah.
          Norma begins to dial the number on the card.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- NEXT

          The CAMERA cranes down into the WILLOW LAWN MOTEL on the
          north side of Richmond. The two-story building has a SWIMMING
          POOL adjacent to south side.

          INT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- ROOM 234 -- NEXT

          The CAMERA zooms out from a RINGING TELEPHONE that sits on
          the bedside table.
          Arlington sits on the bed... staring silently at the wall. He
          picks up the receiver and places it to his ear.

                         ARLINGTON
          Hello Mrs. Lewis.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma pauses for a moment... wondering how he could have
          known it was her.

                         NORMA
          Is this Mr. Steward?

                         ARLINGTON (PHONE)
          Of course it is.

                         NORMA
          How did you know it was me... are
          you tracing this call?

                         ARLINGTON (PHONE)
          Time is running out... have you
          made your decision?
          Norma looks to Arthur... who paces around the kitchen.

                         NORMA
          If we push the button... are you
          going to murder someone?

          INT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- ROOM 234 -- NEXT

          Arlington leans back on the motel room bed.

                         ARLINGTON
          When you push the button...
          somewhere in this world... someone
          you do not know... will die. I
          never mentioned the word murder.

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          How will they die?

                         ARLINGTON
          I'm not at liberty to disclose that
          information. Besides... it would
          spoil the fun.

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          Are you selling life insurance?

                         ARLINGTON
          I am not at liberty to disclose any
          information about my employers. I
          can only remind you that the offer
          is real...
          (looking at his watch)
          .and it expires in approximately
          eight hours.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          Why do you do this? What do you get
          out of this deal?

                         ARLINGTON
          Absolutely nothing. The reward is
          for you.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma paces around with the phone.

                         ARLINGTON (PHONE)
          Is there anything else, Mrs. Lewis?
          I have an appointment to make and I
          don't want to be late.

                         NORMA
          Can we meet in person? I'd like to
          see you... before we make our final
          decision.

                         ARLINGTON
          Why... I'm looking at you right
          now, Norma.

                         NORMA
          Excuse me?

                         ARLINGTON
          The grey spotted owl... in your
          back yard.
          Norma turns and looks out the large picture window in the
          kitchen nook. Outside in the back yard, an OWL is perched on
          a planter.
          The large bird sits motionless... its large SAUCER EYES do
          not blink.
          Norma stares at it for a long moment... transfixed. Arthur
          paces around the kitchen... facing in the other direction.
          Outside... the owl flies away before Arthur notices it.

                         NORMA
          Hello?
          There is no response.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Mr. Steward? Are you still there?
          Norma hangs up the phone. She stares at the box... then at
          her husband, as he sits down across from her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         ARTHUR
          What do you want to do Norma?

                         NORMA
          We're gonna have to pull Walter out
          of that school.

                         ARTHUR
          Then push it.

                         (TAUNTING)
          Push the button, Norma... push the
          button. I dare you. I double-dog
          diddly dare you.

                         NORMA
          I'm scared to.

                         ARTHUR
          Well... if you don't push it...
          then I will.

                         (BEAT)
          This is stupid.
          Arthur reaches out to push the button... but she grabs his
          wrist with her left hand, restraining him.

                         NORMA
          Ladies first.
          She then reaches out and presses down on the button with her
          index finger.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- 911 EMERGENCY -- NEXT

          The CAMERA tracks along a series of CUBICLES at the POLICE
          STATION in downtown Richmond. A FEMALE OPERATOR sits at each
          cubicle...

                         OPERATOR #1
          911 emergency... how may I direct
          your call?

          Excuse me? You need to slow down...
          I can't understand what you're
          saying.
          She listens to the voice on the other end of the line.

                         OPERATOR #1 (CONT'D)
          So you heard loud screaming and
          then a gun shot.

          1500 Cary Street.

          EXT. 1500 CARY STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

          Two POLICE CARS pull up with their SIRENS blaring in front of
          a TOWNHOUSE on Cary Street. TWO POLICE OFFICERS emerge from
          each car and approach the front of the townhouse.
          They begin to bang loudly on the door. A FEMALE NEIGHBOR
          (20s) emerges from the townhouse next door.

                         NEIGHBOR

                         (DISTRAUGHT)
          I heard a gunshot... then he ran
          out the front door and got in his
          car.
          The POLICE OFFICER looks at his partner and then proceeds to
          KICK DOWN the door.

          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- FOYER -- NEXT

           The OFFICERS move through the townhouse with their GUNS
           drawn. The SCREAMING of a YOUNG GIRL can be heard from
          upstairs.

          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

           The OFFICERS enter the kitchen. A WOMAN (20s) named AMY
           BEVILACQUA is slumped over on the kitchen floor in a pool of
          blood.
           The CAMERA moves in toward her face.

          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

           An OFFICER approaches the BATHROOM DOOR at the end of the
          hall. The screaming girl from inside is bawling her eyes out.
          The Officer sees a tiny HAND emerge from underneath the door.
          She is reaching out for help. He goes to open the door, but
          there is a LARGE DEAD BOLT LOCK mounted on the outside.

                         OFFICER #1
          Honey... I need you to back away
          from the door... I'M GONNA HAVE TO

          KICK IT DOWN?
          The screaming begins to subside.

                         OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)

                         FEMALE VOICE
          okay...
          The Officer then kicks the door down.

          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- NEXT

           Inside the bathroom... a YOUNG GIRL (7) is cowering in the
          bathtub... hyperventilating...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma and Arthur are sitting across from one another in
          silence. There is an empty BOTTLE OF WINE on the table.

                         ARTHUR
          There's no turning back now.
          Seconds later... THE DOORBELL RINGS.
          Both Norma and Arthur jump in their seats.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          Norma and Arthur move toward the front door. Norma puts her
          eye to the PEEPHOLE. Arlington's disfigured face stares back
          at her.
          She opens the door. Arlington stands there smiling...
          briefcase in hand.

                         ARLINGTON
          Hello, Mrs. Lewis.

                         NORMA
          Hi.

                         ARLINGTON
          Do you have the button unit?

                         NORMA
          Uhh... yeah... it's in the kitchen.
          Norma goes to the kitchen to retrieve the box, leaving Arthur
          alone with Arlington.

                         ARLINGTON
          And you must be Mr. Lewis.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          Arthur stares at him... transfixed. Does he recognize him
          from somewhere?
          Norma returns with the box and hands it over to him.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          And the key?

                         NORMA
          Oh... sorry...
          Norma reaches into her pocket and retrieves the small
          envelope and places it in his hand.

                         ARLINGTON
          Thank you.
          Arlington then opens the BRIEFCASE and shows it to them.
          Inside... the bills are stacked neatly in rows.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Two-hundred thousand. You can count
          it if you like.
          Arthur takes the briefcase from him and then closes.

                         ARTHUR
          Thanks... we trust your word.
          Arlington offers him a broad smile.

                         ARLINGTON
          As you should.
          He then turns to leave.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- NEXT

          They follow Arlington out onto the front walk as he
          approaches his car. The engine is idling... and someone else
          is behind the wheel... but through the tinted windows it is
          unclear who is driving.

                         NORMA
          You said before that the box is re-
          programmed...

                         ARLINGTON
          Yes.

                         NORMA
          So now what? Are you gonna go and
          make the offer to someone else?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         ARLINGTON
          Why yes. That-'s how it works, Mrs.
          Lewis.

                         (BEAT)
          And I can promise you that the
          offer will be made... to someone
          you do not know.
          He smiles... opens the door... and steps into the passenger
          side. The driver hits the gas and the car speeds off.
          Arthur moves out into the street... watching the car go...

                         ARTHUR
          I got his license plate.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur comes into the kitchen and goes to the desk and grabs
          a PENCIL. He then scrawls the LICENSE PLATE NUMBER down on a
          piece of scratch paper.

          Arthur paces around... thinking. He then opens the briefcase
          and starts counting through the money.

                         ARTHUR
          Did he mean that we're next? Is
          that what he meant?

          He just seemed real suspicious and
          Arthur got the license plate and I
          need you to run it.

          We ran those plates for you, sarge.
          Jim takes the document from him. It is a blow-up of a

          spines of various books until it arrives at the one with the
          call number: F2988.34
          Norma removes a BOOK from the shelf and looks at the cover:

          She begins to thumb through the pages of the play.

          Never read it.

                         NORMA
          It's a play... I read it in high

          They've quickly discover that
          they've all been sent to hell.
          Norma turns back to the inside cover of the book.

          Norma runs her hand down the list of names on the library

          Wendell James approaches... carrying a FILE under his arm.

                         WENDELL
          Bevilacqua...
          Bevilacqua turns to face him.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Wendell.
          They hug one another.

          INT. RICHMOND BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

          The two men are now sitting across from one another in a
          BOOTH. Wendell has a NASA BLUE-PRINT laid out on the table.
          The blue-print is of the button unit.

                         BEVILACQUA
          You designed it?

                         WENDELL
          Yeah. Cahill told me to...

          Bevilacaua notices a SMALL PURPLE STAIN on the blue-print.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- [FLASHBACK]

          Cahill stands over Wendell's shoulder as he sits at a
          DRAFTING TABLE in the laboratory.

                         WENDELL
          This what you were looking for,
          sir?
          Cahill looks stares at the blue-print... possessed. A DROP OF
          BLOOD falls from his right nostril and lands on it.

                         CAHILL
          Yes. Thank you Wendell.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN HANGAR -- DAY

          The CAMERA moves through the MASSIVE MAIN HANGAR at Langley.
          There are several planes parked inside. Wendell emerges from
          behind one of the planes... watching from a hidden vantage
          point...
          Cahill stands at a work table with Arlington. There are THREE
          BUTTON UNITS laid out on the table. Arlington begins to place
          them inside a leather bag.
          Cahill then hands Arlington a FILE.

                         CAHILL
          You're not gonna hurt these boys,
          are you?

                         ARLINGTON
          Any harm that comes to them will be
          their own doing.
          Arlington takes the bag and moves toward the hangar entrance.

          EXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN HANGAR -- NEXT

          Outside... there is a MASSIVE CEMENT RUNWAY. Parked on the
          runway is Arlington's car. BUD WALL steps out and opens the
          door for his boss. Bus-Driver Bud is Steward's driver...
          Arlington steps inside.
          Wendell watches them drive off...

          INT. RICHMOND DIVE BAR -- EVENING

          Wendell then hands a file to Bevilacqua. Inside there is a
          dossier and photo of a ARTHUR LEWIS. He flips to another
          dossier and photo of another NASA EMPLOYEE named KENNETH

          WELLER.

                         WENDELL
          There's a list... and they've all
          got a wife and one child.
          Bevilacqua thumbs through the list of NASA dossiers. He sees
          Arthur Lewis among them.

                         WENDELL (CONT'D)
          Did you kill your wife?
          Bevilacqua just stares at him... on the verge of tears. He
          slides an ENVELOPE across the table.

                         BEVILACQUA
          This is a confession letter that I
          wrote... it explains everything
          that happened with Steward and the
          box. Keep it... cause if I don't
          make it... this might clear my name
          one day.
          Bevilacqua looks at the KENNETH WELLER dossier.

                         BEVILACQUA (CONT'D)
          This guy Weller is gonna be next.
          Did you get their phone number?

                         WENDELL
          No. They're not listed. Just an old
          address south of Petersburg. What
          are you gonna do?

                         BEVILACQUA
          I don't know. I need a car. I might
          be able to save them... and this
          guy Arthur Lewis...
          Wendell thinks to himself... then retrieves a set of KEYS
          from his pocket.

                         WENDELL
          These are the keys to my cousin's
          pick-up truck. It's not registered.
          It's parked in front of my house
          over on Byrd street. Take it...

                         BEVILACQUA
          Thank you, Wendell.

          STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
          Just then... his RECEPTIONIST opens the door to his office.

                         RECEPTIONIST

          He hangs up the phone and looks through the glass window of
          his office into the reception area.
          Standing there through the glass... is a man who looks
          identical to Arlington Steward.
          He stands with the normal side of his face in profile. He
          turns to face Jim... but his face now appears as it did
          before he was burned. Is this the same person?
          Jim turns to his receptionist... who waits in the doorway

                         JIM (CONT'D)
          Send him in.

          The library is closing down for the night.
          A group of young CHILDREN come out of the front exit. One of
          them turns and notices the OWL perched on the railing.
          The owl stares at the children...

          desk.
          He stands in profile... then turns toward the CAMERA in the
          same manner as his TWIN in the police station. His burned
          face forms a deformed smile...

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- BURNS'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          The STEWARD TWIN steps into Jim's office. He reaches out and

          Yes. Apparently he made an
          appearance at my daughter's house.
          Your brother works for NASA?

          And may I ask... what do you do,
          Mr. Steward?

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NEXT

          With his eyes closed... Arlington reaches into his pocket and
          retrieves something imaginary from his pocket. He raises
          something that we cannot see up into the air.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- BURNS'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          Reston is now holding out a GOVERNMENT BADGE with his right

          Robert Bevilacqua. He is very

          opens his eyes.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- RECEPTION AREA -- NEXT

          Reston opens his eyes... as if a spirit has suddenly left his

          thigh. He asked me what happened...
          and I felt this sense of dread.

                         ARLINGTON
          Why?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         NORMA
          Because you can just see the glow
          disappear in someone's eyes when
          they discover something about you
          that they just can't stomach.

                         ARLINGTON
          Did the glow disappear from his
          eyes?

                         NORMA
          No. Not Arthur. He was different
          than the others. He... said that...
          my scars were cool.

                         (BEAT)
          He said that they made me more
          attractive.

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur sits across from Elizabeth. His mind is racing...
          trying to put the puzzle pieces together.
          He looks at his watch. It is almost 5PM.

                          ELIZABETH
           I have worked at this library for
          forty years. Since 1936, I have
          read a book a day. 23455 books I
          have read.

                         ARTHUR
          Wow.

                         (BEAT)
          Someone should nominate you for
          librarian of the year.
          She holds the copy of No Exit in her hands.

                         ELIZABETH
          Of all of the books I have read in
          my lifetime... this is my son's
          favorite.

                         (BEAT)
          Have you ever read No Exit?

                         ARTHUR
          No.
          She reaches out with her hand.

                         ELIZABETH
          Take my hand... and I'll show you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          He stares at the blood coagulating in the bag beneath her
          left eye.

                         ARTHUR
          I'm not gonna touch you, lady.

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- PERIODICALS SECTION -- NEXT

          Arlington now stares directly into Norma's soul.
          The scar tissue on the left side of his face does not move
          when he smiles. It remains frozen... unable to express
          emotion.

                         ARLINGTON
          And what emotion did you feel when
          you first laid eyes upon me, Norma?
          She thinks silently for a moment.

                         NORMA
          I felt.. .
          She stops herself... afraid of how he might respond if she is
          honest with him.

                         ARLINGTON
          You felt what?

                         NORMA
          I felt...

                         ARLINGTON
          Pity?

                         NORMA
          Love.

                         ARLINGTON
          You felt love for me?

                         NORMA
          Yes.

                         ARLINGTON
          Why?

                         NORMA
          Because of my foot. Because of my
          disfigurement. I thought of all the
          pain I've felt in my life because
          of it... the physical pain... the
          emotional pain.

          73.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          I thought about what it would be
          like to have that pain magnified
          and projected onto my face... onto
          a part of my body that I can't hide
          with a shoe.
          There are tears welling in her eyes.

          NORMA (CONT`D)
          I saw all of that pain in your face
          and I understood it... and I felt
          an overwhelming feeling of love for
          you because I knew I'd never feel
          sorry for myself or my goddamn foot
          ever again.

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- NEXT

          Elizabeth continues to hold her hand out toward Arthur.

                         ELIZABETH
          Take my hand, son.

                         ARTHUR
          You called me a cuckold. You made a
          statement... made an implication to
          me that my wife was going to be
          killed.

                         (BEAT)
          So please understand why I might be
          reluctant to take your hand.

          Arlington reaches his hand out to Norma.

                         ARLINGTON
          Take my hand, Norma...
          She stares at him, unable to move... then takes his hand...

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- NEXT

          Elizabeth reaches out and grabs Arthur's hand against his
          will. His body convulses at her touch...
          The CAMERA drifts in toward Arthur's face as his eyes slowly
          close. Her spell has been cast upon him...

          CUT TO BLACK:

          SILENCE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          INT. DREAM -- CORRIDOR -- NEXT

          The CAMERA moves slowly down a CORRIDOR. The floor is shiny
          white marble and the walls are framed by ornate molding and

          RENAISSANCE ART.
          Arlington stands at the end of the corridor. He is wearing a
          TUXEDO, portraying the VALET character from Sartre's No Exit.
          The CAMERA pans around to reveal Arthur... walking slowly
          down the corridor.
          Arlington opens a DOOR at the end of the corridor and leads
          Arthur into a DRAWING ROOM... recreated from Sartre's play.

          INT. DREAM -- DRAWING ROOM -- NEXT

          Arlington leads Arthur inside and closes the door behind him.
          Inside the DRAWING ROOM, there are THREE COUCHES made in the
          style.: of the SECOND EMPIRE. The walls are covered in similar
          Renaissance art and the floor is marble.
          NORMA and WALTER have now been admitted to the drawing room.
          Norma is dressed in an elegant BLACK GOWN. Walter wears a
          tuxedo that looks to be nearly identical to the one his
          father is wearing... and THERE IS A SILK BLINDFOLD WRAPPED
          AROUND HIS HEAD. He wanders around the room... lost...
          The dimensions of the room are equal in every way. It is a
          perfect three-dimensional box.
          Arthur then looks to his wife. He notices that her EYELIDS
          are now gone. Arthur then turns to his son.
          Walter reaches out into the air... seemingly unaware that
          they are in, the room with him.
          The CAMERA moves through the wall into another corridor...
          BUD WALL... dressed as another VALET, passes by... and the
          CAMERA moves into another DRAWING ROOM...

          INT. DREAM -- SECOND DRAWING ROOM -- NEXT

          Inside the SECOND DRAWING ROOM... the CAMERA finds ROBERT
          BEVILACQUA and his WIFE. Their DAUGHTER is wearing a SILK

          BLINDFOLD.
          The CAMERA then drifts up and moves through the GLASS PANELS
          at the top of the room...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

          INT. DREAM -- UPPER LEVEL -- NEXT

          The CAMERA pulls up higher... revealing the layout of a
          massive network of CORRIDORS and DRAWING ROOMS that form a
          larger box. Through the glass ceilings looking down into each
          room... FAMILIES are assembled together... trapped
          together... forever...

          EXT. MARS SURFACE -- NEXT

          The CAMERA flies over the edge of the SARTRE'S HOTEL of rooms
          and corridors to reveal the plateau of UTOPIA PLANITIA on the
          surface of mars...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- LATER ON

          Arthur's eyes pop open... he rolls over... and Norma is
          asleep in bed next to him. They are both fully dressed in the
          clothes they were wearing in the library.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma...
          Her eyes open. She looks around... disoriented.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Norma... what happened?

                         NORMA
          I don't know.
          Norma notices Walter standing in the doorway.

                         WALTER
          You came home an hour ago.

                         NORMA
          We did?
          She sits up in bed... looking at the clock radio. It is 6PM.

                         WALTER
          Neither of you said a word... you
          just walked into the house like two
          zombies. Went straight to bed.
          Arthur and Norma stare at one another, trying to make sense
          of what has just transpired.

                         NORMA
          The wedding. It starts in an hour.
          We've got to get ready.

          Norma sees that the copy of No Exit is now sitting on --heir
          bedside table.

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. -- NIGHT

          A U.S. ARMY JET flies over the nation's capital. The PENTAGON
          and the WASHINGTON MONUMENT are visible below.

          INT. U.S. ARMY JET -- NEXT

           The CAMERA approaches US ARMY GENERAL NATHAN TEAGUE ( 50s),
          seated just behind the cockpit.
          In his lap is a file. He is thumbing through a series of
          photographs of the MARS SURFACE. He then arrives at a stack
          of paperwork. There is a photograph of ARTHUR LEWIS at the
          top of the stack.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BATHROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma, now wearing her BRIDESMAID DRESS, puts a DIAMOND
          EARRING in her right lobe. She turns to the mirror and jumps
          in her skin... as the face staring back at her has no
          eyelids.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- WALTER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur sits on the end of Walter's bed. Walters stands in
          front of him as his father ties his NECK TIE in front of a
          standing mirror.

                         WALTER
          What's going on?

                         ARTHUR
          I don't know.

                         WALTER
          This is about the box... isn't it?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         WALTER
          Did you push the button?

                         ARTHUR
          Your mother did.

                         WALTER
          What happens when you push the
          button?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         ARTHUR
          I don't know.

                         WALTER
          Yes you do. You're just not telling
          me.
          Arthur finishes with his tie. He notices something on the
          floor of his son's bedroom. It is the MARS COMIC BOOK.
          He picks it up and stares at the dark figure looming on the
          cover.

                         ARTHUR
          Where did you get this?

                         WALTER
          Dana. She gave it to me.
          Arthur begins to page through the comic book.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- ROOF TOP -- NEXT

          Arlington kneels at the edge of the MOTEL SWIMMING POOL. He
          runs his hand through the water. Steam is rising from the
          surface.
          STROBES OF WHITE LIGHT begin flicker from beneath the
          surface... as though some unseen SOURCE OF ENERGY is
          emanating from down below.
          Arlington slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington approaches the BLACK SEDAN idling in the car port.
          He gets inside... and Bud drives off.

          INT. SCOPE INSERT -- NIGHT

          The CAMERA looks through a TELESCOPE LENS of some sort from
          high on a ROOFTOP in downtown Richmond.
          It scans across several CARS passing down the street...
          PEDESTRIANS on the sidewalk... landing on ARLINGTON and BUD
          as they move toward the entrance of a STONE FRONT BUILDING.

          EXT. RICHMOND ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          We see that a SNIPER, dressed in a dark suit, is perched on
          the roof of an adjacent building. He has an earpiece in his
          left ear.

          Alright... they are entering the
          building from the south entrance on
          fourteenth street.

          INT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington and Bud move down the main corridor of the GENERAL
          ASSEMBLY BUILDING, approaching a bank of ELEVATORS. A
          SECURITY GUARD nods to them nervously.
          Arlington nods back.

          INT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington and Bud emerge from the elevators on the THIRD
          FLOOR and move down the hall. As they pass into a RECEPTION
          AREA, the CAMERA moves toward a GLASS PARTITION with the
          VIRGINIA STATE EMBLEM etched into the glass.
          Below it is a name:

          HOUSE OF DELEGATES

          GRIFFITH POWELL - MAJORITY LEADER

           INT. GRIFFITH POWELL'S OFFICE -- RECEPTION -- NEXT

           As they approach the RECEPTION AREA... the FEMALE
          RECEPTIONIST ( 30s) stands up anxiously behind her desk.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Excuse me... may I help you?

                         ARLINGTON
          Where is he?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Uhhh... he's in a meeting.

                         ARLINGTON
          I need to see him... now.

          INT. GRIFFITH POWELL'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          The RECEPTIONIST comes into the office. Griffith Powell
          stands at the window behind his desk... smoking a cigarette.
          He is dressed in a TUXEDO with his jacket hanging next to his
          desk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          He's here... I don't know what to
          do.
          Powell turns to face her.

                         POWELL
          Let him in.
          The Receptionist goes back out... and within moments...
          Arlington and Bud enter the office. The Receptionist closes
          the door and leaves them alone.

                         ARLINGTON
          Hello Senator.

                         POWELL

                         (TERRIFIED)
          Mr. Steward... it's good to see
          you.

                         ARLINGTON
          Call me Arlington.

                         POWELL
          Okay... Arlington.
          Bud just stares at the Senator... showing no sign of emotion.

                         ARLINGTON
          Do you have my money?

                         POWELL
          I've given you four-hundred
          thousand already. How much more are
          you going to need?

                         ARLINGTON
          As much as it takes.
          Powell sighs out loud... irritated.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          First the nose...
          Powell turns around and there is now BLOOD GUSHING from his
          nose...

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Then the ears...
          BLOOD begins to ooze from both ears... as he covers his
          face... feeling the warm fluid rush from every orifice...

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Then the eyes...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          Blood rushes from beneath his eyelids... his entire face
          covered in BLOOD... his WHITE SHIRT DRENCHED...

                         POWELL
          Please! I've got it right here!
          Powell reaches beneath his desk and retrieves a large
          briefcase. He places it on the desk.

                         POWELL (CONT'D)
          It's all there! Two-hundred
          thousand! You can count it if you
          want!

                         ARLINGTON
          Bud...
          Bud grabs the briefcase from the desk and pops it open. He
          sees that it is filled with stacks of cash.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          You tell that sniper you have
          perched on that roof next door that
          I can smell his cheap cologne.

          EXT. RICHMOND ROOFTOP -- NEXT

           The SNIPER hears Arlington's VOICE in his earpiece.

                          ARLINGTON (EARPIECE)
          I think it might be Old Spice.
          The Sniper smells his shoulder.

          INT. POWELL'S OFFICE -- RECEPTION -- NEXT

          Arlington and Bud move through the reception area. The
          Receptionist lurks behind her desk... frightened.

          INT. FOREST LAWN BABTIST CHURCH -- NIGHT

          Arthur and Norma are standing in a WAITING ROOM in the church
          where her sister is about to be married. BRIDESMAIDS and
          GROOMSMEN are chatting with one another in anticipation of
          the ceremony.
          Norma clutches the copy of No Exit.

                         ARTHUR
          You and Walter were there in the
          room. You were wearing a black
          dress, identical to the one you
          have on now.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Walter had a blindfold on.

                         (BEAT)
          And then your eyes...

                         NORMA
          They didn't have lids...

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         NORMA
          I had the same dream.
          Arthur's mind is racing... he glances through the crowd
          nervously, afraid that they are being watched.

                         ARTHUR
          What's the last thing you remember?

                         NORMA
          The library. He was asking me all
          of these questions... about you...
          about our marriage.

                         (BEAT)
          Then I took his hand...
          Susan approaches...

                         SUSAN
          Alright girls... time to line up!
          Susan hands Arthur the book and goes off with the other

          BRIDESMAIDS.

          INT. FOREST LAWN BABTIST CHURCH -- NIGHT

          Norma stands next to Deborah as she is about to take her
          vows.

                         PREACHER
          Do you, Deborah Burns, take Edward
          Powell, to be your'-lawfully wedded
          husband, 'til death do you part?

                         DEBORAH
          I do.
          Norma looks over to Arthur, as he sits in the congregation.
          He is not paying attention to the wedding. He is reading
          Sartre's play...
          The CAMERA zooms into a close-up of the page describing the
          final scene in the play No Exit:

                         CURTAIN

          EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

          The WEDDING PARTY comes pouring out of the church. There is a
          massive LAWN south of the entrance. During the holidays it is
          filled with CHRISTMAS TREES for sale, and dozens of ARTS &
          CRAFTS BOOTHS assembled in rows.
          The CAMERA moves through the crowd to find Norma posing for
          photos with her fellow bridesmaids out in front of the
          square.
          ACROSS THE SQUARE... Bud Wall lurks within the rows of
          Christmas Trees. He spies Arthur and Walter mingling with his
          parents and Senator Powell, who has TWO SECRET SERVICEMEN
          standing close by.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- LATER ON

          The CAMERA approaches the driveway of the VIRGINIA HOUSE...
          which is positioned at the south end of Forest Lawn square.
          Wedding guests are arriving in droves.
          The house is a large GOTHIC MANSION that is often rented out
          for public events... and in this case... for the lavish
          WEDDING RECEPTION of Deborah Burns and Edward Powell.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK LAWN -- LATER ON

          Arthur and Norma move through the courtyard into the wedding
          reception area... which flows through several TENTS that have
          been erected with HEAT LAMPS and tables covered in WHITE
          TABLECLOTHS and FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS.
          Arthur carries the copy of No Exit with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         ARTHUR
          The play tells the story of uhree
          people, condemned to hell. They are
          to remain in a second empire
          drawing room for all of eternity.
          He closes the book... his mind dissecting what he has just
          read.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          They soon discover that their
          eyelids are missing... and for all
          eternity they will be unable to
          sleep.
          Norma remembers most of the play from high school.

                         NORMA
          There are no mirrors... so they
          will never be able to see their own
          reflection... but only the faces of
          their tormentors.

                         ARTHUR
          This is Sartre's vision of hell.

                         NORMA
          Because Hell... is other people.
          The look into one another's eyes... Norma sees a WAITER pass
          by with a tray of CHAMPAGNE. They both take a glass.
          Jim crosses the lawn to greet them.

                         JIM
          Arthur... can I speak with you
          privately for a moment?

                         ARTHUR
          Sure.
          Arthur walks away with Jim toward the edge of a PATIO that
          overlooks the whole party.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- UPPER PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER

          Jim and Arthur stand at a table. Jim has several PHOTOGRAPHS
          laid out on the table. They are mostly family photos taken
          from the house of Robert Bevilacqua.

                         JIM
          And do you know this fella? Robert
          Bevilacqua?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah... I know him. He works at

          NASA.

                         JIM
          Do you know his wife?

                         ARTHUR
          No...

                         JIM
          Well... he shot and killed his wife
          yesterday morning.

                         ARTHUR
          No...

                         JIM
          Yeah... He shot her point blank in
          the chest in his kitchen.
          Arthur takes a deep breath. He isn't feeling well.

                         JIM (CONT'D)
          This Bevilacqua fella... if he
          tries to contact you or Norma...
          you have to call me immediately,
          you understand?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah. Of course.
          Arthur looks down at the lawn. Norma is staring back at them.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK LAWN -- LATER ON

          Norma is now standing up on stage with a MICROPHONE in her
          hand..,. giving her MAID OF HONOR speech.

                         NORMA
          My little sister once asked me...
          what's the best thing about being
          married?
          Norma looks across the lawn to the table where Arthur is
          seated, next to Walter and their parents.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          I told her that... it's knowing
          that for the rest of your life
          you'll never feel alone.

                         (BEAT)
          Not ever again.
          She smiles at her husband.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          That is... until you get divorced.
          There is laughter from the crowd. Deborah blushes... leaning
          her head on her new husband's shoulder.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Or... until he decides to kill you.
          More laughter.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DANCE FLOOR -- LATER

          Arthur and Norma are now slow dancing.

                         ARTHUR
          Why did you say that?

                         NORMA
          Say what?

                         ARTHUR
          In your speech. That joke about me
          killing you.

                         NORMA
          I don't know... I thought it was
          funny. Guess I've had too much
          champagne.

                         ARTHUR
          Did your dad tell you about Robert
          Bevilacqua?

                         NORMA
          No.

                         ARTHUR
          He shot his wife yesterday morning.
          Did you know his wife?

                         NORMA
          No.
          Norma is still searching for some other explanation.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          What if it's all a test for the
          aspiring astronauts?

                         ARTHUR
          What do you mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         NORMA
          A psychological test. They want to
          see how you'll respond to a moral
          dilemma... the fate of a human
          life... determined by the push of a
          single button. Think of the men on
          the Apollo thirteen mission...
          sound familiar?
          They turn slowly on the dance floor...
          Arthur closes his eyes... his mind racing...
          A VOICE breaks through the music...

          VOICE (O.S.)
          May I cut in?
          Arthur and Norma turn to see a MAN standing there...
          It is DR. EARL STUPE.

                         STUPE
          I would like to dance with your
          wife. Do you mind?
          Arthur glares at Dr. Stupe.

                         NORMA
          It's okay Arthur...
          Arthur looks at him... then back at Norma. His face has gone
          pale and he looks for a moment as though he might faint on
          the dance floor.

                         ARTHUR

          I.. I.

                         (SWALLOWS HARD)
          Will you please excuse me?
          Arthur moves toward the stairs that lead up to the palatial
          estate. Walter is there... waiting.

                         WALTER
          Dad! What's going on?

                         ARTHUR
          I.. I'm gonna be sick Walter...
          He places his hand on his son's head for a brief moment and
          then stumbles up the stairs.
          ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Norma is now slow dancing with Dr.
          Stupe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         STUPE
          I know what they call me. Dr.
          Stupid. My patients... the ones who
          will still see me... they find out
          what I did and they stop calling.

                         NORMA
          I'm sorry for that. I can't control
          what people say.

                         STUPE
          I am Dr. Stupid now. Someone wrote
          it on my windshield with soap once.
          I figure it must have been a
          relative... a friend of yours.

                         (BEAT)
          Oh... how they love you, Norma
          Lewis. And they love your
          husband... the one who saved you.
          Did he save your life? Did he
          rescue you from the oblivion that I
          manufactured?

                         NORMA
          Yes. You have my forgiveness, Earl.
          People make mistakes... and if they
          seek forgiveness... they should be
          forgiven.

                         (BEAT)
          That's the rule of my lord.

          INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur comes into the MEN'S BATHROOM and rushes into one of
          the stalls. He falls to his knees... leaning over the toilet.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DANCE FLOOR -- LATER

          ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Norma notices her brother NATHAN...
          sitting alone at his table in his wheelchair. He is drunk...
          lost in his own sadness. He smiles at her...

                         STUPE
          There is that old cliche... that
          the lord works in mysterious ways.
          Well... I have met the lord. I have
          spoken to him in my dreams. And it
          brought me back to that day in my
          office when you arrived with a
          fractured foot... some thirteen
          years ago.

                         (BEAT)
          He told me that it was essential...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         STUPE (CONT'D)
          an essential event in the cycle of
          purgatory and its inevitable
          conclusion.
          Norma pulls away from him. Blood drains out of his nose...

                         STUPE (CONT'D)
          For when the cycle of purgatory
          concludes... there is nothing left
          but a barren wasteland of rock and
          sand... a deafening wind and a
          cold, dry winter.
          ABOVE... on the MARBLE RAILING... the OWL is perched on the
          ledge... watching...
          ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Stupe retrieves a PISTOL from his
          pocket... and raises his eyes to meet those of his dance
          partner.

                         STUPE (CONT'D)
          I am sorry my dear...
          Stupe takes the pistol... places it against his temple... and
          pulls the trigger.
          BLOOD SPRAYS across the dance floor... some of it on Norma's
          face. PEOPLE BEGIN TO SCREAM AND THE ENTIRE WEDDING ERUPTS

          INTO CHAOS...

          INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur is now standing at the urinal. He begins to hear
          commotion outside. He turns his head to the left... when
          something COLD and METAL locks itself around his wrist.
          Arthur turns back to the right and sees that it is Robert
          Bevilacqua. He is standing at the urinal next to him and they
          are now HAND-CUFFED TOGETHER at the wrists.
          Bevilacqua retrieves a GUN from his pocket at points it at
          Arthur. He has dark circles under his eyes.

                         BEVILACQUA
          You can still save yourself. It's
          too late for me... but you can
          still save yourself.

                         ARTHUR
          Bevilacqua...

                         BEVILACQUA
          Follow me out through the kitchen.
          I have a truck waiting...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK CORRIDOR -- NEXT

          Arthur and Bevilacqua emerge from the men's bathroom into a
          hallway that leads into the kitchen. Beyond them... in th.e
          PARLOR... there is commotion among the members of the wedding
          party in response to the gunshot.

          INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur and Bevilacqua move through the kitchen. The WAITERS
          and WAITRESSES are all distracted by the commotion and barely
          take notice of them as they pass through...

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Walter walks down the driveway as several POLICE OFFICERS
          rush past him, moving toward the entrance of the house. The
          whole place is being evacuated...
          He looks toward the square... and begins to move in that
          direction.
          The CAMERA drifts back toward the ROCK PILLAR that stands at
          the entrance to the house. Arlington is standing there in
          front of it. He is wearing his black hat... pulled down low.
          He begins to follow Walter toward the square...

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK DRIVEWAY -- NEXT

          Arthur and Bevilacqua come out the back entrance into the
          driveway. There is a WHITE PICKUP TRUCK parked there.
          Bevilacqua opens the passenger side door and the two of them
          slide across the seat, Bevilacqua behind the wheel.

          EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Walter wanders through a group of CHRISTMAS CAROLERS...
          moving toward the maze of CHRISTMAS TREES. He looks over his
          shoulder... where Arlington emerges from a crowd... staring
          him down like a monster.
          Walter's face is ghost white with terror. He begins to walk
          faster through the maze.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma comes down the driveway with her mother and sister...
          overcome with shock... searching the crowd...

                         NORMA
          Walter?

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK DRIVEWAY -- NEXT

          Bevilacqua puts the truck into drive and speeds out of the
          driveway onto the street.
          Jim stands across the lawn, manning the chaos. He recognizes
          the two men as the pass him by... and he raises his WALKIE-
          TALKIE to his mouth.

                         JIM
          I just spotted Bevilacqua... he's
          in a white pick-up truck. Potential
          hostage situation.

          EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Walter winds his way through the maze of Christmas trees...
          rounding a corner... where he runs into DANA.

                         DANA
          Walter...

                         WALTER
          Hey.
          Bud arrives next to her.

                         DANA
          Is everything alright?

                         WALTER
          No.

                         DANA
          Come with us.
          She takes his hand and they move north back toward the
          church.

          EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT

          The WHITE PICK-UP drives south down 1-95.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT

          Bevilacqua has his hands on the steering wheel... Arthur's
          left arm extended due to the hand-cuffing.

                         BEVILACQUA

                         (DELIRIOUS)
          Did you push the button... or was
          it your wife?

                         ARTHUR
          My wife.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Yeah... me too. I wasn't even home.
          She decided to push it when I
          wasn't around to stop her.

                         ARTHUR
          And now she's dead. Did you kill
          her?

                         BEVILACQUA
          I don't want to talk about it.

                         ARTHUR
          Where are you taking me?
          Bevilacqua retrieves a NASA DOSSIER from the dashboard and
          hands it to Arthur.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Kenneth Weller. You know him?

                         ARTHUR
          Name sounds familiar. Does he work
          at Langley too?

                         BEVILACQUA
          Yep. He's next. Him and his wife...
          they've got the box now.
          Suddenly... BLUE AND RED LIGHTS appear behind them...
          followed by the sound of a SIREN.

          EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT

          TWO POLICE CRUISERS are now tailing the pick-up truck.

          INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT

          Bevilacqua steps on the gas... accelerating to outrun them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         ARTHUR
          What are you doing?

                         BEVILACQUA
          I'm not gonna let them get me...
          Arthur... we've got to get to
          Kenneth Weller. We've got to break
          the chain... or your wife is gonna
          die!

                         ARTHUR
          How is she going to die?

                         BEVILACQUA
          You're going to kill her!
          Bevilacqua swerves into the ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE to pass a
          car in front of them. A LARGE 18-WHEELER TRUCK is barreling
          toward them.
          Bevilacqua pulls the truck back into the right lane.

          EXT. 1-95 -- NEXT

          The 18 WHEELER slams on the brakes... then jack-knives to
          the left... blocking both lanes...
          One of the POLICE CRUISERS pulls off into the ditch... while
          the second CRUISER swerves and SMASHES head on into the side
          of the truck bed... sheering the top of the sedan into two
          pieces...

          INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT

          Arthur looks back over his shoulder... seeing the cars smash
          together.

                         ARTHUR
          Jesus! You're gonna get us killed!

                         BEVILACQUA
          Did Steward take you to the
          library? Did you meet his mother...
          the librarian?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Did she tell you about Prometheus?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Steward has a twin brother... and
          he works for the CIA.
          UP AHEAD... Arthur sees FOUR MORE POLICE CRUISERS with their
          lights flashing. They have formed a ROADBLOCK.
          Bevilacqua lowers his foot onto the accelerator... refusing
          to back down.

                         BEVILACQUA (CONT'D)
          This is purgatory... we're living
          in purgatory...

          EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT

          The WHITE TRUCK smashes through the line of POLICE CRUISERS
          as POLICE OFFICERS dive for cover.
          An officer raises his GUN and fires off several rounds toward
          the truck.
          A BULLET explodes the right front tire...
          The truck swerves and FLIPS OVER onto one side... tumbling
          over and over along the interstate in a horrific crash.
          ONCOMING CARS swerve into ditches... and the white truck
          comes sliding to a stop on the wet pavement.
          The CAMERA slowly approaches the smoking wreckage... catching
          a glimpse of Bevilacqua... his face covered in blood. Arthur
          remains hidden from sight.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma rushes down the sidewalk on the perimeter of the
          square... searching for her son.

                         NORMA
          Walter?
          A BLACK SEDAN pulls up next to her... and Reston steps out of
          the car.
          Norma locks eyes with him... recognizing his face...

                         RESTON
          Mrs. Lewis? Norma Lewis?

                         NORMA
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         RESTON
          My name is Reston Steward. I work
          for the CIA.

                         NORMA
          Yeah? Where is my son? Where is my
          husband?

                         RESTON
          Please... get into the car.
          Norma stares at him in disbelief... as he opens the back door
          and gestures inside.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)

                         (GENTLE)
          Please... there isn't much time.

          EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT -- LATER ON

          Jim Burns walks through the aftermath of the crash site.
          There are now several FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCES and other
          EMERGENCY VEHICLES scattered on either side of the
          interstate.
          Robert Bevilacqua's DEAD BODY is now on a stretcher. Jim
          looks down at him briefly... then turns to another OFFICER on
          the scene.

                         JIM
          Where's Arthur?

                         OFFICER #1
          They took him away in an ambulance.

          INT. AMBULANCE -- NEXT

          Arthur sits up in the back of the ambulance. He has a small
          scrape on his cheekbone... but otherwise appears unharmed.
          An EMS TECHNICIAN is in there with him. He hands Arthur an

          ICE PACK.

                         EMS TECHNICIAN
          Here... hold this against your
          forehead. It'll keep your head from
          swelling.
          Arthur takes the ice pack and places it against his head.

                         ARTHUR
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         EMS TECHNICIAN
          I think it might have been a
          miracle.
          The EMS Technician shakes his head in disbelief.

                         ARTHUR
          What?

                         EMS TECHNICIAN
          That car accident. I've never seen
          someone walk away from an accident
          like that.

                         (BEAT)
          Somebody upstairs is looking out
          for you, buddy.
          The door to the ambulance opens. A US ARMY OFFICER appears.
          He steps away from the doors and General Teague emerges from
          the darkness.

                         TEAGUE
          Are you able to walk, son?

                         ARTHUR
          Yes, sir.

                         TEAGUE
          Please step out of the ambulance.

          EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT

          Arthur steps out of the ambulance and sees that it is parked
          in front of a HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL on an exit of 1-95. The
          hotel has a DINER attached to it.
          There are more than a dozen POLICE CARS parked in front,
          along with..several BLACK SEDANS and MILITARY VEHICLES.
          Arthur hears the rumble of a HELICOPTER circling the sky
          above them. Its SEARCHLIGHT sweeps through the forest.
          In front of the diner entrance... more than a DOZEN MEN
          operate VIDEO CAMERAS and STILL CAMERAS mounted on tripods,
          all pointed toward the front window of the diner.
          Teague is standing with Cahill and Reston, along with several
          other MILITARY PERSONNEL.
          Arthur notices Norma as she emerges from a BLACK SEDAN... she
          looks exhausted... delirious.

                         NORMA
          Arthur!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma!
          She hugs him... neither has slept in two days.

                         NORMA
          Where's Walter?

                         ARTHUR
          I don't know.
          Reston steps forward.

                         RESTON
          My brother has taken your son...
          but he assures me that he is alive
          and well.
          Reston tries to comfort them with a smile.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)
          Take a walk with us.
          Norma and Arthur begin to walk with Reston, Teague and Cahill
          toward the diner entrance.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)
          Are you familiar with the myth of
          Prometheus?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         RESTON
          In the 1940s... when NASA was
          formed, we began developing, in
          secret, a project that we dubbed
          the Prometheus Effect.

                         TEAGUE
          Projecting fictional scenarios
          about how we would respond, if and
          when we came into contact with an
          alien intelligence.

                         RESTON
          If the intelligence had hostile
          intent... or if it began to somehow
          display proof of its ability to
          destroy us, we would have a system
          in place to begin negotiating with
          it in secret.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         TEAGUE
          The goal of Prometheus is to
          maintain coexistence with this life-
          form, and eventually achieve peace
          with it, so that its power can be
          harnessed, developed and applied in
          such a manner that will benefit the
          human race.
          Arthur notices that Cahill is holding a folder in his right
          hand.

                         CAHILL
          On the night of September 3rd, as
          the server was downloading images
          from the Viking camera system that
          you helped design... we experienced
          an electrical surge from a bolt of
          lightning.
          As they arrive at the entrance to the diner, Cahill shows
          Arthur a blurry black and white photograph.

                         CAHILL (CONT'D)
          An anomaly in the series of Viking
          images produced this photograph of
          the Mars surface.
          The photo appears to be a ghost-like TRAIL OF WHITE LIGHT
          streaking across the martian landscape.
          Teague nods toward the diner window.

                         TEAGUE
          According to... it... and whatever
          it is...
          Arthur notices Arlington sitting alone in a booth inside the
          diner... waiting...

                         TEAGUE (CONT'D)
          A ghost... an apparition... a
          methane compound imbedded in pulse
          of electricity...

                         CAHILL
          If the human spirit is assigned a
          specific bandwidth upon
          conception... twins... would
          provide it with a dual bandwidth
          carrier...

                         RESTON

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          It claims to be more than six
          billion years old.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         J
          Arthur stares at the streak of white light in the photo.

                         ARTHUR
          My camera... took this photo...

                         CAHILL
          We've run the data sequence off the
          server more than a thousand times.
          Each time... this one photo in the
          sequence comes out of the dark room
          just like this. We can't explain
          why.
          Arthur hands the photo back to Cahill.

                         NORMA
          What does it want?
          Cahill glances at Teague... who looks to Cahill.

                         CAHILL
          I think the same thing that it
          wanted from Bevilacqua... except
          that poor boy is no longer around
          to tell us why he shot his wife.

                         NORMA
          What did he say to you when you
          were in the car with him?

                         ARTHUR
          Something about breaking the chain.
          He wanted to find the next test
          subject... and prevent them from
          pushing the button.
          Cahill is writing diligently on his NOTE PAD.
          Reston can now feel something taking control of him... he
          looks to Teague... terrified.
          He closes his eyes... his body begins to twitch.
          Teague stares at his friend... realizing what is happening.
          Reston opens his eyes... now possessed... blood draining from
          his ears.

                         RESTON
          General Teague... it's a pleasure
          to meet you.

                         (BEAT)
          I would like to continue with my
          experiment... if you don't mind.
          Reston smiles at the General.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)
          Please do not interfere... as I
          assure you that if you do... there
          will be dire consequences...
          Reston then turns to face Arthur and Norma.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)
          Time is of the essence... and I'd
          like to invite my guests inside.
          Reston opens the door to the diner and gestures to Arthur and
          Norma for them to come inside.

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Arthur, Norma and Reston make their way down the long aisle
          of the diner, flanked by a row of booths, across from a long
          LUNCH COUNTER with a metal surface.
          Arlington sits alone in a booth. He pivots his head around to
          face them.

                         ARLINGTON
          Please have a seat.
          Reston sits down next to his twin brother... Arthur and Norma
          sit down across from the twins.
          Arlington has now locked completely into his brother's
          spirit...
          The movement of the two men is in now in PERFECT
          SYNCHRONICITY, staggered by exactly one second... Reston
          following Arlington.
          Arlington's eyes remain closed in deep concentration...
          Arlington's lips move silently... and Reston repeats them out
          loud. Reston's demeanor is now kind... gentle... almost
          apologetic for his past behavior.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          Don't be frightened by my manner of
          communication... but it is becoming
          more difficult for me to speak,
          given my body's... condition.

                         NORMA
          What have you done with our son?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          We'll get to him in a moment... but
          first I want you to know that I
          have a deep respect and admiration
          you both, and I am very sorry...
          that you pushed the button.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT

          Bud now has Walter laid out on the cement next the edge of
          the SWIMMING POOL at the shallow end. The boy is
          unconscious... still dressed in his suit from the wedding.
          From across the pool... Dana is squatting on the end of the
          DIVING BOARD... watching them.
          Bud then removes Walter's right shoe and sock... exposing his
          bare foot. He then retrieves a SERRATED HUNTING KNIFE... and
          cuts in the flesh from his BIG TOE across the ball of his
          foot... drawing blood.

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Reston closes his eyes for a moment. When he opens them...
          tears have begun to form, as though he cannot bear the news
          that his brother is forcing him to deliver.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          I will now give you a chance to
          save yourselves... an opportunity
          for redemption and salvation.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT

          Bud is now carrying the unconscious Walter in his arms. He
          steps into the shallow end of the heated pool... and dunks
          the boy under the surface.
          BLOOD from the cut on the bottom of his foot drains out into
          the water like red ink...

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Norma closes her eyes... the impending sense of dread
          building inside of her.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          Two of your son's five functional
          senses have been permanently
          impaired.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT

          UNDERWATER... Walter floats with his arms spread wide...
          WHITE STROBES OF LIGHT FLICKER AROUND HIM. The light streaks
          bear a close resemblance to the image in the -Mars photo.
          Blood streams out from his foot into the water.

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Blood is now flowing out of Reston's left nostril. Both
          Arthur and Norma recoil in horror.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          He is now blind and deaf.

                         (BEAT)
          For the rest of his life, he will
          never hear your voice... or see
          your face.

                         ARTHUR
          (under his breath)
          Why...

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          You are now presented with two
          options.

                         (BEAT)
          Option one... you enjoy the rest of
          your lives with the money you have
          been given, and you learn to live
          with your son's disability.
          Reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a PISTOL.
          He places it on the table next to the box.

          RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          And then there is option number
          two.

                         (BEAT)
          There is one bullet in the chamber
          of this gun.
          Reston slides the gun across the table in Arthur's direction.

          RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          You can fire this bullet into your
          wife's heart... killing her.

                         (BEAT)
          At the exact moment that her spirit
          departs the earth, this curse upon
          your son will be reversed, and both
          of his impaired senses will
          instantaneously return to normal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          Arthur looks over at Norma in disbelief... then back at the
          twins. He cannot fathom how it has now come to this.

          RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Arthur, you will then be arrested
          and charged with the murder of your
          wife... and the money will be
          placed in an interest bearing trust
          for your son to receive upon his
          eighteenth birthday.

                         NORMA
          That's not fair.

                         (BEAT)
          Let me do it. I, pushed your stupid
          button. If I deserve to be punished
          for it... then let me kill myself.
          Arthur has nothing to do with this.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          I'm sorry, but the offer is not
          negotiable.

                         (TO ARTHUR)
          And if Norma's fingers so much as
          touch the weapon at any point from
          this moment on... the restoration
          of Walter's sight and sound will be
          denied.

                         NORMA
          If Arthur has to do it... then I
          want you to make it look like a
          suicide. Arthur shouldn't be
          punished for something that I did.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          I'm sorry... but the terms of the
          offer are not negotiable.
          Arthur faces has gone completely white.

                         ARTHUR
          Is there an afterlife?
          The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Because this is purgatory, right?
          The earth is purgatory... and
          you're here to start shutting
          things down... right?
          The twins appear impressed with his foresight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          I find your theory to be quite
          fascinating. But I must remind you
          that I am unable to disclose the
          identity of my employers.
          Arthur glances out the window at all of the cameras.

                         ARTHUR
          Right. I get it.
          Reston then turns to the window...

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          Can someone please bring up the
          car?

          EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur and Norma emerge from the diner in a state of
          delirium. A SOLDIER pulls up in Arthur's TRANS-AM. He steps
          out of the car and holds the door open.
          Teague and Cahill approach... as MEN in dark suits snap
          hundreds of photographs of the couple.
          Cahill puts his hand on Arthur's shoulder... searching for
          words.
          Teague glances inside the diner... then back at Arthur.
          Arthur nods his head slowly... his mind lost... and he limps
          toward the car with Norma at his side.

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT

          Norma sits behind the wheel... allowing Arthur to ride
          shotgun. He looks weakened by the whole ordeal, and she is
          afraid he might pass out.

                         ARTHUR
          Tell me this isn't happening,
          Norma.

                         NORMA
          This isn't happening...
          She starts the engine... and they drive off.
          Arthur watches the parking lot full of MEN reflected back at
          them in the side-view mirror.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          EXT. INTERSTATE 95 -- SUNRISE

           HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA flies over 1-95 as Arthur's car
          travels north toward Richmond. A MILITARY HELICOPTER flies
          overhead... escorting them on their journey home.

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT

          Arthur sits shotgun as Norma drives them home. They have been
          riding in silence for quite some time now, having reached a
          level of complete mental and physical exhaustion.

                         NORMA
          All these years... I've given you
          the impression that Walter was an
          accident.

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah... and?

                         NORMA
          And... it wasn't exactly an
          accident.

                         (BEAT)
          I stopped taking the pill when I
          met you...

                         ARTHUR
          Why?

                         NORMA
          Because I was so afraid of losing
          you to someone prettier than me.
          Arthur just stares at her... unsure how to respond.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          For that alone... I deserve a
          bullet in the heart... don't you
          think?

                         ARTHUR
          No... I don't.
          She manages a smile. A tear rolls down her cheek as she
          stares out at the pavement and the endless trees lining
          either side of the interstate.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- EARLY MORNING

          Arthur pulls the car up into the driveway. The street is
          quiet and empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          They step out of the car. Dana is sitting on the front porch,
          waiting for them.
          She rises to her feet as they approach.

                         DANA
          Did my dad tell you why he loves
          you, Norma?
          Norma realizes that she has been involved all along. Blood
          drains from her nose.

                         NORMA
          No.

                         DANA
          Because you're an amputee. He says
          that the soul of an amputee leaks
          out into the wind... searching for
          the place where there is no longer
          flesh and bone.

                         (BEAT)
          It says that the soul that leaks is
          the soul that endures. It is the
          kindest and bravest soul of them
          all.

                         NORMA
          Where is our son?

                         DANA
          He's locked in the upstairs
          bathroom. I think he just woke up.
          Dana turns away... and begins to walk down the sidewalk in
          the opposite direction.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- NEXT

          Walter lays inside the bathtub, soaking wet. He is still
          wearing his suit from the wedding. He is shivering... looking
          around... disoriented...
          His EYE-BALLS are now COMPLETELY WHITE... pupils no longer
          visible.

                         WALTER
          Is anyone-there?!
          He begins clawing at the walls... trying to figure out where
          he is.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          I can't see!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          He climbs out of the bathtub and begins to crawl across the
          tile floor. He runs into the door... and then reaches up and
          finds the DOORKNOB. It is locked.
          He begins to bang on the door relentlessly.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

          Norma and Arthur come up the stairs and round the corner of
          the hallway. Walter's HAND reaches out through the crack
          beneath the door.
          Norma tries to open the door but there is a MASSIVE LOCK
          installed on it.

                         NORMA
          Walter!
          Norma reaches down and takes her son's hand.

                         WALTER
          Who's there?! Who's there?!

                         NORMA
          Walter! It's mom! Can you hear me?!

                         WALTER

          WHO'S THERE?!!

                         NORMA

          CAN YOU HEAR ME!!?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- NEXT

          He does not respond... and begins banging his head against
          the door... harder and harder...
          Thump... thump...

          NORMA (O.S.)

          CAN YOU HEAR ME?!!!

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

          No response... just his head... slamming against the door
          repeatedly.

                         ARTHUR
          We need to kick the door down.

                         NORMA
          He could get hurt...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          Norma begins to pound back on the door with her fist... and
          eventually the thumping stops. She begins to hear quiet sobs
          from inside the bathroom.

                         WALTER
          Who's there? Who's there?
          Norma rises to her feet.

                         NORMA
          Come downstairs, Arthur.
          She takes his left hand... as he clutches Walter's hand in
          his right.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Arthur...

                         (BEAT)
          I need you to come downstairs with
          me... right now.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

          SUZANNE WELLER (30s) sits on her bed. Her husband KENNETH
          WELLER (30s) stands at the window. Neither looks like they
          have slept in a while.
          Suzanne has the box sitting on the mattress in front of
          her... the glass dome is open.

                         SUZANNE
          I'm gonna push it.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur and Norma stand across from one another in the
          kitchen. Arthur holds the GUN in his right hand... and he
          slowly limps over to his wife and takes her into his arms.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma...

                         NORMA
          Arthur... I love you, and I'm so
          sorry... I'm so sorry that I did
          this to us...

                         ARTHUR
          I'm the one who told you to push
          the button... so don't apologize.
          He looks out through the window at his back yard... likely
          for the last time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          I love you too... and please
          know... that I regret nothing in
          this life we've lived together.

                         NORMA
          I'll be waiting... counting the
          days until my Arthur comes to see
          me.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Suzanne Weller smiles at her husband... reaches her finger
          out and places it on the button.
          She then presses down.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          FROM UPSTAIRS... thump... thump... their son's head banging
          against the door...

                         NORMA
          It's going to be harder for you to
          live than for me to die.
          Arthur closes his eyes... the noise is excruciating. There is
          no time to wait any longer.

                         ARTHUR
          Well then.

                         (BEAT)
          Let's get on with it.
          Arthur kisses her... then steps back... still clutching her
          hand... raises the gun... and fires off a round into her
          heart.
          Norma collapses... Arthur falls with her... breaking her fall
          with his arms as they collapse into a heap onto the linoleum
          floor.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Suzanne looks over at her husband and lets out a deranged
          giggle. He smiles back.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur looks down into his wife's eyes as the life drains
          from her body. Seconds later... Norma is dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          BLOOD begins to flow from the exit wound in her back across
          the linoleum. Arthur is now covered in it.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Walter crawls across the blood-soaked kitchen floor and
          reaches up to the PHONE that is mounted on the wall. He takes
          his finger and places it in the cradle... dials 911.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- 911 EMERGENCY -- NEXT

          The CAMERA tracks along a series of CUBICLES at the POLICE
          STATION in downtown Richmond. An OPERATOR sits at each
          cubicle... each one female.

                         OPERATOR #1
          911 emergency... how may I direct
          your call?
          The CAMERA moves in closer...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur has the phone to his ear... imprints of his wife's
          blood are smeared on the phone's receiver.

                         ARTHUR
          Yes. This is Arthur Lewis at 1560
          Monument Avenue. I've just shot my
          wife... can you please send an
          ambulance?
          The Operator begins to ask more questions... but Arthur does
          not listen. He hangs up the phone.
          The thumping from upstairs has now subsided.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)

          WALTER!!!
          He pulls himself to his feet and heads into the foyer.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur rounds the corner at the base of the stairs...

                         ARTHUR

          WALTER!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

          Arthur rounds the corner of the upstairs hallway... rushes
          toward the bathroom door.
          Walter's hand comes sliding out from beneath the crack in the
          door. Arthur grabs it.

                         ARTHUR

          WALTER!!!

                         WALTER
          Dad?

                         ARTHUR
          Yes... can you hear me?

                         WALTER
          Yeah.

                         ARTHUR
          What do you see? Where are you
          Walter?

                         WALTER
          I'm in the bathroom...

                         ARTHUR
          Can you see clearly?

                         WALTER
          Yeah... I can see... everything is
          bright... but I can see.

                         ARTHUR
          Everything is bright. Everything is
          bright Walter... you're gonna be
          okay, buddy.

                         WALTER
          What's going on?

                         ARTHUR
          You're gonna be okay, buddy. That's
          all that matters.

                         (BEAT)
          That's all that matters, now.
          Out of the corner of his eye, Arthur notices something at the
          top of the stairs. It is a POLICE OFFICER. He has his gun
          aimed at Arthur.

                         POLICE OFFICER

          BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND PUT

          YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Arthur stares at the officer... frozen... the repercussions
          of his decision now stare him in the face with a loaded gun.

          POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)

          I SAID BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND

          PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!!
          Arthur obeys... and the cop rushes over and pushes him over
          onto his stomach... handcuffing his wrists together.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          The DOORBELL rings.
          Suzanne Weller opens the door. Arlington is standing there
          with his briefcase... smiling.

                         ARLINGTON
          Mrs. Weller... do you have the
          button unit?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- LATER THAT MORNING

          A CORONER places a BLANKET over Norma's face as the house is
          sealed off by various CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS and other
          police.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur is now being escorted by two POLICE OFFICERS to a
          waiting CRUISER that is parked in front of the house.
          Jim Burns is standing there with the door open.

                         ARTHUR
          I'm sorry, Jim.
          He stares Arthur down as he is put into the back seat of the
          cruiser. Jim closes the door and goes around to the front of
          the car.
          Jim gets behind the wheel and starts the engine.
          Arthur looks back through the window, toward his house.
          Upstairs in the MASTER BEDROOM WINDOW... Walter is watching,
          tears streaming down his face.
          Arthur reaches up with his hands... cuffed together... and
          tries his best to wave at his son.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)

                         (MOUTHING SILENTLY)
          I`m sorry...
          From the window... Walter watches the car pull away from the
          curb.
          He places his hand on the glass... waving back.

              A gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway. On the
              embankment beside the hole BRENDAN FRYE squats, shoulders
              hunched. His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the
              shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel.
          
              THE WATER
          
              not more than six inches deep. Just beneath the surface a
              young woman's pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against
              the edge of her body like a docked boat. A pebble plinks
              into the water beside it.1

              A single locker. That same arm, bracelets and all, slips a
              note through the slats, then leaves quickly.
          
              As the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker.
              Opens it. The note falls to his feet.
          
              The figure is Brendan. He unfolds the note (folded in a
              triangle) -- "12:30 PICO & ALEXANDER".

              He sits on the curb of a wide suburban street, eats lunch
              from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the corner. He
              shows no surprise when it begins to ring. Brendan goes to
              the phone and puts the receiver to his ear. Silence for a
              moment, then a thin female voice from the phone.

          Her voice thins to a high, strained breath. She is crying.

          Brendan's eyes glance around the surrounding street. Emily
          is crying again.

                           Why not?
          
                                     EMILY
                           I screwed up real bad. I really screwed
                           up.
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           Screwed up how?
          
                                     EMILY
                               (blubbering, fast and
                                incoherent)
                           I did what she said with the brick, I
                           didn't know it was bad, but the pin's on
                           it now for poor Frisco and they're
                           playing it all on me-
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           Slow down now, what?
          
                                     EMILY
                           You gotta help me Brendan I think tug-
                           Oh!
          
              With a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black
              mustang roars by. Brendan drops the receiver and spins out
              of the booth.
          
              There, another pay phone up the hill -- empty.
          
              Brendan turns to the black mustang, far down the street. A
              man's hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side
              window.1
          
              The mustang turns the corner, gone.
          
              Brendan walks after it, finds the cigarette butt on the
              street. Still smoking.
              A pale blue arrow is printed on the filter.
          
              In the distance the class bell rings.
          
              EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          
              The high school is open air - the hallways are alleyways
              between buildings. A short kid with eyeglasses the size of
          
          1
           Because of the orientation of the street, this was all flipped when we shot it, and the
          hand came from the passenger window. The dialogue in the ending field scene was
          changed to match, causing mass confusion for about half an hour on set.
          
                                                                         4
          
          
          Volkswagen headlights sits against the wall. Brendan enters,
          leans on the wall beside him.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Brain.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Hey Brendan. It's been awhile. Where you
                    been eating?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Back of school.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Huh. Yeah, no one's seen you. What's it
                    been, a couple months?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah, it's been awhile. You gave Emily
                    my locker number?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    A few days ago. Was I wrong?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    To give it?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    It's been so long, I don't know you
                    two's stats.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    It has been awhile.   Who's she been
                    eating with?
                              THE BRAIN
                        (uncomfortable)
                    I dunno. It's hard to keep track.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Is it?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                        (shrugs)
                    Can be.
          
          The Brain avoids Brendan's gaze.
          
                                                                        5
          
          
                                BRENDAN
                    Uh huh.
          
          A beat.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    She hasn't been doing too good.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah well. I'm not looking for a patch
                    up. Em's life is her own. But she
                    asked for my help.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Help with what?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I don't know. I don't even care, it's
                    not my business. I just want to know
                    she's ok, so I've got to find her.
                    That's all this is.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Well. I know she was poking in with the
                    Ivy-bound cheerleading elite. Laura
                    Dannon's crowd.
          
          Across the parking lot a beautiful girl with dark long hair
          kisses an football player.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Laura Dannon there with the Rabbit?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Yeah. Brad Bramish with her. Cream on
                    the upper crust.
          
          Brad laughs heartily.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (softly)
                    He's a sap.
          
                                THE BRAIN
                    Know him?
          
                                BRENDAN
                    By sight.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    I won't argue then. Anyway Em tagged
                    after them for a bit, but it didn't
                    work. So she picked her way down the
                    food chain. Last I seen she was with
                    whasshername, that drama vamp. Small
                    time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one
                    you dated-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Kara.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    That's my bus.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You know her locker number?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Kara's?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Em's.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    239.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Thanks Brain. Keep your specs on, find
                    me if she shows.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Sure.
          
          The Brain trots off. In the distance Brad and Laura laugh,
          and he kisses her. Her hair blows in the wind.
          
          EXT. LOCKER CAGE - DAY
          
          Empty. Locker 239 is open, its door swinging gently in the
          wind.
          
          EXT. BACK OF GYM - DAY
          
          Brendan sits against the massive building, flipping through
          loose papers. He finds two photographs, one of Emily hugging
          him, the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at
          a party, drinks in hand.
          
          Sorting more papers, he finds a red card with a sequined
          mask on the front. The bottom edge has been torn off.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
          Sixth period has broke. Masses of students pile into busses.
          
                                                                        7
          
          
          EXT. SCHOOL THEATER - DAY
          
          A huge chunk of brown building. Brendan strides towards it.
          
          INT. SCHOOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Drama people sit on the floor facing the stage. Brendan
          steps behind one, the sharp-eyed girl from the picture. She
          holds a freshman boy's head in her lap. Pets it like a dog.
          
          She looks back at Brendan, her face in shadow.
          
                              GIRL
                        (through a mocking smile)
                    Hello, Brendan.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Kara.
          
                              KARA
                    Come to see the show?
          Kisses the freshman's forehead, purring.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No, I didn't.
                        (nudges the freshman with his
                         toe)
                    Lapdog, blow.
          
          The freshman sits up, looks to Kara like a spooked puppy.
          
                              KARA
                        (to the lapdog)
                    Stay.
                        (to Brendan)
                    Don't be mean.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I'm all friendly.
                        (to the lapdog)
                    Watch your head, kid - that thing bites.
          
          The dog pops up again. Kara pulls him down and nuzzles his
          ear.
          
                              BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    I need words.
                              KARA
                    I'm listening.
          
                                                                                                  8
          
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           About Emily Kostich.
          
              She stops nuzzling a little too quickly.
          
                                     KARA
                               (to the dog)
                           Get me my purse.
                               (he goes)
                           Hurry!
          
              He breaks into a trot. Kara smiles at Brendan.
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           Still picking your teeth with freshmen?
          
                                     KARA
                           You were a freshman once.
          
              She slides her fingers up his arm. He growls and pushes them
              away.
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           Way once, sister. You and Em were tight
                           for a bit. Who's she eating with now?
          
                                     KARA
                           Eating with?
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           Eating with. Lunch.           Who.
          
                                     KARA
                           You're a cutie.
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           You gonna tell me?
          
                                     KARA
                           Guess you're up from the underneath
                           then. The whole Jerr thing blown over.
                           Lucky strikes, you and your partner get
                           bulled, you come up clean. But I guess
                           you were always the brains of the
                           outfit.1
          
          1
            One of many instances of an allusion to the Jerr backstory, most of which were
          trimmed back in the editing process for clarity. The author has threatened to write it as
          a stand alone short story, but probably never will, so in a nutshell: when Brendan and
          Emily were still an item she started hanging out with Jerr, a small time dealer. Brendan
          didn't approve, so he partnered up with Jerr then ratted him out to Trueman. Emily
          found out, and that led to their breakup on the field, which we see in a flashback.
          
                                                                         9
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Where's Emily?
          
                              KARA
                    Sometimes I wonder why I dumped you.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                           (standing to go)
                    God.
          
                              KARA
                    I don't know where she's at, Brendan.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I know you do, so why don't you want me
                    to find her?
          
                              KARA
                    Maybe I'm looking out for you.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (going)
                    Well I appreciate that.
          
                              KARA
                    Brendan... you looking to get back into
                    things? I could use you.
          
          He is gone.   Behind Kara, the play goes on.
          
          INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS
          
          The play is seen in shadow-play through the backdrop.
          
          Brendan slips in through an exit door, crosses the backstage
          area and enters the dressing rooms.
          
          INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cramped and empty. Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck
          in the mirror. Brendan roughly searches drawers, bags,
          pockets... nothing. He stops. A red edge behind one of the
          photos - the same red card with a mask on it, but whole.
          Across the bottom in small print: "Halloween in January -
          Call for DETAILS - 555-2394"
          
          INT. BRENDAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Brendan pulls a phone across his desk and dials the number
          on the flyer.
          
                                                               10

                    Hello?
          
          Brendan hesitates.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Hello, ma'am, this is Tom, I'm a friend
                    from school. Could I speak to...
          
          He trails off.
          
                              WOMAN'S VOICE
                        (over phone)
                    Oh, hi Tom. Laura's here, hold on.
          
                                 LAURA'S VOICE
                           (over phone)
                    Yes?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I'm calling for details.
          
                                LAURA'S VOICE
                    For what?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Details about the party.
          
                              LAURA'S VOICE
                    Who is this?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I don't think we've met.
          
                               LAURA'S VOICE
                    Well then I don't think you're invited
                    to my party. It's a rather exclusive
                    gathering.
                              BRENDAN
                    I can imagine.
                        (she starts to speak, he cuts
                         her off)
                    You should really work on your invite
                    management. That might be a personal
                    'room for improvement' area in your
                    life. But discretion of your invite
                    sending aside, I have procured a certain
                    someone's invitation, and would like
                    details.
          A beat of silence.
          
                                                                            11

                    You think you're cute, whoever you are.
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Wait'll you get a load of my felt fedora
                    and spats.
          
                              LAURA'S VOICE
                    Who are you? Or I'll hang up.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You don't know me - I'll save you some
                    time.
          
                              LAURA'S VOICE
                    I know everyone and I've got all the
                    time in the world.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Folly of youth. Ask whose invitation
                    I've got.
          
                              LAURA'S VOICE
                        (slightly)
                    What you said.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Emily Kostich.
          
          A beat.
          
                              LAURA'S VOICE
                    15 Bush street, up in Stockton Cove.
                    Buzz 42 at the gate. Nine o'clock. But
                    who-
          
          Brendan hangs up. He folds his hands under his chin and
          stares at the phone, perfectly still. The clock on his desk
          says 4:53.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          7:37
          
          Brendan at his desk, tapping away at Tetris.

          8:30
          The desk is empty, Tetris paused. A shower runs behind an
          ajar door in the background.
          
                                                                                                12
          
          
              EXT. STOCKTON COVE GATE - NIGHT
          
              An imposing private community gate. Brendan coasts up on his
              bike and ditches it in the bushes. He checks the call box
              directory: "42 -- DANNON"
          
              Using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks
              briskly up the street.
          
              EXT. STOCKTON COVE STREET - NIGHT
          
              Shiny cars line the curb. Party noises come from an upscale
              two story house. Brendan takes a short breath, then strides
              up to the front door.
          
              INT. LIVING ROOM
          
              Large and clean, with a two story ceiling and a railed
              staircase at one end. Fifteen or twenty clean people, some
              in costumes, mill about in cliques. Brendan comes in as if
              he doesn't mind who sees him coming in. He gets a couple odd
              stares, but no one stops him.
          
              With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to
              the beer keg in back and draws half a cup.
          
              INT. PARLOUR - SAME
          
              Richly adorned, crowded, lit with bright pools of light.
              Brendan drifts in and stands in the back, deep in shadow.
          
              The music comes from a baby grand piano set against one
              wall. Laura Dannon leans against it. She wears a red
              kimono, and is striking against the velvet black piano.
              Laura's kid sister, 11 years old with glasses, sits at the
              piano playing "All I do is Dream of You".
          
              Laura sings, lovely and soft but with strength.1
          
              Brendan watches from the back, his face obscured in shadow,
              but his eyes gleam. Through the darkened window behind him
              a match flares up, and someone standing outside lights a
              cigarette.
          
              Laura finishes the song. The room applauds, and she ruffles
              her kid sister's hair.
          
              Brendan ducks out, and into
          
          1
           By the time we got around to production this had changed to "Someone to Watch Over
          Me," but the publishing rights proved too expensive (i.e. not free.) We chose the Gilbert
          & Sullivan song, which besides being lovely was also in the public domain (i.e. free.)
          
                                                                         13
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
          
          Brad Bramish, the jock who was kissing Laura in the parking
          lot, sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd. He holds a
          cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named Biff at his
          elbow.
          
                              BRAD
                    If the coach wants to play me I'll play,
                    but I can't put my best game in if I've
                    got to worry about whether I'm going to
                    be in there. Halftime last game, coach
                    is pissed I ran it on a pass play, out
                    on the field he says to me 'you gotta
                    think about the team and you gotta' you
                    know and 'if you run that ball again
                    you're out', and I said to him you gotta
                    let me play! I'm out there, let me play,
                    and he's saying 'no you're out' and I
                    kept saying 'Let me play! Let me play!
                    Let me play!', just right in his face-
          
                              BIFF
                    He was!
          
                              BRAD
                    Just 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me
                    play!' 'No you gotta' 'No, let me play!
                    Let me play! Let me play!'
          
          Brad hunches forward, his face swollen purple, yelling that
          over and over. Tom steps in front of Brendan, blocking his
          line of sight.
          
          Brendan scans the rest of the room. His eyes catch on Laura,
          leaning against a divan. Her bright, sharp eyes cut through
          the room, straight into Brendan.
          He wags his eyebrows at her.
          
          She looks away quickly. Brendan turns back to Brad, still
          shouting 'let me play'. Tom stands between them.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Tom!
          
          Brad falls silent. Most of the room follows suit. Tom turns
          around. Brendan smiles good naturedly.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    Could you step aside, please? I'm
                    trying to follow Brad's story, and it's
                    difficult when I can't see his face.
          
                                                                         14
          
          
          The room watches Brendan. Tom mumbles something and steps
          aside. Brad stares at Brendan stupidly. Brendan flashes a
          dopey grin and tips his glass.
          
                              BRAD
                        (stumbles)
                    He doesn't give me a play to make, what
                    can I do, you know?
          
          He falls into awkward silence. Biff starts babbling.
          
          Brendan looks at Brad, who is staring back at him.
          
          Brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to Laura, staring at
          him too, her eyes slightly amused. Brendan cocks an eyebrow.
          The slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth,
          and she wags her eyebrows once at him.
          
          Brendan glances back at Brad, looking at Laura now, not
          amused at all.
          
          Brendan stands to go. Biff chatters on. Brad cuts him off.
          
                              BRAD (cont'd)
                    Hey. Hey! What are you doing here?
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Leaving.
          
                               BRAD
                    Oh yeah?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Uh huh. Unless your anecdote's got a 2nd
                    act.
          
                              BRAD
                    Why don't you leave?
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (leaving)
                    That's what I was doing.
          
          INT. DARK ROOM
          
          With a lit wet bar at one end. Brendan goes to the bar, puts
          ice in a glass and cracks it with liquor.
          
                              LAURA
                        (O.S.)
                    Whiskey?
          
          Brendan pauses, glass touching his lips.
          
                                                                         15
          
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Jameson.
          
          He downs half of it.
          
                              LAURA
                    I like a man who knows what he's
                    drinking.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    That's a pretty sick thing to be
                    attracted to.
          
                              LAURA
                    Brad's not a good guy to get on the
                    wrong side of.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Uh huh.
          
          They stare at each other in silence. She studies his face.
          The broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid.
          
                              LAURA
                    Fearless flyer. Quit your yappin and fix
                    me one.
          
          and slips out a sliding glass door.
          
          He fills another glass with whiskey and cuts his with water.
          
          EXT. BACK PATIO - NIGHT
          
          Brendan joins Laura, hands her a drink. Suburban lights fill
          the valley below. Laura sips her drink.
          
                              LAURA
                    I'll never get through all this.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Uh huh.
          
          She sips more.
          
                               LAURA
                    I knew your old partner Jerr since grade
                    school. Tough break. How long were you
                    two joined up before your operation got
                    the sting?
          
                                                     16
          
          
                    BRENDAN
          A few months. Could have helped himself
          out by turning me in, but he took the
          heat. He was a good guy. Solid.
          
                    LAURA
          Was he?
          
                    BRENDAN
          You knew him.
          
                    LAURA
          Yeah I did. So why are you here tonight?
          
                    BRENDAN
          I'm looking for Emily.
          
                    LAURA
          She wasn't invited.
          
                    BRENDAN
          She had an invitation.
          
                    LAURA
          Well like you said, I've got to work on
          that. Em's been AWOL for a good month,
          nobody's seen her.
          
                    BRENDAN
          I saw her yesterday.
          
                    LAURA
          Nearly nobody's seen her. So what did
          she tell you?
          
                    BRENDAN
              (winces)
          Score 0 for finesse.
          
                    LAURA
          Listen, you're scratching at the wrong
          door. I wasn't with Emily enough to know
          details of what she was in, I just got
          wind of the downfall, and I didn't get
          any details of that, except that it was
          bad. So now that we're showing some
          cards...
          
                    BRENDAN
          If you haven't got a finger in Em's
          troubles, why'd her name get me into
          your rather exclusive party?
          
                                                                        17
          
          
                              LAURA
                    Keep up with me now. I don't know, but
                    it sounded like you did, and a body's
                    got a right to be curious. Now I'm not
                    so sure.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Well I'll put that body to bed. I don't
                    know a damn thing about whatever
                    troubles, and that works for me. I just
                    want to find her.
          
          A long beat. Laura studies Brendan's face, then seems to
          come to a decision.
          
                              LAURA
                    Coffee and pie.
          
          The words hang in the air a moment. A look of recognition
          from Brendan.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Coffee and pie oh my?
          
                              LAURA
                    And you didn't hear it from me.
          
          He sips his drink. A voice calls from the glass door.
          Another girl. Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her.
          They have quick, quiet words and the girl leaves. Laura
          turns back to Brendan.
          
                              LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    Will you wait here for me?
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Sure.
          
                              LAURA
                    You'll stay right here and wait -- I'll
                    be five minutes.
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Yes.
          
          The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops
          the fence, into the neighbor's yard.
          
          EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE
          
          Brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks
          around. Laura comes out the front door, cuts across the
          lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street. Brendan
          
                                                                         18
          
          
          begins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops
          him - a match being struck.
          
          Brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a
          splintered hole.
          
          BRENDAN'S POV - THROUGH THE FENCE
          
          A brightly lit window in the side of Brad's house, and
          through the window the party.
          
          A dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat, all
          inky black. The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the
          party, absently stroking his cheek.
          
          Brendan steps back - SNAP!   A twig.
          
          The figure freezes. Then, making no noise at all, it spins
          to face Brendan, a towering black form against the window.
          
          The glowing cigarette falls to the grass.
          A metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun.
          
          Brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass. A beat.
          
          Through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away.
          
          Brendan hesitates, then hops the fence.
          
          EXT. SIDE OF BRAD'S HOUSE - SAME
          
          Brendan lands on his feet. No black figure to be found.
          
          The cigarette still smolders on the ground. Hand rolled,
          plain paper.
          
          Brendan gazes through the window, catching his breath. Then
          he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street.
          
          EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
          
          Peeking around the house, Brendan sees Laura cut across the
          lawn and trot into the street. Using parked cars as cover,
          Brendan follows.
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Between cars, Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and
          engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a
          black Mustang. Laura goes to him and speaks quickly.
          
                                                                         19
          
          
          The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows. Laura
          says something to him. Grunting something angrily, he gets
          in the car with the bald kid and peels off.
          
          Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house.
          
          When she is gone Brendan stands, throws a look back at the
          house and walks off down the street, towards the guard gate.
          
          EXT. BACK PATIO
          
          The two drinks, where Brendan left them. Laura takes hers
          and drains it. The suburban lights twinkle like stars.
          
          EXT. CARROWS PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          The sun rises over Carrows family restaurant, a squat
          structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel
          ravine.
          
          A banner from 1973 in the window - "Coffee and Pie oh my!"
          A pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster.
          Their beady eyes follow Brendan in sync as he approaches.
          
          He goes to the nearest one.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Where's Dode?
          
                              STONER 1
                    Dunno, bra.
          
          Silence and blank stares. Brendan calmly moves to the next
          stoner.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Dode?
          
                              STONER 2
                    Uh uh.
          
          Brendan moves to the next one.
          
          A thin head pokes from around the dumpster.
          
                              DODE
                    Hey Brendan. Maybe you shouldn't be
                    here.
          
          Brendan steps around the dumpster. Dode slumps against the
          wall, thin and delicate in dusty black. Slivery eyes, pale
          lips, muffled intelligence.
          
                                                                         20
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Kara told me you know where Em's at.
          
                               DODE
                    Uh huh.   And why are you looking for Em?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    She asked for my help.
          
                               DODE
                    Uh huh. Listen man, I've got plenty on
                    my plate without dealing with some
                    jilted ex.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    It's not about that.
          
                              DODE
                    Whatever it's about, act smarter than
                    you look and drop it.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Where is she?
          
                              DODE
                    She's with me, and right now that's the
                    best place for her. Leave the low life
                    to the low lifers and dangle.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You're on the bright side of dim, Dode,
                    but if I thought you had this half-
                    handled I'd be eating lunch. Where's
                    she at?
          
                              DODE
                    Better get while it's good.
          
          Brendan doesn't.
                              DODE (cont'd)
                    Heel it now, dig?
          
          The 5 big stoners appear behind Brendan, threatening.   Dode
          turns his head away to light a joint.
          
          Brendan's fist slams into his face, sending the joint
          spinning. Brendan slams Dode's frail frame against the
          dumpster.
          
          The 5 stoners stand in the exact same position, deer in the
          headlights. One makes a half hearted motion to intervene.
          
                                                                     21
          
          
                                 BIG STONER
                    Back off.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Throw one at me if you want, hash head.
                    I've got all five senses and I slept
                    last night, that puts me six up on the
                    lot of you.
          
                                 BIG STONER
                    Just easy-
          
          Brendan slams Dode into the wall.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (to Dode)
                    Where's Em?
          
                              DODE
                        (deliberate)
                    She's with me. She was tight when she
                    called you, man. Came to and freaked.
                    She told me to shake you if you came by.
                    Said you'd only make things worse.
          
          Brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly
          well. He drops Dode.
          
                              STONER 1 (O.S.)
                    Put him down, man!
          
                              DODE
                    Deal with whatever this ain't about and
                    drop it.
          
                              BIG STONER
                        (to Brendan)
                    Nothing more here, bra.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her
                    if she still wants my help or not that's
                    her business, but I want to hear it
                    straight from her.
          
                              DODE
                    She don't -
          
          Brendan walks away.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Today. She knows where I eat lunch.
          
                                                                            22
          
          
          When Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner
          shouts with conviction
          
                              BIG STONER
                    And stay out, punk!
          
          EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
          
          Brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes.
          
          A moment later Dode hustles away from Carrows. Brendan
          follows.
          
          EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING
          
          The sun is rising as Brendan tails Dode through the twisty
          suburban streets.
          
          Brendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback.
          
          A girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode. Her wrist is
          adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead
          girl's arm. Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks
          back. He hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a
          brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket
          pocket. They embrace again, Dode walks off and the girl gets
          in her car.
          
          Brendan stumbles after the car, but it is quickly gone. He
          watches it go, then follows Dode back towards school.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL THEATER - MORNING
          
          Dode slumps into the front door of the brown building.
          Brendan watches him from a distance, eyes thoughtful. After
          a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of
          students.
          
                                                             FADE OUT:
          
          FADE UP
          
          EXT. BACK OF SCHOOL - MIDDAY
          
          Brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long,
          empty utility road behind the school.
          
                                                                    LATER
          
          Reclining on the wall, reading "Lord of the Flies". He
          raises his eyes, and sits up suddenly.
          
                                                                           23
          
          
          Off in the distance on the utility road a tiny figure
          approaches, stumbling. Brendan jumps and hits the ground
          running towards the figure.
          
          Meet the girl with cheap bracelets, the girl Dode spoke to,
          the dead girl, Emily. He catches her just as she stumbles
          and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered
          hallway.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Emily and Brendan sit in silence. She is very pretty, but
          she looks bad. Too much makeup, not enough sleep. She
          sniffles, speaks to her shoes.
          
                              EMILY
                    I must have sounded pretty crazy on the
                    phone. Yesterday.
          
          She taps her shoes together lightly, eyes fixed on them.
          
                              EMILY (cont'd)
                    It was dumb, I got paranoid over a
                    really stupid thing. I was high, I went
                    crazy for a little bit, but now you have
                    to forget about it. Please. That's how
                    you can help me now, forget about it.
          
          She turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time.     His
          stare is unwavering, searching. She pushes on.
          
                              EMILY (cont'd)
                    Brendan, I know you're mad at all these
                    people, cause you think I went away from
                    you and went to them. But you've got to
                    start seeing it as my decision, stop
                    being angry because where I want to be
                    at's different from where you wanna be
                    at.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (angry)
                    Who fed you that line, Em?
          
          She looks back at her shoes.
          
                              EMILY
                    And stop picking on Dode. He's a good
                    guy.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    The Carrows rat?
          
                                                                        24
          
          
                              EMILY
                    He's a good friend.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    So what am I?
          
                              EMILY
                        (strained anger)
                    Yeah, what are you? Eating back here,
                    not liking anybody, how are you judging
                    anyone? I loved you alot but I couldn't
                    stand it, I had to get with people. I
                    couldn't heckle life with you, I had to
                    see what was what.
          
          A beat. She taps her clogs. One has a hole worn through the
          sole. Her face contorts, seizes up, and she is sobbing.
          
                              EMILY (cont'd)
                    I'm sorry Brendan.
          
          She buries her face in his shoulder. He has a hard time
          speaking.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You've got to come back to me, Em.
          
                              EMILY
                    No. No. Never. I'm sorry. Never. I can't
                    love on your terms, Brendan. I can't do
                    that, I'm not like you.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You're in a spot, I can get you out of
                    it. Come back to me, and whatever heat
                    follows you I'll deal with.
          
                              EMILY
                    No. You're not hearing me, no. I don't
                    want to be put away and protected. No.
          
                              EMILY (cont'd)
                    No.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Tell me about the trouble, the brick and
                    the pin -
          
                              EMILY
                    You gonna fix things like you did with
                    Jerr? No. I came to say goodbye, for
                    good. Whatever you have to do to let me
                    go, do it. I'm gonna let you go, I've
          
                                                                                             25
          
          
                          decided that. Make sure that, you've got
                          to, promise you won't torture yourself,
                          that you'll let me go.
          
              She embraces him, enveloping him in her jacket. His face is
              a frozen mask.
          
                                       EMILY (cont'd)
                          Let me go.
          
              As she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from
              her jacket pocket.
          
              He watches her as she walks away.
          
              INT. CLASSROOM
          
              Brendan sits in the back, flipping through the address book.
              The teacher drones on about the significance of the pig's
              head in "Lord of the Flies".1
              THE ADDRESS BOOK
          
              Illegible scribbles, names, numbers, nothing that stops his
              search - then the note Dode gave her, a corner of loose-leaf
              paper which looks like this:
          
          
          
          
              Brendan studies the paper intently.
          
              EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          
              The Brain studies the paper. Busses pull into the parking
              lot behind them. Brendan is distant, lost in thought.
          
                                    THE BRAIN
                          Hm. Do you know anything else about
                          this?
          
          
          
          
          1
           Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to Brendan's lunch spot to save us
          a location change. The degree to which the lack of classroom time in the film has been
          commented on has always bemused the author, who cannot for the life of him
          remember a single interesting thing that happened in a classroom in high school.
          
                                                               26
          
          
                                BRENDAN
                          (shakes his head)
                    Mm.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Slim pickings. Why'd you let Dode fly
                    when he came back to whose-her-name, at
                    the theater?
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (shrugs dismissively)
                    Kara. It's their turf, I couldn't hear
                    them without being seen, and that would
                    only biff their play. Best to know it's
                    there, let it ride and see what comes of
                    it.
                        (touches the paper)
                    But anyway.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Hm. Well, if this is what I think it is,
                    it didn't come straight from Dode, less
                    he's playing out of his league.
                        (beat)
                    I can only give you my best guess.
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Yeah.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    When the upper crust does shady deeds
                    they do them in different spots around
                    town. I know under the pier's one, down
                    by the bike trails in the state park's
                    another. There's alot of them. The pitch
                    is they've got little symbols for each
                    one, and that's how they tell each other
                    the place, so word won't get around. So
                    this might be that.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    But Dode wouldn't know it?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    This is upper crust. Dode's pie pan
                    grease.
          
          Brendan studies the symbol.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Call anything up?
          
                                                                          27
          
          
                                 THE BRAIN
                       How many places start with 'A'? Or if
                       it's a shape, or just a random symbol.
                       Anyway, even if you figured it out, what
                       good could you do? She's smart, she
                       knows the play, she's gunning to square
                       things.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                       Yeah.
          
                                 THE BRAIN
                       You said her business was none of yours,
                       so she's alright, forget it now. Go
                       home, sleep.
          
          INT. BRENDAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Sparsely furnished. Brendan plays Tetris on his computer,
          staring off into space. His mom's voice calls "Good night"
          and the hallway light turns off.
          
                                                                  LATER
          
          10:30 by the clock radio on Brendan's nightstand. The slip
          of paper rests beside it. Brendan lies in bed, staring at
          the symbol on the paper. His eyes tense.
          
          THE SYMBOL
          
          Growing larger, burning with a searing intensity, then
          folding into darkness. Water rushes overhead, over concrete,
          concrete with a hole in it -- the runoff tunnel, just for an
          instant, then back underwater, screaming. Brendan choking,
          screaming, plunging upwards. A woman with no face falls from
          the darkness and kisses him, her long hair sweeping around
          him then pulling away. As the last strands slide off his
          face he wakes up with a start.
          
          The clock says 3:46. Brendan drips with sweat, breathing
          raggedly. He takes the paper and a pencil from the
          nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this:
          
          
          
          
          FLASH CUT - The runoff tunnel, lining up perfectly with the
          now shaded symbol.
          
          BACK TO BRENDAN
          
                                                                        28
          
          
          His eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks
          off the light.
          
          EXT. BRENDAN'S HOUSE - DAWN
          
          Brendan walks off into the hazy pre-dawn light.
          
          EXT. EDGE OF RAVINE
          
          Brendan stops at a high wall of weeds, listening to the low
          gurgle of moving water. Slowly, robotically he pushes
          through.
          
          EMILY'S BODY
          
          Face down, bobbing gently in shallow water. Bluish white.
          Red foam clings to her.
          
          EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL
          
          Silently, as if lowered by a string Brendan sinks down,
          squatting in the mud. His lungs empty in one choppy breath.
          He pulls his glasses off sluggishly.
          
          EMILY'S ARM
          
          Lifeless, pale.
          
          BRENDAN'S FACE
          
          A contorted, frozen mask, eyes wet.
          
          EMILY'S HAIR
          
          Stringy, flowing gently in the water.
          
          BRENDAN'S EYES
          
          Dazed, drifting... then suddenly snapping to attention.
          
          A noise. From the tunnel.
          
          Brendan freezes. The inky blackness of the tunnel mouth
          opens like a vacuum... silent, but then -
          
          The scrape of a shoe against concrete, then echoing
          footsteps running away.
          
          Brendan springs like a cat, sprinting into the tunnel.
          
                                                                         29
          
          
          INT. TUNNEL
          
          Nearly pitch black. 2 sets of running footfalls. Brendan is
          chasing, running full speed into the blackness, heart
          pounding - we almost don't notice that Brendan's are now the
          only footfalls.
          
          Brendan notices. He stops. Silence in the darkness, except
          for Brendan's breath... and someone near...
          
          SLAM! Brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down. An
          inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in
          the stomach. Brendan curls on the ground, the figure over
          him.
          
                              FIGURE
                        (low whisper)
                    Your little Em.
          
          The figure runs off. Brendan raises his head painfully - the
          figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end
          of the tunnel, then is gone.
          
          EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING
          
          Emily's body is still there. Brendan crawls out of the
          tunnel and collapses in the shallow water, beside the body.
          He rests his head on his arm, eyes on Em's hair.
          
          EXT. CAMPUS - EARLY MORNING
          
          Cold and barren, nearly empty. Brendan limps across the
          barren lawns.
          
          EXT. PHONE BOOTHS
          
          A line of phone booths on campus. Brendan nearly collapses
          against one. He dials, still in a stupor.
          
                              VOICE ON PHONE
                    Saint Clement police.
          
          Brendan stares into space, eyes burning
          
                              VOICE ON PHONE (cont'd)
                    Saint Clement police, hello? Hello?
          
          Brendan hangs up.
          EXT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Early morning mist below a squat brick building.
          
                                                                      30
          
          
          INT. LIBRARY
          
          Warmly lit, sheltering the few souls scattered here and
          there at tables. The Brain sits at one of them reading an
          impossibly large book. He watches curiously as Brendan
          approaches him.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Hey, Brendan.
          
          Brendan falls into a chair. The Brain looks him over.
          
                              THE BRAIN (cont'd)
                    You're up early.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (thick, distant)
                    I couldn't sleep.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                        (nods, back to his book)
                    Find Emily?
          
          Brendan breathes out softly.
          
                              THE BRAIN (cont'd)
                    You alright?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah. What, are you here for zero?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Nah, I gotta take the early bus, cause
                    the others don't run by my street.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Bad break.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Eh. Time to read's nice. So what's the
                    word with Em?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    She's gone.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Can't raise her?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No, I can't.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    So what now?
          
                                                                        31
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Now. I don't know. I guess it's... I
                    don't know.
          
          Brendan takes a long moment. He stares down at his glasses,
          wet with condensation.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    Brain, I can't let her go. I was set to
                    but I can't. I don't think I can.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    You think you can help her?
          
                                BRENDAN
                    No.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    You think you can get the straight,
                    maybe break some deserving teeth?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah. I think I could.
          
                                THE BRAIN
                    Well.
          
          Brendan rubs his forehead.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Kara tried to rope me. She came right
                    out and asked. She was scared. Tell me
                    to walk from this, Brain. Tell me to
                    drop it.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Walk from it. Drop it.
                        (grins)
                    You're thick as what-all, Brendan.
                                BRENDAN
                    Yes I am.
          
          Brendan cleans his glasses. He looks Brain in the eye, and
          his mannerisms come back into focus.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    I'd need you to Op. Like on Jerr, but
                    that was cake to this. And unlike Jerr,
                    there's not much chance we'll come out
                    clean. Twenty four seven on this one.
                    You okay to op for me again?
          
                                                                                              32
          
          
              The Brain barely smiles.
          
                                    THE BRAIN
                          What first, tip the bulls?
          
              Brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go.
          
                                    BRENDAN
                          No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash
                          their dusty standards at the wide-eyes
                          and probably find some yegg to pin,
                          probably even the right one. But they'd
                          trample the real tracks and scare the
                          real players back into their holes, and
                          if we're doing this I want the whole
                          story. No cops, not for a bit.
          
                                    THE BRAIN
                          So what first?
          
                                    BRENDAN
                          I don't know. Your mom still have the
                          cell?
          
                                    THE BRAIN
                          In her car.
          
                                    BRENDAN
                          Borrow it for a few days, get me the
                          number.
                              (stands to go)
                          Wait for my word, and cover for me first
                          period. I'm going to be a little late.
          
              EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY
          
              A vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball
              courts outlined in cracked paint.1 Brendan trudges across
              it, his steps heavy. He stops and stands very still, staring
              at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to
          
              THE HORIZON
          
              Flat, gray, pin straight. Brendan's voice starts speaking
              rapidly, confident and clear.
          
          
          
          1
           This describes the location at my school that the "showdown" scenes were originally
          written for. Between when I wrote the script and when we shot it, however, the school
          expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball field, and so we reluctantly
          moved these scenes to the football field.
          
                                                                              33
          
          
                                      BRENDAN (O.S.)
                            Yeah it was personal. Jerr spooked some
                            decent gees and ran around some what was
                            straight with him, but I'm nobody's bull
                            runner. This wasn't a business sit. But
                            yeah. I bulled him. Got in tight,
                            partnered up and sent him over.
          
               PAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN. He looks different, edgier,
               more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1. He
               keeps talking directly at us.
          
                                      BRENDAN (cont'd)
                            I'd bull the lot of them, Em, I'd burn
                            down the whole party if they tried to
                            play you again. Jerr and whoever's next.
                            I want to keep you safe.
          
               An ARM swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets
               and pale blue fingernail polish. It slaps Brendan hard in
               the face. He catches it. Emily wrenches her arm away and
               stumbles backwards onto the pavement.
          
               Brendan grabs her sleeve. She twists away. He grabs her
               shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they
               are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a
               shout she breaks away and falls to the ground.
          
               A beat.     Gulls cry in the distance.
          
                                      EMILY
                            You can't keep me safe, Brendan. I'm in
                            a bigger world now, and you can't hide
                            me from it, and you can't beat it. Not
                            if I don't want you to.
          
               Brendan's face looks lumpish, while Emily's is strong. She
               stands and walks off into the distance across the barren
               field.
          
               BRENDAN'S FACE
          
               Watching her go. It is back to present day, pale, clean
               shaven, sullen. His eyes are cold with resolve.
          
               EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING
          
               Brendan sloshes down into the water. Without delicacy he
               lifts Emily's body and pulls her back into the tunnel.
          
               INT. RUNOFF TUNNEL
          
          1
              Which Joe would not even consider, thank god.
          
                                                                                             34
          
          
              Pitch back. Brendan lays the body down. Two beady eyes peer
              at him from the darkness - he freezes. The eyes hop forward
              - a gull. The two watch each other for a moment, then the
              gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the
              tunnel. Brendan follows it without looking back at the
              body.1
          
              EXT. CROWDED HALLWAY - DAY
          
              Brendan and the Brain lean against a wall. The Brain slips
              him a piece of paper.
          
                                    THE BRAIN

                          Better stop meeting me in the open too.
                          I'm going to start getting visible, and
                          I need you on the underneath. I'll call.

                          I bet. Keep him off me - stonewall him,
                          he won't bite, just keep him away from

                          Make Em's troubles mine. I'm going to
                          throw a few words at you, tell me if
                          they catch. Brick.

           A very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left, and revealed a dark figure
          (Dode) creeping away from the top of the tunnel, causing the pebble described on page
          1 to plink into the water.

           All apologies to Frisco Farr, who the author did actually go to school with, and who
          was neither a druggie nor `real trash', but was a great guy who simply had a very cool
          sounding name. He is now (the author was horrified to learn) practicing law.

                           You think the Pin's just a tale to take

              Brendan strides past forest scenery and drama geeks, through
              another door and into sunlight.

              Kara smokes a cigarette. Brendan leans beside her.
          
                                     KARA
                               (annoyed)
                           Hey Brendan. Here for the show?

                           No.
          
                                     KARA
                           Would you go then, honey, cause I've got
                           this headache.
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           Try smoking like a chimney, I've heard
                           that helps.

          Brendan grabs the pack of cigarettes.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    Isn't this Dode's brand?
          
          Kara snaps her head towards him, a flash of anger. She
          catches herself and smiles cooly.
          
                              KARA
                    You don't know Dode's brand.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Oh I do now.
          
          Angry again, Kara snatches the pack from him.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    I'm going to start shaking things up.
                    Give me the story and you might miss the
                    bite.
                              KARA
                    The story about what?
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Alright.
          
          He turns and walks away.
          
                              KARA
                    The story about what?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I don't want to play games if you've got
                    a headache. Get me if you want to spill
                    it, but I can't guarantee safe passage
                    after tonight.
          
                              KARA
                    I don't know what-
          At the stage door, not slowing.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling
                    card, and I need words.
          
                              KARA
                    Brad Bramish?
          Through the door and into the theater.
          
                                                                         38

          He spins to see Kara's face just before the door closes.
          She's worried.
          
          EXT. CROWDED SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          
          The Brain walks out of a classroom and Brendan swings behind
          him.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (fast and low)
                    Tail Kara through lunch. She's got
                    rehearsal but she'll blow early. She
                    goes home, drop her, else wait for my
                    call.
          
          The Brain turns and Brendan's gone.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - LUNCH
          Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a
          cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far
          end of the lot.
          
          Brad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his
          convertible, front door open. A small crowd hangs about
          Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow.
          
                              BRAD
                    That's all I'm saying, is put me in the
                    game and I'll do what needs to be done,
                    but they don't put me in, what needs
                    doing don't get done and don't come
                    crying to me, man. Get off my grill man,
                    you didn't put me in, don't come to me
                    if you didn't let me play.
          
                              BIFF
                    They didn't!
          
          Brendan scans the rest of the cars. His eyes catch on Laura
          Dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side. Her
          bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into Brendan.
          
          He wags his eyebrows at her. She looks away. Brendan walks
          into Brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against
          one of the cars.
          
                              BRAD
                    Hey! What are you doing here?
          
                                                                    39
          
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Listening.
          
                                 BRAD
                    Uh huh.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the
                    Gophers.
          
                              BRAD
                        (not amused)
                    Oh yeah?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Of all things, yeah. Been watching your
                    game for a month, but that story just
                    now clenched it. You've got heart, kid.
                    How soon can you move to Minneapolis?
          
          A few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near Brad.
          
                              BRAD
                        (flat with anger)
                    Yeah?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Cold winters, but they've got a great
                    public transit system.
          
                                 BRAD
                    Yeah?
          
                                 BRENDAN

                              BRENDAN
                    There's a thesaurus in the library.
                    'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait.
          
                              BRAD
                    Who invited you?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of
                    invited myself.
          
                              BRAD
                    I think you'd better leave then.
          
                                                                         40
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No, I'm having too good a time.
          
                              BRAD
                    Just the same.
          
          Brendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his
          legs. Brad's face tenses.
          
                              BRAD (cont'd)
                    Maybe you want to go someplace more
                    private.
          
                                BRENDAN
                    With you?
          
          Brad says 'who else?' by lifting his arms.
          
                               BRENDAN (cont'd)
                        (as if he's been asked to the
                          movies)
                    Sure.
          
          Brendan stands and walks off. Brad follows and the rest of
          the crowd trails after him.
          
          He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad.
          People gather around in a wide circle.
          
          Brendan pulls his jacket off as Brad hangs back, mumbling.
          
                              BRAD
                    You know what's good for you you'll just
                    beat it. Beating a small frye won't win
                    me anything and it's not going to do you
                    any good-
          
          Laura pulls up in her convertible, behind Brad, watching.
          
          In the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist
          in his face.
          
          Brad grunts but doesn't lose ground. Brendan throws his
          short stocky frame into Brad's larger one and tenderizes his
          midsection with jabs.
          
          Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his
          hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the
          pavement.
          
          He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched.
          
          Brendan kicks Brad full force in the shins.
          
                                                                         41
          
          
          Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard
          with the point of Brad's chin. Brad gets his balance fast,
          and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself,
          then another, both into Brendan's stomach. Brendan pulls
          back and kicks Brad's shin where he had kicked it before.
          Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face.
          
          Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his
          weight into a square punch right into Brad's nose.
          
          The sound of eggs breaking, and Brad falls backwards like a
          board.
          
          He stays down, holding his face.
          
          Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the
          small crowd. Some stare at Brendan, some at Brad, but nobody
          seems about to do anything. Brendan runs his sleeve over his
          face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few
          people rushing over.
          
                              STRAGGLER
                    Hey, is there a fight?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah.
          
          He throws a last look at Laura, who meets his gaze and
          drives off.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
          
          Brendan walks away from the lot, towards the school. Laura
          pulls up beside him in her car.
          
                              LAURA
                    Hey.
          
          Brendan ignores her and b-lines for the school. Laura brakes
          hard, parking by the curb.
          EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Brendan limps down the hallway.    Laura appears behind him,
          trotting to catch up.
          
                              LAURA
                    You're quite a pill.
                              BRENDAN
                    Uh huh.
          
                                                                   42
          
          
                              LAURA
                    Where are you going?
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Home.
          
                              LAURA
                    Why did you take a powder the other
                    night?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Same reason I'm taking one now.
          
                              LAURA
                    Hold it.
                        (he keeps walking)
                    I don't get you. That's a chilly heel to
                    be giving a girl who's where you want to
                    know about.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I'll get where I'm going just fine.
          
                              LAURA
                    I want to help you.
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Go away.
          
          Silence behind him. He stops, turns wearily. She looks
          genuinely hurt.
          
                              BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    Look, I can't trust you. You ought to be
                    smart enough to know that. I didn't
                    shake the party up to get your
                    attention, and I'm not heeling you to
                    hook you. Your connections could help
                    me, but the bad baggage they bring could
                    make it zero sum game or even hurt me,
                    so I'm better off coming at it clean.
          
                              LAURA
                    I wouldn't have to lead you in by the
                    hand-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I can't trust you. Brad was a sap, you
                    weren't, you were with him and so you
                    were playing him, so you're a player.
                    With you behind me I'd have to tie one
                    eye up watching both your hands, and I
                    can't spare it.
          
                                                                      43
          
          
                              LAURA
                    You're not Brad.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No, I'm not.
          
          He turns and walks away. She doesn't follow.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PAYPHONE - AFTERNOON
          
          Brendan slumps against it, receiver to his ear, licking a
          bruised lip. He wears dark glasses.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                        (on the phone)
                    You didn't call.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Sorry. Kara went home though, didn't
                    she?
                              THE BRAIN
                    Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and
                    made two calls that she didn't want on
                    her phone bill.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Get the numbers?
          
                                 THE BRAIN
                    No. Sorry.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    S'alright. Are me and Brad front page
                    news?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    All the buzz. You really do that?
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Yeah.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Why? Is Brad the Pin?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field
                    and his crew didn't bite. So now I know
                    he's a sap and anyone who acts like he
                    isn't is profiting by it. That's not why
                    I roughed him, though.
          
                                                                           44
          
          
                                 BRAIN
                    For kicks?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Economics. Brad's the school's biggest
                    jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all
                    the selling, I just got his attention.
                    Anyway, now's just shaking things out.
                    Look, you know a kid around the burgh,
                    lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black
                    tang?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    I told you before I don't know the car.
                    Those types are a nickel a pound, but
                    nobody I know that you don't. And
                    Trueman again-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I
                    need to find that kid.
          
                                 THE BRAIN
                    Okay.
          
          Brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly.
          
          A lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots
          punches him in the face.
          
          Brendan hits the pavement. The lanky kid is over him in a
          split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy
          blows.
          
          Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin
          triangle runs down the side of his face.
          
          After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with
          several other blurry figures. A car peels out and roars off
          O.S.
          
          Brendan lies still. The class bell rings, very distant. Legs
          criss cross before his eyes, each blurring the world a bit
          more until it is completely smeared.
          
                                                               FADE OUT.
          
                                                                FADE IN:
          
          INT. OFFICE
          Brendan sits with an ice pack against his head in a tiny
          office. A man in his early thirties behind a wood colored
          
                                                                  45
          
          
          desk and name plate, "GARY TRUEMAN, ASSISTANT VICE
          PRINCIPAL" plays with a pencil.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    You didn't know this boy?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No sir, never seen him.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    And he just hit you?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Like I said, he asked for my lunch money
                    first. Good thing I brown bagged it.
          
          Trueman trains a good natured dubious eye on Brendan.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    Alright Brendan. I've been looking to
                    talk to you.
          
          Brendan doesn't react.
          
                              TRUEMAN (cont'd)
                    You've helped this office out before.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No. I gave you Jerr to see him eaten,
                    not to see you fed.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    Fine, and well put.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasprzyk.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    Tough teacher?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Tough but fair.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    Mm. Anyway then, we know you're clean,
                    and you've, despite your motives, you've
                    been an asset to us. I think you're a
                    good kid.
                              BRENDAN
                    Uh huh.
          
                                                               46

                    I want to run a couple names by you.
          
          Brendan stands to go.
          
                              TRUEMAN (cont'd)
                    We're not done here.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (angry)
                    I was done here three months ago. I told
                    you then I'd give you Jerr and that was
                    that, I'm not your inside line and I'm
                    not your boy.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    That's not a very helpful-
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (anger builds)
                    You know what I'm in if the wrong yeg
                    saw me pulled in here?
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    What are you in?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No. And no more of these informal chats
                    - if you've got a discipline issue with
                    me write me up or suspend me and I'll
                    see you at the parent conference.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    Hold it, I could - hold it - could write
                    you up for talking back to a VP. For
                    looking at me in a threatening way. I'd
                    exercise a little more tact, Mr. Frye.
                    You can't pull a play like that unless I
                    need you for something. So do I?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Maybe.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    So maybe you're gonna need me too.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back
                    completely for a few weeks. There might
                    be some heat soon.
          
                                                               47
          
          
                              TRUEMAN
                        (interested)
                    If it's something I can't cover, I won't
                    go to bat for you.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    If I get caught like that it's curtains
                    anyway - I couldn't have brass cutting
                    me favors in public. I'm just saying now
                    so you don't come kicking in my homeroom
                    door once trouble starts.
          
          Trueman bites a thumbnail.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    Okay, here's what I can do. I won't pin
                    you for anything you aren't caught at.
                    I'll ride it a little while, as long as
                    it doesn't get too rough. But if
                    anything comes up with your fingerprints
                    on it, I can't help you. Also, if I get
                    to the end of whatever this is and it
                    gets hot and you don't deliver, The Veep
                    will need someone to hand over, police-
                    wise. And I'll have you. There better be
                    some meat at the end of this like you
                    say, or at least a fall guy, or you're
                    it.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask.
          
          EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - AFTERNOON
          
          Gary Trueman throws Brendan out.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    Get the hell off my campus, punk!
          Brendan glances around, and limps off.
          
          EXT. CARROWS PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
          
          No stoners, no Dode. Brendan breathes uneasily.
          
          EXT. PAYPHONE BY CARROWS - AFTERNOON
          
          Brendan leans against it.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    No, Dode's MIA all around.
          
                                                                         48
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who
                    knows where. I shook but she's not
                    spilling.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    No more job offers? So she's got a play.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    And I know enough about Kara to let that
                    worry me. Alright, keep your specs on
                    for him. Any other news?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Some. Laura Dannon came to me looking
                    for you.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (considers this)
                    She did, huh?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Fourth period, nearly shook me upside
                    down. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but
                    why'd she come to me?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you
                    know me.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Yeah, well. She's some piece of work. If
                    I had known where you were I might have
                    told her.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode,
                    tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives
                    in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll
                    call you tonight.
          
          EXT. SIDEWALK - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Bordering a supermarket. Brendan trudges along. Suddenly he
          stops. Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black
          mustang.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The sun hangs low. Brendan approaches the car and walks
          around it slowly. He peers inside. A tuft of paper pokes out
          from under the seat. He pulls the door handle, locked.
          
                                                                         49
          
          
          Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground,
          waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head,
          ready to drop it through the window.
          
          He stops. His eyes catch something in the distance.
          
          The lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger.   Coming
          towards him fast.
          
          Brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall
          to the ground. He casually leans against the car, removes
          his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case
          in his pocket.
          
          Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the
          pavement. Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys.
          
          Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff. Tug
          turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. Brendan falls
          to his knees.
          
          While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily.
          Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him
          back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth,
          three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone,
          catching himself on his hands and knees. The car door slams.
          
          The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the
          parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan. Its
          motor purrs deeply. Brendan begins to limp towards it
          doggedly, head up, eyes fixed.
          
          A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang
          forward. It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank.
          
          Brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady.
          The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all.
          
          It speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the
          edge of his jacket. Brakes squeal behind him. Brendan turns
          and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away.
          
          He stops at the window.   Tugger eyes him curiously, with
          some respect.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I want to see the Pin.
          
                              TUGGER
                        (nods slightly)
                    Yeah, I guess you do.
          
                                                                                                      50
          
          
                EXT. STREETS
          
                Twisty and narrow. The black mustang flies through them at
                impossible speeds, roaring past like a bullet.
          
                DARKNESS
          
                Loud engine noise, jostling, grunting. Then a metallic
                jangle, some scraping, and a CLINK!
          
                EXT. REAR OF FAST MOVING MUSTANG - LATE AFTERNOON
          
                The trunk pops open, revealing Brendan holding a jack rod.
          
                INT. MOVING MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS
          
                Tug is putting a tape in the deck, eyes down. Behind him
                the trunk pops open, then pulls down out of sight just as he
                looks back up.
          
                INT. TRUNK OF MOVING MUSTANG
                Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough
                to see which street signs pass by. Loud music plays from the
                car -- "Sweet Baby James" by James Taylor.1
          
                The car zooms on.
          
                BRENDAN'S POV
          
                Through the ajar trunk. The mustang slides to a stop beside
                an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head.
                Brendan closes the trunk.
          
                EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
                A small one story house, slightly run down. Tugger opens the
                trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm,
                slams the trunk and goes inside.
          
                When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open.
          
                INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY
          
                A very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end,
                dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other
                end. Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway, drops him and
                goes into the lit room.
          
          
          
          
          1
              Unfortunately Mr. Taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise.
          
                                                                        51
          
          
          Brendan lifts his head painfully. Surrounding him in the
          darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like
          Tugger, others dressed in black.
          
          Tug pokes his head out.
          
                               TUGGER
                    Alright.
          
          Arms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the
          lit room.
          
          INT. KINGPIN'S DEN
          
          A small room, amazingly messy. Clothes strewn about, groves
          of empty bottles, precarious piles of books. The overall
          impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest,
          comfortably woven and very worn in.
          
          A slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a
          small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp.
          
          Brendan is shoved into the center of the room. Tug and his
          clones slump against the surrounding walls. Brendan watches
          the thin figure's back. For a beat the only noise is the
          scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and
          swivels around.
          
          Mid to late twenties. Sallow features, tired eyes. His
          clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out
          specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the
          neck down and eyebrows up.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You the Pin?
          
                              PIN
                    Yeah.
                        (beat of silence)
                    So now I'm very very curious what you're
                    going to say next.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Maybe I'll just sit and bleed at you.
          
          The Pin shifts in his seat, bored.
          
                              PIN
                    Helled if you're gonna go breaking my
                    best clients' noses and expect me to
                    play sandbag. Anyway you've been
                    sniffing me out before then, sniffing
                    for me like a vampire bat for a horse
          
                                                                        52
          
          
                    with a nick on its ear he can suck on.
                    They do that.
                        (Brendan blinks)
                    So now you got Tugger to bring you here,
                    which he never does, and you got me
                    listening, so I'm curious what you've
                    got to say that better be really, really
                    good.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first;
                    she oughta hear this.
          
                              PIN
                        (amused)
                    No dice, soldier. Would have been a neat
                    trick, though.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (shrugs, then slowly)
                    I was going to make up some bit of
                    information or set up some phony deal,
                    anything so you'd let me walk. Then I
                    was going to go to the vice principal
                    and spill him the street address of the
                    biggest dope port in the burgh.
          
          The Pin's eyes shoot to Tugger, who doesn't flinch.
          
                              TUGGER
                    He knows zippo.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at
                    the desk in the den in the basement of
                    the house with the tacky mailbox.
          
          The world turns on its side as Tugger pushes Brendan's head
          down into the carpet.
          
                              TUGGER
                    You gonna do what now?!
          
          The Pin walks towards them. One of his shoes is twice the
          size of the other.
          
                              PIN
                    No good, soldier.
          
          The cronies around the room begin cackling. Tug's face is a
          mask of rage. Brendan can't breath. His face swells.
          
                                                                         53
          
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    Alright, let up.
          
          But Tug doesn't let up. Brendan's world grows hazy, the
          cackling laughter reverberates, then a clean voice pierces
          the din.
          
                                 LAURA
                        (OS)
                    Tug, stop.
          
          Tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go. Brendan's
          head lolls to the side. Laura stands in the dark doorway.
          
          Brendan sees Tug's knuckles and a flash of white for a split
          moment as Tug hits him in the face. The Pin's black body
          spills out across the frame, leaving us in black.
          
          FADE UP
          
          SMALL DARK ROOM
          
          Brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor. A bare
          light bulb hangs from the ceiling. Tugger sits five feet
          away, watching him like a hungry dog. Brendan stares back at
          him through thick, glazed eyes.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Where are my glasses?
                        (Tugger grins)
                    Hell with ya then. Which wall's the door
                    in?
          
          Tug points, amused. Brendan heaves himself up, and Tug
          shoves him back down.
          
          Brendan winks at him, stands and lurches towards the door
          again.
          
          Tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall, but
          freezes when he hears a door latch click. Sneering, he drops
          Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite
          wall.
          
          Sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness.
          Light footsteps clack on the cement floor. Suddenly Tug
          vanishes -- the room's darkness just seems to swallow him.
          
          The thin whispery voice of the Pin speaks softly.
          
                              PIN
                    Sorry about this kid, but what the hell
                    with what you said before.
          
                                                                         54
          
          
          His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had
          sat.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    Where you were at, with all of us and
                    the Tug a fist away, you've got to use
                    your nut. Allay the situation, So yeah,
                    you're not scared of me, I got it, but
                    I'm also thinking you're a little nuts
                    now, so you've got that trade off with
                    your standing. But nuts isn't all bad,
                    so maybe it was a good play. I don't
                    know.
          
          He is standing in front of Tug. His black clothes and broad
          rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room, such
          that his face seems to bob about in space. Brendan stifles a
          cough.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    So, Laura talked me down. Let's get you
                    upstairs, back with the living.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes. The
          kitchen is on the first floor of the Pin's house, or rather
          the Pin's mother's house. She is a soft old lady in a pastel
          cotton dress, currently bent over the fridge mumbling.
          
                              MOTHER
                    I thought we had orange juice, Brendan,
                    I'm sorry. How about Tang, or that's
                    more like soda isn't it, or not soda but
                    it hasn't got any juice in it, it can't
                    be very fortifying.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Water's fine, ma'am, thanks.
          
                              MOTHER
                    Now just a moment, we have apple juice
                    here, if you'd like that, or milk,
                    though you've got that in your
                    cornflakes, I don't know if drinking it
                    as well might be too much.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Apple juice sounds terrific.
          
                              MOTHER
                    It's country style.
          
                                                                       55
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    That's perfect.
          
          She shuts the fridge. Tugger and the Pin sit behind her,
          looking comfortably bored. The Pin, a sharp black hole
          against the soft yellow kitchen, eats oatmeal cookies with
          small delicate bites.
          
                              MOTHER
                    I'll even give it to you in a country
                    glass, how'd that be? Boys?
          
                              TUGGER
                    I'm fine, Mrs. M.
          
                              PIN
                    Thanks, mom.
          
          The Pin kisses her on the cheek.
          
                              MOTHER
                    Okay, well I'm going to go, um, do
                    something in the other room now...
          
          She shuffles out.
          
                              PIN
                        (to Brendan)
                    So hows bout we take another snap at
                    hearing your tale?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I don't know. It starts out same as
                    before, and this floor ain't carpeted.
          
                              PIN
                    We're cooled off.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty
                    cool putting his fist in my head. I want
                    him out.
          
          The Pin grins thinly, uncomfortable.
          
                              PIN
                    Looky, soldier-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    The ape blows or I clam.
          
                                                                       56
          
          
                              TUGGER
                        (stands violently)
                    So clam! What've you got I can't beat
                    out of you back in the basement?
          
          The Pin and Brendan are perfectly still, watching each
          other.
          
                              PIN
                    Give us a few minutes, Tug.
          
          Tug turns to him, but Pin keeps his eyes on Brendan.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    I'll call you if whatever.
          
          Beat. Tug stomps off, slamming the narrow door hard behind
          him. The Pin goes back to gnawing his cookie.
          
                                PIN (cont'd)
                    So?
          
          Brendan sets down his spoon.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    About a year ago I had a small time
                    dealing partnership with Jerr Madison.
                    Know him?
          
                              PIN
                    Till he took the fall for you.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah well. I didn't ask him to, but he
                    was a straight player. I got out clean -
                    almost. Nothing on my official record,
                    but the VPs play it like I owe them one.
                    When I made it clear I wasn't playing
                    their hound dog, well they didn't like
                    it. They keep calling me in, badgering
                    me.
          
                              PIN
                    Gee that's tough.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I don't like being told whose side I'm
                    on. So now they think I'm on your trail,
                    I'm in a nice spot to know their
                    movements and feed them yours.
          
                                PIN
                    I gotcha.
          
                                                                         57
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You haven't got me yet.
          
                              PIN
                    What, price?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Considering the benefits my services
                    could yield, I don't think that's
                    unreasonable.
          
                              PIN
                    And what are your services exactly, just
                    so I can be specific on the invoice?
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (shrugs)
                    Whatever serves your interests.
          
          The Pin stands.
          
                              PIN
                    Fair enough. I'll have my boys check
                    your tale, and seeing how it stretches
                    we'll either rub or hire you. You'll
                    know which by end of the day tomorrow.
          
          Brendan stands but doesn't follow as the Pin opens the
          narrow door Tugger went through and descends the dark stairs
          behind.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    We're done.
          
          The moment the Pin vanishes into the basement's murk Laura
          comes up out of it. She takes Brendan's hand.
          
                              LAURA
                    I'll drive you back.
          INT. LAURA'S CONVERTIBLE MOVING - SUNSET
          
          They zig zag though the twisty suburban streets. Brendan
          stares sullenly into space.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Just drop me at school.
                        (they take a hard turn)
                    How long was I out?
          
                              LAURA
                    Half an hour. It took all of it for me
                    to cool the Pin down.
          
                                                                                                   58
          
          
                                     BRENDAN
                               (flatly, but sincerely)
                           Thanks.
          
              They drive on in silence.
          
              EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DUSK
          
              Laura's convertible stops, and Brendan climbs out painfully.
              He studies her face for a moment.
          
                                     LAURA
                           You trust me now?
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           Less than when I didn't trust you
                           before. If you can tell me your angle in
                           this, maybe I can.
          
                                     LAURA
                           Come here.1
          
              Brendan leans on the car, his face close to hers.
          
                                     LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                           I'm on the in, top level of the tower
                           and I know everyone, but I don't know
                           all what goes on. I knew Em when she
                           tried to get with me and Brad, and I
                           liked her. She was smart. But she wasn't
                           us, and it didn't work. When she left
                           she took some souvenirs, dirty habits
                           she wasn't strong enough to control and
                           a connection to the Pin to keep them
                           going. With me?
          
                                          BRENDAN
                           So far.
          
                                     LAURA
                           A few months go by, and the next I hear
                           the Pin's raging over a situation with
                           some certain junk Em was partial to, and
                           the downfall's coming on Em's head.
          
                                     BRENDAN
                           You think Em scraped the junk off the
                           Pin?

           Not to weasel in a plug, but the original version of this scene (shot as written) is on the
          deleted scenes section of the DVD. Available at fine retailers everywhere.
          
                                                                         59
          
          
                              LAURA
                    I don't know, but whether she scraped or
                    copped or just ran her tab around the
                    world and into her own back, it must
                    have been grand. I've never seen the Pin
                    so hot.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    This all helps but it's not what I
                    asked. What's your angle in all this?
          
                              LAURA
                    I don't know. I'm usually pretty sharp,
                    but... maybe I see what you're doing for
                    Emily, trying to help her. And I don't
                    know anyone who would do that for me.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Now you are dangerous.
          
          Throwing the car in gear, she peels out and leaves him
          standing alone in the fading evening light.
          
          INT. BACKSTAGE
          
          Brendan pushes through the gloom, past forest scenery,
          deeper and deeper until he comes to a door.
          
          INT. WOMAN'S DRESSING ROOM
          
          Hazy and cramped. Everything blends into the color of flesh.
          No walls are visible; it is all billowy piles of costumes.
          Brendan pushes in. Kara sits at the mirror, putting on
          eyeliner.
          
                              KARA
                        (sing song)
                    Brendan Brendan Brendan!
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Where's Dode flopped?
                        (she makes a face)
                    I know you two are cozed up, so you'll
                    tell me or you won't.
          
                              KARA
                    Oooh, getting feisty.
                        (giggles)
                    Last time we talked you were giving
                    ultimate-tims.
          
                                                               60
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    It worked. You went to Laura, didn't
                    you? Told her my tale.
          
                              KARA
                    All part of your plan?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Turned out to be.
          
                              KARA
                    I feel so cheap and used.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Gol, I must seem a real cad. Sometimes I
                    just hate myself.
          
          Kara grins dreamily.
          
                              KARA
                    Whatever happened to us, Brendan?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Where's Dode flopped?
          
          She turns to face him.
          
                              KARA
                    We were a pair and a half for a few
                    months, weren't we? Sometimes I miss
                    having someone I can talk to. You ever
                    miss having someone? I guess you must.
          
          Brendan's face is a mask.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I need to hear Dode's tale about Emily.
                    It's important.
          
                              KARA
                        (darkly)
                    You better be sure you wanna know
                    whatcha wanna know.
          
          Brendan stands, coughing.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Uh huh. Laura's working with me now, and
                    I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner
                    soon. The sooner I get the truth from
                    Dode or the truth about Dode from you,
                    the safer you'll both be. No? Pass it on
                    to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the
          
                                                                        61
          
          
                    sense to get out from under you before
                    he gets hurt.
          
                              KARA
                    You didn't, did you?
          
          Brendan leaves without looking back.
          
          INT. BRENDAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Brendan's at his desk, on the phone.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                        (on the phone)
                    So what happens now?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless
                    his crew spotted VP Truman's social call
                    this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us
                    70/30. If we're in I get under his skin
                    and see what's what. You stick to Kara,
                    keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay
                    away from Laura.
          
          The Brain is quiet for a beat.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    I think she's with us, Brendan.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (too sharp)
                    I'll let you know when she is.
          
          A beat of silence.
          
                               THE BRAIN
                    Okay.
          
          Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment
          in silence.
          
          EXT. LOCKER CAGE - MORNING
          
          The class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties. Brendan
          limps in, opens his locker. A note falls to his feet. It is
          folded into a star. He pulls it open. "TWELVE THIRTY PICO &
          ALEXANDER".
          He fishes the old note out and compares them - different
          handwriting.
          
                                                                         62
          
          
          The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the
          steady sound of heavy footfalls. Brendan looks up from the
          notes.
          
          A lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. He wears a
          black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair
          comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You the Pin's?
          
          No answer. The lug keeps coming.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    So what's his answer?
          
          Closer, not slowing. Brendan tightens his hand into a fist.
          Then CLICK! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the
          lug's right paw.
          
          Brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso.
          Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is
          running.
          
          EXT. CAMPUS SQUARE - DAY
          
          Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug
          follows.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Wind rushing, sweating, the lug very close. Their footsteps
          clatter on the cement. Brendan swings around a corner,
          doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost
          sight of him.
          
          Brendan sweats, listening. The lug's footsteps echo through
          the hallways, coming from all directions at once. Then it
          seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right.
          Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his
          knife hand flashing. Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open,
          and the white filling inside turns red. He stumbles back
          blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach.
          
          Brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty
          feet on the lug before turning the corner.
          
          Brendan drops to a sitting position.
          
          THE LUG AROUND THE CORNER
          
          Running fast.
          
                                                                         63
          
          
          BRENDAN
          
          Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet. The lug's
          footsteps are impossibly loud.
          
          THE LUG
          
          Just about to round the corner.
          
          BRENDAN
          
          On his socked feet running silently back towards the corner.
          The lug's footsteps crash like symbols as they both come
          around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed.
          
          Brendan slides like a baseball player, tangling his legs
          into the lug's. The lug pitches forward with frightening
          momentum. He hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms
          and head. A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway,
          and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut.
          A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID (CHUCK
          BURNS), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed
          and a large brownie in another baggie.
          
          Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off.
          
          EXT. CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY
          
          Brendan breathes heavily into the phone.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a
                    sheepdog.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                        (on the phone)
                    Yeah I know him, I just can't pin him to
                    any crowd. He's definitely not muscle
                    for anyone. He taps the Carrows crowd
                    but doesn't hang with them. If you've
                    got a guess I could check it out-
          
                               BRENDAN
                    The Pin. If he's with the Pin
                    everything's kablooie and I gotta blow
                    the burgh.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    I'll check it. I'm in third now-
          Brendan spots the Pin's Cady pulling into the parking lot.
          
                                                                         64
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Never mind. If I don't call by three
                    call in the bulls.
          
          Brendan hangs up and begins walking at a normal pace along
          the sidewalk.
          
          The cady pulls up beside him, and he stops walking. The door
          swings open and a voice comes from inside.
          
                               VOICE
                    Get in.
          
          With no perceivable hesitation, he does.
          
          INT. CADILAC - DAY
          
          Brendan sits beside the Pin. The windows are tinted and the
          car is very dark. The seats are pink vinyl. The car lurches
          forward.
          Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at
          each other.
          
                               BRENDAN
                    So?
          
                              PIN
                    So. Tangles.
          
          A stocky kid in the front seat turns, and reaches into his
          jacket. For a moment he stays like that, hand in his jacket,
          eyes on Brendan. Brendan's face is placid.
          
          Tangles pulls out an envelope and drops it in Brendan's lap.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    That's what you'll get every week for
                    your services. Less of course there's a
                    specific job involved, in where you get
                    sliced in with my crew. Square?
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Yeah.
          
          Silence. The Pin holds his hat in his hands, fingering the
          rim.
          
                              PIN
                    We're doing a thing down at the Hole

                                    BRENDAN
                          South of T Street, yeah.
          
                                    PIN
                          It's sort of a welcome you in thing.
                          Eight o'clock.
          
              The car stops.
          
              EXT. CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY
          
              Brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they picked
              him up. The Cady drives off. Brendan checks his watch.
          
              BRENDAN'S WATCH
          
              12:32. A phone begins to ring.
          
              EXT. PICO & ALEXANDER - DAY
          
              Brendan looks up from his watch and answers the payphone,
              holding the receiver to his ear in silence.
          
                                    VOICE
                              (on the phone)
                          I know what you did. I saw what you
                          did.1
          
              The voice is low and garbled, filtered through something.
          
                                        BRENDAN
                          So?
          
                                    VOICE
                          Anyone I tell, it would ruin you some
                          way. And I'm going to tell someone.
          
                                    BRENDAN
                          Are you making an offer?
          
                                    VOICE
                          Maybe. Or maybe I'll just do you in.
          
                                    BRENDAN
                          Hire another hash head to blade me?

           Originally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery, but during post
          production we decided it was one layer too many, and identified the caller as Dode.
          Brendan's first line was overdubbed in post to say `Dode?" instead of "So?"
          
                                                                        66
          
          
                              VOICE
                    Don't need no blades, shamus. I just
                    gotta squawk.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What do you want?
          
                              VOICE
                    Just to see you sweat.
          
          CLICK. Brendan replaces the receiver and stands still for a
          moment. Then he inserts a coin and dials.

                    Yeah.

                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah, I'm fine. Keep digging on the
                    Burns lug, but the main thing is to find
                    Dode. He set up whatever Emily walked
                    into, it's getting more and more urgent
                    we talk.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Alright. Trueman was looking for you.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Trueman and the VP?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    No, just Trueman.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Asked for me?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    No, but looked.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    That's not good. Alright, keep me
                    posted.
          
          Brendan hangs up.

              EXT. BEACH - NIGHT1
          
              A bonfire burns about a hundred feet off. Figures jump
              through the blaze to thrash music. The Pin and Brendan
              wander towards us on the dark beach.

                           So I'm going to start you on the dope
                           circles, cleaning up the Turkish dues,
                           pulling in the strags.

                           Anyway there isn't much else doing. I'm
                           tailing out this big deal, but that's
                           almost done.
          
                                     BRENDAN

                           Big time. Biggest I ever done, and there
                           was a snag in it, but it's almost done
                           now.

                           It's over enough. You're gonna make me
                           curious, being so curious.
          
              They sit in the sand, facing the breakers.

                           I gotta lay something out. You're coming
                           into a certain situation, and I'm
                           bringing you in sort of because of it.

            If ever you want to witness a look of pure horror, shoot a micro budget feature film and
          tell your cinematographer that there will be an extended scene on a beach at night.
          Turns out it's difficult to light up a beach without very large and expensive equipment.
          Who knew. Shooting at sunset proved a fortunate and less horror inducing solution.
          
                                                                 68

                      I didn't tell Tugger to hit you for the
                      Brad Bramish thing. Laura and I, I
                      decided I oughta hear what you were
                      gunning for before I made an enemy. Tug
                      just did it, though. He was hot, and he
                      just hit you. He's been doing that.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                      Yeah?

                      He's got my best interests, I know, he's
                      loyal, he just gets hot.

                      You're working for me, not Tug, that's
                      all.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                      Alright.
          
          
          A moment of silence. The breakers crash.

                      Things can get, you know, it's tough

                                 BRENDAN
                      Oh yeah?

          The waves crash. Behind them, with no warning at all, a
          train shoots by. Tug stands with his hands jammed in his
          pockets, flashing lights and gleaming metal streaking and
          squealing behind him.
          
          INT. BRENDAN'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          EXT. BACK OF LIBRARY - EARLY MORNING
          A cold gray morning. The Brain hands Brendan a photocopy of
          a newspaper clipping, "LOCAL YOUTH HOSPITALIZED"

                    Frisco Farr was found on a sidewalk
                    outside Pinkerton's Deli three weeks
                    ago. He was in a coma, his stomach
                    contained a sausage sandwich, a horse
                    dose of Heroin and traces of Choleric
                    Tricemate, a poisonous chemical found in
                    laundry detergent. Frisco's still under

                    and nobody's talking, so nothing's come
                    of it.

                              BRENDAN
                    Huh. Bad junk. Bad brick... could that
                    form of Heroin be called 'Brick'?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    No -- it was a concentrated powder, its
                    street handle's 'whip' or 'rock' or
                    'brock'.
                        (fishes a note from his
                         pocket)
                    Here. From Laura.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I told you to stay clear of Laura.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    You tell her to stay clear of me?
          
          He gives the note to Brendan, who unfolds it roughly.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (mutters)
                    I gotta get voicemail.
          
          The note reads "Meet me at the southeast corner of the
          school at 9:30." Brendan crumples it into a ball.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    No. Tell her I'll be at the Pin's at
                    one. Any luck with the lug?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    No.
          
          The Brain lays out a local newspaper with Emily's picture -
          "LOCAL GIRL MISSING". Uncomfortable silence.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    This isn't good.
          
          The Brain looks hard at him. Brendan stares off into space
          for a beat, then takes the Brain's cell phone and dials.
          
                                                                        71
          
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                        (into phone)
                    Mr. Trueman please.
          
          Brendan compares the two notes from his pocket with Laura's
          - distinct handwriting on each.
          
                              TRUEMAN
                        (on the phone)
                    This is Trueman.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What the hell are you doing asking for
                    me in class?
          
                              TRUEMAN
                    What the hell are you doing out of
                    class?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What?
          
                              TRUEMAN
                        (very deliberate)
                    The VP and I needed to ask you a few
                    questions about Emily Kostich, who you
                    might have heard is missing. It's a very
                    serious thing. The police are involved.
                    The VP and I knew you two were close, so
                    the VP and I came to ask you questions,
                    but you were truant. If you don't have a
                    valid excuse-
          
          Brendan hangs up.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    What?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I've been cut loose. I'm not safe here.
                    We shouldn't have met in the open.
                    Alright, lay low, but ask on the
                    underneath for Dode. That's all that
                    matters now, find Dode, but do it on the
                    underneath, got it?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    What are you going to do?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I'd like to have played it safe, but
                    there's no time. The Pin's not letting
          
                                                                         72
          
          
                    anything drop, so I gotta push things a
                    bit.
          
                                THE BRAIN
                    How?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I don't know. Just find Dode.
          
          EXT. THE PIN'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          The bird of prey mailbox looms ominously. Brendan knocks on
          the front door. No answer. He presses lightly on the screen
          door, and it gives.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
          Empty. Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens
          the narrow basement door. He descends into inky gloom.
          
          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
          Deathly still and silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to
          the lit doorway at the end of the hall.
          
          INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME
          
          Empty. Brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the
          Pin's desk.
          
          Slowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it -
          papers and trinkets, meaningless.
          
          He reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his
          knuckles. Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down
          into the desk frame.
          
          Brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches
          thick. He pulls out another. Another. Another. Thumbing the
          stacks -- pure hundreds.
          
          Something creaks in the hallway.
          
          Brendan freezes. Silently he replaces the money and drawer,
          his eyes on the doorway. He creeps towards the door on the
          balls of his feet.
          
          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
          
          Still empty. Brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing
          other doorways, all open but for one. He stops for a moment,
          listening - silence.
          
                                                                         73
          
          
          INT. STORAGE ROOM - SAME
          
          Brendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high
          window. Brendan pulls the curtains aside. A beam of sunlight
          spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark.
          Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror
          jumps as well.
          
          A white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark
          room.
          
          Brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light,
          reflecting it around the room like a flashlight. More junk,
          a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white
          lump in it. The white bird stands behind the lump, its dark
          eyes caught in the bare light.
          
          The bird flies out the window.
          
          Brendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white
          powder. White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there
          were other bricks there before.
          
          Behind Brendan, in the mirror, something moves. Someone
          else, in the room.
          
          Tugger. He throws Brendan across the room, then heaves him
          into a wall.
          
                              TUGGER
                    What with the poking, genius?! Maybe
                    you're poking for your bull friends!
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Don't be a sap. I can't even face up at
                    school, the VP's so hot for me.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah well. Maybe you're looking to make
                    good.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I'm looking to find this big game the
                    Pin's played, not to gum it, but just so
                    when its tail jams in my back I'll know
                    who to bill for the embalming.
          
                              TUGGER
                    You oughta ask him what you wanna know.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I did. He didn't tell me.
          
                                                                 74
          
          
          Tug loosens his grip. Brendan gasps for air.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    When a gee I'm paid to side with won't
                    give me the straight that makes me
                    nervous. Makes me angry.
          
          Tug draws back a bit.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah, well. That's understandable.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Tug sets a country glass of orange juice in front of
          Brendan. He paces.
          
                              TUGGER
                    There was ten of them. I don't know
                    where he picked them, he didn't tell me.
                                 BRENDAN
                           (sympathetic)
                    Huh.
          
                              TUGGER
                    So we get ten kils of brock, there aint
                    enough marks in the whole burgh to eat
                    that. So he unloads eight of em up way
                    north, even up to the docks. I don't
                    know who.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Didn't tell you.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah. That was eight. So that's the
                    tenth in there. We gotta break it into
                    doses, sell em off round the high, maybe
                    some by Shorecliffs.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What about the ninth brick?
          
                              TUGGER
                    Ah yeah. There were problems with that.
          
                                BRENDAN
                    Yeah?
          
                                TUGGER
                    It, uh...
          
                                                                  75
          
          
          He stops, thinking harder than he's used to. His scar
          reddens slightly, then he jerks out of his trance.
          
                              TUGGER (cont'd)
                        (quickly)
                    It disappeared. Someone skimmed it. We
                    started raising hell with all the likely
                    suspects, and whatayaknow, it came back.
                    But it came back bad. One of ours took a
                    dose off the top, and it laid him out.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Frisco.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah, poor Frisco. You heard about that.
                    We'll track down the rat. Just takes
                    time.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I heard something fell with Emily
                    Kostich.
          
                                 TUGGER
                    Emily who?
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Kostich.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Don't know her.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Huh.
          
          A quiet pause. Tug's scar reddens a bit more.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Has the Pin talked about her?
                                 BRENDAN
                    Not to me.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah, he might know something. Ask him.
                    Tell me what he says, cause if you heard
                    something, you know, I wanna check.
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    Sure.
          The screen door swings open -- enter the Pin. If he's
          surprised he doesn't show it.
          
                                                                     76
          
          
                              PIN
                    Pow wowing?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Just shooting the shat.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah, just shooting it.
          
                              PIN
                    Good.
          
          His big foot clunks on the linoleum. He eyes a very sick
          looking Brendan.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    You alright, soldier?
          
          Brendan moves a hand dismissively, sniffling.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    So, Tug, I got a call. Someone who says
                    they know something about Emily.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Emily?
          
                              PIN
                    Emily Kostich. Where she's at now. Says
                    we'd want to know. Wants to meet.
          
                              TUGGER
                        (uncomfortable)
                    Yeah?
          
                              PIN
                    So we'll meet him. Four o'clock.
                        (to Brendan)
                    Emily was Tug's girl for awhile. You
                    know Emily, didn't you?
                              BRENDAN
                    A while back.
          
                              PIN
                    You've heard she's missing?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah, I heard that.
          
                              PIN
                    So maybe you want to come along too.
          
                                                                       77
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What has Emily got to do with you?
          
                              PIN
                        (looks at Tugger)
                    Show, maybe we'll find out.
          
          He gives a slip of paper to Tugger.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    Four o'clock.
          
          Tugger glances at the slip, then slides it to Brendan. It
          has the symbol drawn in pencil:
          
          
          
          
          A horn honks outside.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    That's my ride.
          
          The Pin calls after him as he leaves.
          
                              PIN
                    Four o'clock.
          
          EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - SAME
          
          Brendan falls into Laura's idling car.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (roughly)
                    A payphone, anywhere.
          
                              LAURA
                    What-
          
          Brendan throws the car into drive, and they jerk forward.
          
          EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
          
                              PAYPHONE
                    The mobile customer you have called is
                    away from the phone-
          
          Brendan slams the phone down violently and walks back
          towards the car. His legs quiver, and a coughing fit hits.
          
                                                                        78
          
          
          Hacking and spluttering he falls to his knees. Laura's arms
          wrap around him, except it isn't Laura, it's Emily. Brendan
          spins backwards into
          
          DARKNESS
          
          Emily kissing his mouth, her hair around him, but it isn't
          her hair, it's Laura's. Brendan shoots upwards
          
          INT. LAURA'S CAR STATIONARY - DAY
          
          and sits up with a jolt. Laid out in the back seat, Laura
          dabbing his head with a wet napkin.
          
                               BRENDAN
                         (barks shakily)
                     What time is it?
          
                               LAURA
                     Lie down, Brendan-
                                  BRENDAN
                     What time-
          
                               LAURA
                     You've got a fever, you've got to go to
                     the hospital or-
          
                               BRENDAN
                     What time is it?
          
                               LAURA
                     Three forty. You've got to rest, you're
                     feverish.
          
          He throws himself out of the car.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME
          
          Brendan falls to his knees, coughing. Laura follows.
          
                               LAURA
                     Get back in the car, I'm taking you
                     home, you're sick, you need-
          
                               BRENDAN
                     Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
          
          He keeps yelling that until she does. His head spins.
                               BRENDAN (cont'd)
                     Okay, you've got to, what you've got to
                     do is drive around to the Carrows lot.
          
                                                                         79
          
          
                    I'll be up on the, the blacktop, the
                    basketball field. So you've got to go by
                    you or me to get down there. If you see
                    anyone but the Pin or Tugger or their
                    crew go down into the ravine, honk four
                    times, long short long short. But don't
                    be seen.
          
                              LAURA
                    Get back in the car.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Do it! Will you do it? I need you to do
                    this. I need you, here. Please.
          
          He holds her shoulders. A beat, then her face registers
          resignation.
          
          EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY
          
          A flat plane of pebbly asphalt with a dozen basketball
          courts faintly outlined across its surface. Brendan stands
          crooked, watching the barren horizon. The wind blows
          bitterly, and the sky is dark.
          
          Then, a speck. Coming towards Brendan, across the field.
          Brendan slumps towards it. Closer. Still a dark dot. Closer.
          
          Brendan's face snaps into recognition.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What are you doing, Dode?
          
          Dode grins. He holds a newspaper.
          
                              DODE
                    You gonna stop me?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What do you think you're doing, Dode?
                              DODE
                    I saw you. I saw what you did.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What'd you see?
          
                                 DODE
                    I saw you.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What'd you see me?
          
                                                                     80
          
          
                              DODE
                    You were with her, dead, and you took
                    the body.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah, I did. That's all you saw? What
                    about before?
          
                              DODE
                    Before what?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Did you see who killed her before I got
                    there?
          
                              DODE
                        (face ashen)
                    You killed her.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I found the body, Dode.
          
                              DODE
                    You, I thought you didn't, but we
                    figured out, I got the news on ya, cause
                    you hid the body, why wouldn't-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Who's 'we'?
          
                              DODE
                    Shut up! You're always talking, always
                    this and that smartso, you're gonna shut
                    up now!
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I didn't kill her, Dode.
          
                              DODE
                    You're not going to talk this!
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Dode, I know you're thinking of Em, I
                    know you tried to help her-
          
                              DODE
                    Shut up! You're gonna shut your
          
          Brendan staggers, the world blurs out for a moment, then
          snaps back.
                              DODE (cont'd)
                    put it over real nice-
          
                                                                        81
          
          
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    -so I'm telling you now you're in over
                    your head, you don't want to put your
                    hand in this-
          
          Dode shakes the newspaper at him.
          
                              DODE
                    Shut up! She's dead, you-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Why was she scared, Dode? She came to
                    me, who was she scared of? I think I
                    know why, I just gotta know who!
          
          Dode throws the paper, which scatters in the wind.
                              DODE
                    You're trying to confuse me.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Dode.
          
                              DODE
                    You couldn't stand it. Your little Em.
                    She was gonna keep it, it was mine, and
                    you couldn't stand that.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What was yours?
          
                              DODE
                    I had you pegged.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What was yours?
                              DODE
                    I loved her. And I woulda loved the kid.
                    I'm gonna bury you.
          
          Brendan's face is empty. Dode walks stiffly away. Brendan
          puts a hand on his shoulder, but shrinks back in a coughing
          spasm. Dode grabs Brendan's wrist and hits him in the face.
          Brendan hits the pavement.
          
                                                                         82
          
          
          EXT. HEAVEN - DAY
          
          Bright clouds, sharp light. Emily flies towards us, glowing,
          then dimmer, her wings splutter out, the clouds turn gray,
          and we are looking at Emily's picture in the newspaper
          article.
          
          EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY
          
          Brendan pulls the newspaper off his face, lying in a fetal
          position. Dode is nowhere to be seen.
          
          Slowly, painfully, Brendan hoists himself up. He coughs and
          splutters, barely able to keep his footing.
          
          He limps across the field. Every step is agony. The wind
          blows against him. The black field seems impossibly long,
          still he keeps limping forward, towards the ravine.
          
          EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - DAY
          Brendan slides down the embankment, landing on his feet.
          
          Gathered around the drain tunnel entrance are Tugger, the
          Pin, five of Tugger's flunkies and Dode in the middle.
          Everyone looks at Brendan.
          
          A long silence. Brendan clears his throat.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What'd I miss?
          
          More silence.
          
                              PIN
                    Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead.
          
          Nobody reacts to that. Brendan's face is placid.
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Oh yeah?
          
                              PIN
                    Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He
                    says he knows where the body's at.
                        (beat of silence)
                    And he says he wants more money than I
                    think the information's worth.
                              BRENDAN
                    That so, Dode?
                        (to the Pin)
          
                                                                        83
          
          
                    So walk. What's the info have to do with
                    you anyways?
          
                              DODE
                    Plenty.
          
                              PIN
                    Plenty, he says.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Uh huh. And he wants cash on the nail.
                    He's a pot skulled reef worm with more
                    hop in his head than blood. Why pay for
                    dirt you can't believe?
          
                              DODE
                    You'll believe this.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (shrugs)
                    Maybe you will.
          
                              DODE
                    You'll believe it, cause it's someone
                    close to you. Real close.
          
          The Pin looks up at Brendan, whose face is loose and
          nonchalant.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't
                    trust it.
          
                              DODE
                    Real close.
          
          Tugger's eyes are locked on Dode, his scar the color of raw
          liver. Brendan laughs and turns away.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I'm getting my shoes wet for this. Let
                    him milk you if you want.
          
                              PIN
                        (to Brendan)
                    Stay.
                        (to Dode)
                    It's still too much.
          
                              DODE
                    No it's not. You won't complain when you
                    hear it.
          
                                                                          84
          
          
          Tugger twists a stick in his hands. Brendan watches him,
          curious.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (murmurs)
                    So maybe you should.
          
                              DODE
                    You had her against the wall with the
                    brick -
          
                              PIN
                    I know my business. It's still too much.
          
                              DODE
                        (with growing confidence)
                    It's not, cause that's not why she was
                    killed, and it's real important to you,
                    cause the person who killed her's real
                    close, and cause he's got a lot to lose,
                    and he knows if I don't bury him by
                    spilling to you I spill to the bulls and
                    bury him for real, and he's really
                    really scared - she had a kid in her and
                    he couldn't stand -
          
          Tugger springs like a cat.     He grabs Dode's hair and knees
          his face.
          
          Brendan stumbles towards them.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Tug, it's alright!
          
          Tug has Dode on the ground, kicking his stomach and chest.
          
                                 PIN
                    Tug, stop.
          
          Tug backs off. Dode raises his head.
          
          Tug pulls the gun from his jacket.
          
          Brendan yells, slips and falls into the shallow water.
          
          Tug levels the gun at Dode's head and fires one shot. The
          back of Dode's skull comes off.
          
          The rapport reverberates through the black tunnel behind
          them, and birds fly out. Dode remains upright for a moment,
          then falls limp into the water.
          
                                                                          85
          
          
          The Pin's face is stupid, lifeless. Tug turns to him, gun in
          hand.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                        (thickly)
                    Tug...
          
          Tugger fires - dirt kicks up, and the Pin scrambles back.
          Brendan crawls towards Tug, yelling for him to stop.
          
          Tug fires twice more, both misses, and the Pin is away.
          
          Distant sirens.
          
          Brendan's vision blurs.   He stumbles and falls into the
          shallow water.
          
                                                               FADE OUT
          
                                                               FADE IN:
          A CEILING FAN
          
          Spinning gently. Brendan's eyes open, watch it sleepily,
          then sharpen.
          
          INT. TUGGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Brendan sits up in the bed. Tugger sits in a chair bedside,
          smoking. Brendan watches him for a long moment in the room's
          dim light.
          
                              TUGGER
                    She sprung it on me, just. That's a hell
                    of a thing to spring on a guy. I don't
                    remember much. Laura talked me down
                    after, said whatever, she knew her, said
                    it wasn't true, but I still think
                    sometimes. I think bout it being true.
                    Bout it being mine. And maybe I did it
                    cause I thought it was true. A hell of a
                    thing.
          
          Brendan stares at him through cold, empty eyes.
          
                              TUGGER (cont'd)
                    You up? You weren't doing too good there
                    for awhile. Laura said take you, you
                    know, hospital, but I couldn't.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What's the stats?
          
                                                                        86
          
          
                              TUGGER
                    Everyone's just laying low. You're here
                    with us, at my folks place. They're
                    gone. The bulls got Dode fore the tide
                    took his body.
          
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Tide?
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah, strong tide, would've taken the
                    body, like out to sea. It can do that.
                    But the fuzz got there first.
          
          Brendan nods.
          
                              TUGGER (cont'd)
                    So everyone's assuming it's war, but no
                    one's said it yet. Everyone's lying low.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    War?
          
                              TUGGER
                    You're with us.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    The hell I am.
          
          Brendan swings his legs over the bed. Tug steps in front of
          him, staring him down.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    Alright, I'm with you.
          
                              TUGGER
                    So just lie low. Sleep some more. Laura,
                    she said you should sleep.
          Tugger exits. Brendan runs his fingers through his hair,
          steps into his shoes and hobbles out of the room.
          
          INT. TUGGER'S LIVING ROOM - SAME
          
          About ten more kids dressed like Tug are cleaning guns.
          Brendan nods to them.
                              BRENDAN
                    Hey.
          
                                                                         87
          
          
          They nod back, not paying much attention as he goes out the
          front door.
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          On a lamplit street corner Brendan leans against a payphone.
          
          
          
                              THE BRAIN
                        (on phone)
                    Brendan?
          
                                BRENDAN
                    Yeah.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Are you - what, man, have you heard
                    about Dode-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I was there.

                              BRENDAN
                    Where were you yesterday? I called.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off. I
                    just now got it back.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright, listen-
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Are you okay?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Just listen. Is my name in the papers
                    with the story?
          
                                THE BRAIN
                    No.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright. Is it just Dode in the papers?
                              THE BRAIN
                    Yeah. What do you mean?
          
                                                                        88
          
          
                               BRENDAN
                    Listen, I'm going to be calling you
                    tonight, probably late. Sleep with your
                    phone on. Could you get a car if you
                    needed to?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    If it's late enough I could take my
                    mom's-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Be ready then. I'll call.
          
                               THE BRAIN
                    Alright.
          
          INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Brendan kicks in the door. Kara sits in front of the mirror
          in a soft pink robe, a boy on the floor beside her. She
          gasps.
          
                              KARA
                    Brendan. Did you hear about Dode?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You scheming tramp. You set that poor
                    kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale.
                    You got info from Laura and held Dode
                    like a card till you could play him. For
                    money!
          
          Brendan throws a chair. The boy stands.
          
                              KARA
                    I don't know what you're talking about.
          
                               BRENDAN
                    You'd bury me at the same time, but it
                    was mostly for the money. You got Dode
                    thinking Em had his kid, thinking I did
                    it, and that was enough for him, but he
                    stuck to the money cause you had your
                    claws in him, cause he couldn't come
                    away from the deal without it and make
                    you happy.
          
                              KARA
                    Sit down, you're a mess. Russ, go get my
                    shoes from the wardrobe locker, would
                    you sweetie?
          
                                                                              89
          
          
               He goes, trying to look mean at Brendan. Brendan and Kara
               watch each other like caged rats.
          
                                       KARA (cont'd)
                             Still wish you knew what you wanted to
                             know? If it's any consolation, it
                             probably wasn't Dode's kid. It might
                             have been Tug's, but frankly I wouldn't
                             bet a horse - it was a crowded field
                             there at the end.
          
               Brendan grabs a clock and throws it. Kara's mirror shatters,
               revealing a grimy dark wall behind.
          
                                       KARA (cont'd)
                             Meany. You want my tale, Brendan? I
                             still know what Dode was selling, but
                             I'd play it smart. A quick call from a
                             payphone to copland, they drag the
                             tunnel and you're through.
          
               She comes very close to him. Her robe falls open slightly.
          
                                       KARA (cont'd)
                             Five thousand. Cash. I know you can get
                             it from the Pin, but even if you can't I
                             want it by first period tomorrow, or I
                             play my hand and bury you.
          
               She turns away, lets her robe fall.1
          
                                       KARA (cont'd)
                             Now get out.
          
               Brendan's eyes burn. He lunges at her.
          
               EXT. BACKSTAGE - SAME
          
               Drama geeks sit in groups. The dressing room door flies open
               and Kara flies out, stark naked. Brendan flies out after
               her.
          
                                       KARA
                             What are you doing?
          
                                       BRENDAN
                             Showing your ace.
          
               Brendan storms out.

          EXT. PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Brendan walks past the bird of prey mailbox. A voice from
          the screen door -
          
                               VOICE
                     Far enough.
          
          The Pin.
          
                               PIN
                     Everyone's paying social calls.
          
                               BRENDAN
                     Laura here?
          
          Beat of silence.
          
                               PIN
                     So?
                               BRENDAN
                     So what are the stats?
          
                               PIN
                     The stats are war, soon as the press
                     heat dies. And if you're with him,
                     you're with him.
          
                               BRENDAN
                     Tug got hot. He panicked.

                     Tug's been after my digs from the get

                               BRENDAN
                     No. He's been anxious cause he thought
                     if you found out he killed Emily you'd
                     turn him over.
                               PIN
                     He was right.
          
                               BRENDAN
                     Yeah, well.
          
                               PIN
                     I told him to get the straight, no
                     roughing. I wasn't even there.
          
                                                                91
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright. So he's a hot head. So you
                    don't want him on your side, at least
                    let's have a pow wow fore we start
                    digging trenches. Maybe we can all walk
                    away amiable enemies. What would it
                    take?
          
                              PIN
                    I don't know. We'd have to square
                    everything between us. He owes me some
                    money.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright, but we can talk.
          
                              PIN
                    Yeah, alright.

                    Four o'clock.

                    Tonight. Let's clear it all before it
                    boils up again.

                    Yeah.
          
          Brendan turns away.
          
                                LAURA (OS)
                    Wait!
          She comes out of the house with her purse.
          
                              LAURA (cont'd)
                    I'll drive you back.

          Laura drives, Brendan stares at the passing lights.
                              LAURA
                    What's going to happen?
          
          Brendan coughs.
          
                                                                       92
          
          
                              LAURA (cont'd)
                    Do you feel better?
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (weak)
                    I don't know.
          
          INT. TUGGER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Brendan stumbles in. Tug's hands grab him roughly.
          
                              TUGGER
                    For a smart guy you aint too smart. I
                    said lay low.
          
          Laura enters.
          
                              LAURA
                    Tug.
          
          He drops Brendan. Laura kneels beside Brendan, feeling his
          forehead.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    She was at the Pin's.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah, she's our go-between.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Uh huh. So here's the sit. You and the
                    Pin are going to pow wow, four o'clock
                    tonight, his place. Take all the muscle
                    you want, you won't need it. He wants to
                    talk straight, and you're going to work
                    with him for whatever he needs, cause
                    you don't want war.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Hell I don't.
                              BRENDAN
                    The Pin's sitting on the brick profits -
                    hitting him now would be post. Make
                    peace and wait for your chance.
          
                              LAURA
                    He's right, Tug. Smooth it out.
          
                                                                         93

                        (between coughs)
                    Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing.
                    War'll mean you vs. him and every bull
                    in the burgh.
          
          Tugger turns away, thinking.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Yeah, we'll talk.
          
                               LAURA
                        (to Brendan)
                    You going?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Yeah.
          
          She nods. Brendan stumbles into the bedroom.
          
          INT. TUGGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Brendan lies on his back. Sweat stands on his forehead.
          
          THE FAN
          
          Spinning dizzily from Brendan's POV. Then the fan is still
          and the room is spinning, then the fan, then the room.
          Brendan clamps his eyes shut. A door creaks open.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (croaks)
                    Go away.
          
          Laura floats across the room to him. Her hair falls around
          him. Brendan shrinks back. She puts a pale hand on his
          clammy forehead. Brendan tries to speak, but cannot.
          
          He fingers slide over his face. She pulls off his glasses.
          
          Her hands all over his face. Brendan's throat contorts in a
          hard swallow. His eyes are wet.
          
          Her hair, her hands all warm and gentle, touching him.
          
                              LAURA
                    I'm sorry Brendan.
          
          Brendan breaks. In silent sobs first, then shivering with an
          almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms.
          
          THE FAN
          
                                                                        94
          
          
          Spinning above them.
          
          Laura lights a cigarette. They lie beside each other.
          
                              LAURA
                    Don't go tonight.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I've got to make sure it plays out
                    smooth.
          
                              LAURA
                    It'll play however it plays without you
                    there.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I've got to make sure.
          
                                 LAURA
                    Why?
                              BRENDAN
                    Cause if there's war, I'm in it too.
          
                              LAURA
                    Well let's just, I mean why not just run
                    away. Go somewhere. I've got a car.
                        (Brendan gives a wry look)
                    I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she
                    wouldn't care.
                        (Brendan grins)
                    Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think
                    about it, why not? What, school? C'mon.
                    Family?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright, stop.
          
          Her smoke drifts into the fan.
                              LAURA
                    I wasn't serious, but we could go for
                    awhile. Just until everything clears.
          
          Brendan watches the smoke. She stubs the butt out in an ash
          tray on the table and curls against his chest.
          
          Stretching his arm across the table, he nonchalantly spins
          the ash tray around with his finger.
          
          His glasses lay on the table. Through the left lens the
          cigarette is magnified. Pale blue arrow on the filter.
          
                                                                         95
          
          
          Laura's arm stretches across his chest. He looks at it, then
          up at the fan, spinning.
          
          LATER
          
          Brendan slips out of bed. A glowing clock radio reads
          "3:16".

          A swarm of silent activity. Tug's flunkies prepare various
          weapons. Brendan goes to Tug.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Tell your boys no knuckle business.
          
                              TUGGER
                    They're just ready.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Your folks left a car here?
                                TUGGER
                    Yeah.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Take it and Laura's.
                        (Brendan tosses Tug the keys)
                    I'll go first in yours.
          
                                TUGGER
                    The hell-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I'll take the scenic route to draw off
                    any tailers. They'll think it's you,
                    they might even radio back that you're
                    alone. Get it?
          
                              TUGGER
                    Mr. Smarts.
          
          He tosses Brendan his keys.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright. Got a cigarette?
          
                              TUGGER
                    No. I don't smoke.
                              BRENDAN
                    I've seen you smoke.
          
                                                                         96
          
          
                              TUGGER
                    I don't smoke cigarettes.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Give me fifteen minutes, then go.
          
          EXT. TUGGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Brendan slides into the black mustang and gutters off into
          the night.
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Overlooking a twinkling valley of suburban lights. Brendan
          talks at a payphone beside the curbed mustang.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                        (on phone)
                    Yeah.
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright, I warned you. Can you get the
                    car?
          
                                THE BRAIN
                    Yeah.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La
                    Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura's
                    inside. She hasn't got a car, but if she
                    blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her.
                    Alright?
                        (silence)
                    Alright?
          
                                THE BRAIN
                    Okay.
                              BRENDAN
                    I'll call you when it gets light.
                        (silence)
                    Thanks, Brain.
          
          CLICK, Brain hangs up.
          
          EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Brendan pulls the mustang into the driveway, limps up to the
          front door and knocks. One of the Pin's boys lets him in.
          
                                                                         97
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
          Crowded with tense looking punks, half dressed like the Pin
          and half like Tugger. The Pin's mom is shuffling about,
          pouring them milk.
          
          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
          
          Several more punks from both camps crowd the hall, and more
          lean in the darkened doorways. Brendan passes through
          quickly.
          
          INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME
          
          The Pin at his desk, flanked by two of his boys. Tug sits in
          the center of the room, two of his punks beside him. Brendan
          saunters between them and leans against the dresser.
          
                                BRENDAN
                    Talk.
                              PIN
                    I want full assurance that any heat from
                    Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you.
                    I don't even want my name pulled in the
                    shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no
                    rush, but I want your shake that it'll
                    come home in not too much time.
          
          Tug's eyes burn, his scar reddens.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (to Tug)
                    That's square. You did them after all.
                    Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this,
                    one of you'll dish it to bury the other
                    and you'll both get the rap. As to the
                    six, did you borrow it?
          
                                TUGGER
                    Yeah.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Then you owe it. Shouldn't need a shake
                    on that.
          
          Tug looks at the Pin.
          
                              TUGGER
                    Alright to both.
          
                                                               98
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Good. Let's seal it up and blow for
                    keeps.
          
                              PIN
                    Third thing. The last brick.
          
          Brendan looks up sharply, taken off guard.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    It's yours.
          
                              PIN
                    That aint the point. I'm gonna start
                    selling it. How do I know it aint bad?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Why would it be?
          
                              PIN
                    Why was the last one? Cause someone got
                    greedy. Tug here's had the means to
                    swipe half and cut it bad for a long
                    time. Now we're splits my loss of
                    trust's retroactive.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Did you, Tug?
          
                                TUGGER
                          (eyes hot on the Pin)
                    No.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright, so let's shake and blow.
          
                              PIN
                    Not good enough.
          
          Tug shoots to his feet, kicking away his chair.
                              BRENDAN
                    What would be good enough?
          
                              PIN
                    I wanna see him dose it. Just to prove
                    it. Then we're square.
          
                               TUGGER
                    Hell for that! I didn't touch your junk,
                    that's it.
          
                                                                         99
          
          
                               PIN
                     I wanna see it.
          
                                TUGGER
                     To hell!
          
                               PIN
                     Your not wanting to dose it's telling me
                     something right here.
          
                               TUGGER
                     Yeah, it better be! It's telling that
                     I'm out from your thumb, that I aint
                     playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple
                     no more!
          
          Everyone in the room is on their feet.   Brendan steps
          forward.
          
                               BRENDAN
                     I'll dose it.
          
          All eyes to him, unbelieving.
          
                                PIN
                     What?
          
                               BRENDAN
                     If it'll shut you two apes up I'll   take
                     the dose, and if I don't die we're   all
                     right as rain, and if I do die you   two
                     have your war, so long as you keep   it
                     off my grave. Deal?
          
                                PIN
                     Fine.   Tangles.
          
                               BRENDAN
                     Johnny, go with him.
          They go.
          
          Tug just stares at Brendan, then tosses his hands up
          slightly and turns away.
          
          They all wait.
          
          CRASH! from the next room. Everyone freezes. More breaking,
          then scuffling and shouting.
          
          The two punks look at their bosses, then run out. Tug starts
          to follow, but Brendan holds him back.
          
                                                                        100
          
          
          The noise through the wall grows tremendous, a full brawl.
          The ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies
          hitting the ground.
          
          Then, from not too far away, a gunshot.
          
          The Pin stands and goes towards the door, but Brendan shouts
          
                               BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    No!
          
          and slams it shut. A few tense seconds.
          
          Another gunshot. Footfalls, then Tangles falls through the
          door, his chest red. The Pin bends over him.
          
                              TANGLES
                        (gasping)
                    The brick, it's gone. The brick's gone.
          
          Tangles stops gasping.
          The Pin stands, eyes blazing at Tug.
          
                              PIN
                    Make peace, huh? Talk it out? Get your
                    boys in my den soes you could snag it
                    under my nose?
          
          Tug's scar is fiery red. He coils his body, snarling.
          
                               TUGGER
                    Alright!
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No, that's not-
          
                              PIN
                    Was it bad, Tug? Snag it so I don't
                    know, or sell it off to flat the war
                    odds?
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (shouts)
                    Pin, think about it-
          
                              TUGGER
                    Alright, I did all that!
          Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into
          the ground with his fist. He punctuates his words with hard
          straight blows into the Pin's face.
          
                                                                          101
          
          
                              TUGGER (cont'd)
                    I cut the brick, I stole the money, I
                    faked a peace, I snagged your junk, I
                    did it all!
          
          He pulls the gun.
          
          Brendan shouts and throws himself on Tug's arm, wrenching it
          sideways. The gun clunks onto the carpet.
          
          The Pin flips Tug   over and for a moment Brendan is caught
          between them, hit   and torn, rolling over the gun. Tug grabs
          it, Brendan grabs   his wrist and the gun goes off, firing
          into the ceiling.   Plaster sprays.
          
          Brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out
          of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two.
          
          The Pin is on top, pinning Tug's gun hand to the carpet,
          straining to keep it there.
          
          Brendan leaps to his feet, staggers, then winds up and kicks
          Tug in the wrist with all his strength.
          
          A terrible crunching popping sound. Tug roars. Brendan takes
          the gun from his limp hand.
          
                                PIN
                    Do him!
          
          Brendan backs off a few steps. The Pin strains to keep Tug
          down.
          
                              PIN (cont'd)
                    Do him now!
          
          Brendan stumbles back. Tug roars, flips the Pin over and
          beats his face mercilessly.
          
          Brendan stumbles out into the hall.
          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
          
          Empty. From the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling
          relentless sounds of fighting.
          
          Brendan walks backwards as if in a trance, eyes glued to the
          Pin's door. Inside wild shadows splay across the walls, and
          the Pin shouts Brendan's name.
          Light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall
          beside Brendan splinters. Brendan spins on his heel and
          fires three shots into the darkness, which falls silent.
          
                                                                        102
          
          
          He turns the gun back on the Pin's doorway.
          
          With a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark. They broke
          the lamp.
          
          The dark doorway looms up before Brendan, inky black.
          Horrible sounds come from it, blows, breaking bone, screams.
          The Pin screams Brendan's name over and over, calling for
          help. Pleading. Brendan steps back.
          
          Time slows down. Brendan drops the gun.
          
          It thunks on the carpet.
          
          In one motion Brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the
          Pin's doorway, turns and runs into the room where he found
          the brick.
          
          INT. STORAGE ROOM
          
          Dark. Brendan runs through, clawing past dark fighting
          shapes, running like a man possessed. He breaks through the
          darkness and heaves himself up through the small window.
          
          EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Brendan scrambles out, slips on the grass and hits the
          ground hard.
          
          Two sharp gunshots come from the house.
          
          Everything is suddenly still. Brendan stands slowly.
          
          He notices a light from the Mustang - the trunk has drifted
          open.
          
          Inside, a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic. Blue
          fingernails. Cheap plastic bracelets.
          
          Brendan shuts the trunk solidly, then walks off down the
          street and vanishes into the inky night.
          
          A moment later police cars pull up, sirens blaring, lights
          turning the dark streets bright as day.
          
                                                                 FADE OUT
          
                                                                 FADE IN:
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PAYPHONE - EARLY MORNING
          
          The morning is cold and clammy. Brendan slumps against the
          payphone.
          
                                                                        103
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Hey. Where are you?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                        (on phone)
                    Library. Where are you?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Did she blow last night?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    No. Stayed there till six thirty, then
                    walked to school.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You didn't give her a ride, did you?
          
                               THE BRAIN
                    No.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    But she came straight to school from
                    Tug's?
          
                               THE BRAIN
                    Yeah.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    She there now?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Yeah. Not with me, but here.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright. Tell her I wanna meet up on the
                    basketball field in half an hour, then
                    go home and get some sleep.
          
                               THE BRAIN
                    Alright.
          Brendan hangs up, then pauses, lost in thought.
          
          EXT. SIDE OF GYM - LATER
          
          Brendan sits against the massive gym building, writing on a
          piece of looseleaf paper.
          
          EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - LATER
          Brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled "VP Offices".
          
                                                                     104
          
          
          EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - LATER
          
          Cold, barren. Wind whistles softly and jangles the metal
          mesh basketball nets like windchimes.
          
          Brendan stands crookedly, hands in pockets, eyes trained on
          the cold black horizon. A speck appears. Brendan waits for
          it, bracing himself against the wind.
          
          Laura. She puts her arms around him, a warm embrace. Brendan
          draws back.
          
                               LAURA
                         (softly)
                    Did you see it all? With Tug and the
                    Pin?
          
          Brendan looks at her a moment.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No. I took your advice and didn't go.
          
                                 LAURA
                           (confused)
                    No?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    What happened?
          
          Laura looks at him strangely, a little uneasy.
          
                              LAURA
                    The papers say six dead, three around
                    the house, one girl in the trunk of
                    Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug.
          
          Brendan's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown.
          
                                BRENDAN
                    Yeah?
                              LAURA
                    Tug tried to shoot his way out when the
                    police got there. They tied him to Dode,
                    too. Same gun. And the girl.
          
                                BRENDAN
                    Huh.
                              LAURA
                    Well good thing you weren't there.
          
                                                               105
          
          
                                BRENDAN
                    Yeah.
          
          Laura's face softens a bit.
          
                              LAURA
                    You think the girl was Emily?
          
                                BRENDAN
                    Probably.
          
          Laura embraces him again, and doesn't let go.
          
                              LAURA
                    You loved her.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (distant)
                    Yeah I did.
          
                              LAURA
                    You did all this cause you loved her.
                    And now it's finished.
                        (tightens her embrace)
                    I love you.
          
                                BRENDAN
                    No.
          
          Laura pulls back, looks at his face. It is a mask.
          
                                LAURA
                    What?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    No, it's not finished. Tug pulled the
                    trigger on Em and he got the fall, but
                    the bulls coulda found that out without
                    me.
          Laura pulls back more.
          
                              BRENDAN (cont'd)
                    I set out to know who put her in the
                    spot, who put her in front of the gun.
                    That was you, angel.
          
                              LAURA
                        (drifting back further)
                    What are you talking about?
          
                                                               106
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    It was you. What, you want the whole
                    tale? You want me to tell it to you?
          
                              LAURA
                        (bewildered)
                    Tell it to me.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Alright, from the top. You had your
                    fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances
                    and to keep him buying from the Pin, who
                    you were hooked with. Emily came to you
                    and Brad, you saw her for what she was,
                    an insecure little girl trying to get
                    in. She goes on the backburner.
                    Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored,
                    maybe just greedy, so when the Pin
                    scores big with the bricks you take your
                    shot. You hook one, take half, and cut
                    it back to size, but you cut it bad.
                    Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the
                    Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put
                    it back, but poor Frisco doses off it
                    and lands in a coma.
                        (voice strengthening)
                    So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's
                    jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's
                    crowd looking for blood, or at least a
                    scape. You know trouble. There's going
                    to be a war over this. And there's
                    Emily. She trusts you. She wants in.
                    It's duck soup.
          
                                LAURA
                          (murmurs)
                    No.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You frame her for the bad brick, then
                    you cut her loose. You turn on your heel
                    and bite her in the throat. Last week on
                    the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she
                    saw something she was scared of. Tug's
                    car driving by, the Pin driving, but she
                    wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was
                    across the street, angel. She saw the
                    passenger side. She saw you. She saw you
                    and ran like she saw some devil.
          
          Laura's face is very still, quivering.
          
                                                                        107
          
          
                              LAURA
                    Brendan, why are you-
          
                              BRENDAN
                    And she took the hit. Dode hid her away,
                    but the Pin was on to her, tracked her
                    down, told her to meet him, that they
                    would make good. Gave her a time, and a
                    place. And sent Tug. Just to get the
                    straight. But maybe you had talked Tug
                    up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em
                    sprung it on him that she had her kid,
                    and he did what anyone could count on
                    Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit
                    for you. You let her take it.
          
                                LAURA
                    Stop it!
          
                              BRENDAN
                    That's the tale.
          
                                LAURA
                    Stop it!
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You're going to tell me it's not?
          
          
          
                                LAURA
                    It's not!
          
                              BRENDAN
                    Look at me.
          
          She crumples against him, looking him straight in the eye.
          
                              LAURA
                    You know me. I've only helped you. How
                    can you - It isn't true!
          
          She sobs through a tensed, straight face. Brendan holds her
          stare, but his eyes are distant.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    I hope it isn't. I want you to have been
                    on my side all along, not just trying to
                    get me under your thumb like Brad and
                    the Pin and Tug.
          
                                LAURA
                    No-
          
                                                                       108
          
          
                              BRENDAN
                    But I think you knew that meeting was
                    going to blow up. I think that was your
                    final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope
                    everything I wrote in the note I dropped
                    at Gary Trueman's office this morning is
                    wrong. About your and Brad's involvement
                    in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't
                    steal the brick last night. In your
                    purse.
          
                              LAURA
                        (breathes)
                    I didn't.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    That's good. That means you didn't let
                    me walk into a slaughterhouse. You
                    didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their
                    crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman
                    reads the note, takes my cue and
                    searches your locker, he won't find a
                    damn thing.
          
          Something changes in Laura's eyes.
          
          EXT. LOCKER CAGE - INSERT
          
          Trueman and several other men force Laura's locker open.
          From its dark interior the chalky white brick falls out,
          spins through the air, and shatters silently on the locker
          cage floor.
          
          EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - SAME
          
          A moment of silence between them. The basketball nets
          jangle.
          
          Laura steps back. She looks as if she has been punched in
          the face.
          
                              LAURA
                        (murmurs)
                    Brendan... don't...
          
                               BRENDAN
                        (gently)
                    It's done.
          
          Her face does strange things, subtle contortions.
          She watches his eyes. He doesn't look at her. Her voice
          shakes.
          
                                                                        109
          
          
                              LAURA
                    Done. Well. That's most of it. 9 out of
                    10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his.
                    Told her it would soften him up. She
                    said she wished she could keep it, but
                    she didn't love the father. I was going
                    to drive her down the next day, we'd
                    found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was
                    starting to show. 3 months. You know
                    whose kid that makes it, or have you
                    known all along?
          
          Slowly, steadily, she straightens up. Her figure takes back
          some dignity. She steps towards him deliberately. Closer.
          Right up against him.
          
          She brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear,
          breathes warm breath, and says two words. The first is
          
                                 LAURA (cont'd)
                    Mother-
          
          the second is low, guttural and lost to the whistling wind.
          
          She turns and walks briskly away.
          
          Brendan watches her go across the dark, barren field of
          asphalt.
          
          Metal jangles. Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a
          chain link fence. Brendan turns his eyes back on Laura.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    You get your straight?
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Yeah. I wouldn't have-
          
                                 BRENDAN
                    S'alright.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Yeah, well. Chuck Burns came to. The
                    knife guy. Spilled it all to the bulls,
                    guess Brad Bramish hired him. On his
                    own, just a grudge thing.
          
                              BRENDAN
                        (nods slightly)
                    Fits. You did good, Brain. Go sleep.
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Yeah, you too.
          
                                                                       110
          
          
          The Brain starts to walk away, but turns back.
          
                              THE BRAIN (cont'd)
                    What'd she whisper to you?
          
                              BRENDAN
                    She called me a dirty word.
          
          
                              THE BRAIN
                    Alright, you don't have to tell me.
                    Thick.
          
                              BRENDAN
                    As what-all.
          
          
           Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching
           Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks
           off behind a twisted chain linked fence.
          
          
           The first period bell rings, and Brendan walks back
           towards campus.
          
                                                           FADE OUT.
BURIED

                         FADE IN:

          INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT

          Darkness. Silence. After a long beat, we hear movement,
          confined and contained.
          We then hear the sound of a man, PAUL CONROY, groaning,
          making confused attempts at words. We hear his movement;
          short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with the
          sound of his body banging against wood.
          He screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mouth
          is covered by something.
          After attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head
          against something. It's terribly warm and his breaths are
          labored.
          He attempts to move to his left and right, only to find that
          he is confined on those sides, as well. He frantically
          shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is encased
          in something.
          Something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to know
          that.
          Finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the Zippo he holds
          in his hands, which are bound together in front of him with
          rope. A rolled-up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his
          head, stretched across his mouth. Dried blood stains his
          hair and forehead.

                         
          We see that he is lying in an old fashioned, wooden coffin.
          Nothing more than a few rotted-out planks of wood nailed
          together. Realizing the same, Paul is struck by an
          overwhelming, instant panic.
          With great difficulty, and while still holding the lit Zippo,
          Paul removes the muzzle from his mouth.

                          PAUL
           What...? What is this?
          His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about,
          though fear is understood in his every utterance.
          He screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the coffin
          walls.

           2.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Oh my God! Help me!! Help me!!
          He kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of the
          coffin, all to no avail. His violent movements cause small
          grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the
          sides and top of the coffin, as well as a small gap that
          exists between one of the coffin's broken wooden planks.
          Sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from his
          dampened brow. The heat inside the extremely close confines
          of the coffin is stifling.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Somebody help me! Please!!
          Paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of
          the coffin. The sides, the top, the bottom -- all are too
          thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the
          coffin. Sand. It becomes clear to him that he is buried.
          He tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble
          catching his breath. It takes him some time, but he
          eventually achieves some semblance of calm.
          Getting a good look at him for the first time, we see that
          Paul is somewhere around 37 years old. Unshaven and
          physically unremarkable, he embodies the blue-collar American
          everyman.
          He coughs. The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes
          it hard for him to breathe.
          His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail. He
          tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old,
          frayed ropes that bind his hands. Doing so is no easy task.
          The incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly
          impossible.
          After a lengthy struggle, the rope snaps. Paul quickly frees
          his hands. A small victory. Very small.
          The heat is unbearable. Paul takes off his button-down
          shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt. His body battles against
          the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he
          makes.
          He tosses his button-down shirt down by his feet. His
          undershirt is drenched through with sweat.
          Still trying to calm himself, but having little success in
          doing so, Paul looks around the coffin. His feet, though
          only his body-length away, seem miles from him.

           3.

                         

                         
          He looks at the top of the coffin, and then back at his feet.
          With great difficulty, he shifts his body so that his feet
          are pressed against the top of the coffin. He attempts to
          use his leg strength to push the top off of him, but it
          doesn't move even a millimeter.
          After several failed attempts, and with his legs exhausted,
          Paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin. He lay for a
          moment in silence, followed by an outburst of crying.
          Close to his head, on the corner of the floor, we see there's
          another broken plank. A small hole.
          He closes his cigarette lighter, extinguishing the flame. In
          total darkness, he continues to cry.

                         

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What is this?
          With his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows
          eerily silent.
          The sound of Paul's labored breaths are all we hear, softened
          under the blanket of absolute darkness.
          After a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing
          sound. The muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers in
          the coffin, by Paul's feet. He is extremely startled.
          The buzzing continues, as does the minimal splashing of
          light. It's coming from underneath his discarded button-down
          shirt, down near his feet.
          He lights the Zippo to get a better look.

                         
          Pulling the shirt away, he realizes that what he is hearing
          and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an
          older model cell phone.
          He frantically reaches for it, though the coffin is far too
          small for him to reposition himself so easily.
          To his dismay, the phone stops ringing. But, his efforts to
          reach it continue. He uses his feet to search for the phone.
          After some trouble finding it, he eventually locates it.
          Clamping the phone together between his clasped feet, Paul
          then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet
          with his hands and grab it.
          He is soon able to reach it. Immediately thereafter, he
          flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him.

           4.

                         

                         
          We see that there is a Text Message waiting for Paul on the
          phone. However, Paul barely notices.
          The time on the phone reads 6:12pm. While the numbers and
          display screen icons are familiar to Americans, all the words
          are in Arabic.
          What he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of
          signal strength. Worse yet, there is only half of the
          battery life remaining.
          He tries to remember the Safe Number he was given. With the
          phone open and ready to be dialed, Paul struggles to recall
          the information.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Come on, come on. What was it?

                         
          Getting only two digits into dialing the number, he cannot
          remember much more and closes the phone.
          He wedges the lit Zippo into sand, which is compacted against
          a small hole in the wall of the coffin.
          Paul reaches into his pants pocket, frantically searching for
          something. He hastily removes a prescription pill bottle and
          a small, metal flask. Both are not what he was looking for.
          He then reaches to his back pocket and removes his wallet.
          It's empty. His license, his credit cards, his cash and,
          most importantly at that very moment, a piece of paper with
          the Safe Number written on it, are all missing.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           No. Where the hell is it? Son of
           a...Come on!

                         
          He screams aloud again, hoping greatly that someone can hear
          him. His frenzied maneuvering puts out the flame of the
          Zippo.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Help me! Please! Somebody help
           me!
          His words barely make it pass the coffin walls.
          With the cell phone still in hand, and laboring to reclaim
          the breath he just expended, Paul turns to desperation. He
          dials the international code of 001, and then dials 911.
          A FEMALE 911 OPERATOR answers almost immediately.

           5.

                         

                         

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
           911, please hold.
          The Female 911 Operator places Paul on hold.

                          PAUL
           No! Wait!
          Paul accidentally bangs the cap of the Zippo against the
          coffin wall, putting out the flame.
          She quickly returns.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
           911. What is your emergency?

                          PAUL
           Hello?

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
           911. What's the problem, sir?
          Paul is so incredibly panicked that he has trouble remaining
          coherent. After a few sparks, the Zippo is re-lit.

                          PAUL
           I'm buried. You have to help me.
           You have to help me, I can't
           breathe...

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR

                          SIR --

                          PAUL
           I'm buried in a coffin. Please
           help me! Send someone to find
           me...

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
           Sir...slow down. What is your
           name?

                          PAUL
           Paul. Paul Conroy.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
           Okay, Mister Conroy. Can you tell
           me your location?

                          PAUL
           I don't know. I'm in a coffin. I
           don't know where. I'm scared.
           Please help me.

           6.

                         

                         

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          You're in a coffin?

                          PAUL
          Yeah, it's, like, one of those old,
          wooden ones.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          Are you at a funeral home?

                          PAUL
          No. I don't know. No.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          How are calling me right now?

                          PAUL
          What?

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          If you're buried in a coffin, where
          are you calling from?

                          PAUL
          A cell phone. There was an old
          cell phone in the coffin.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          You're calling from your cell
          phone?

                          PAUL
          Yes. No. It's not mine, but yes,
          I'm calling from a cell phone.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          There was a cell phone in the
          coffin when you climbed in?

                          PAUL
          I didn't climb in.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          How did you end up in the coffin,
          sir?

                          PAUL
          I was put here.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          In the coffin?

                          PAUL
          Yes. Please send help.

           7.

                         

                         

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          And you're saying the coffin is
          buried?

                          PAUL
          I think so. It's...it's hot in
          here. I can't breathe.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          Do you know your location, sir?

                          PAUL
          I told you, I don't know.
          Somewhere in Iraq.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          Iraq?

                         

                          PAUL
          Yes. I'm a truck driver, an
          American. I work for CRT.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          Are you a soldier, sir?

                          PAUL
          No. Please, please listen to me.
          I'm a truck driver. I work for
          CRT. I'm a civilian contractor
          working in Iraq. We were attacked
          in Baqubah, they...they...

                          (STARTS CRYING)
          ...shot them. All of them.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          They shot who, sir?

                         

                          PAUL
          All of the other drivers.

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          And you're saying this happened in
          Iraq? The country?

                          PAUL
          Yes. Please, you have to help me.
          They gave me a safety number to
          call, but I had it stored in my
          wallet and --

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
          Mister Conroy, this is 911
          emergency in Youngstown, Ohio.

           8.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Ohio?

                          FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
           Yes, sir. I'm not sure exactly how
           you called here if you're in
           another country, but if you'd like,
           I can patch you through to the
           Sheriff's Department.

                          PAUL
           Sheriff's Department? No...you
           don't underst...

                          (GIVING UP)
           ...forget it.
          Realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and useless,
          Paul ends the call. He checks the battery life on the phone.
          It still holds steady at two bars.
          He immediately dials another number, one that he can recall
          with ease.
          He again enters the 001 international code before making the
          call.
          Paul then dials his home phone. It rings several times, so
          far unanswered.

                          PAUL
           Come on, come on. Pick up.
           Please.
          After sitting through the agony of a few more rings, Paul is
          met with the answering machine.

                         
          The voice of his young son, SHANE, is heard on the answering
          machine greeting.

                          SHANE
           Thanks for calling the Conroy's.
           We're not home right now. Please
           leave a message at the beep.
           Thanks.
          At the sound of the Beep, Paul leaves a frenzied, rambling
          message.

                          PAUL
           Linda, honey, it's me. Listen, I
           need you to contact the National
           Guard right away. Or the Pentagon.
           Tell them we were attacked in the
           Diyala Provence, in Baqubah.

                          (MORE)

           9.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           They have to find me. Please help
           me, baby. Please help them find me.
          Paul hangs up. He dials his wife's cell phone right away.
          After several rings, her cell phone voice mail picks up. We
          hear the sound of Linda, Paul's wife, on her outgoing
          message.

                          LINDA
           Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a
           message. Thanks and have a great
           day.
          The Beep sounds and Paul immediately tears into his voice
          message.

                         

                          PAUL
           Linda, it's Paul. I need you to
           call me right away. This is an
           absolute emergency. Call the
           number that comes up on your phone.
           Call me at that number. If I don't
           answer, call the Pentagon or the
           F.B.I. I don't know what the hell
           is going on, but I'm buried in a
           box...
          Hearing himself say those last words gives him pause. The
          gravity of the situation fully takes hold.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           ...I can't breathe in here. Make
           sure you call me right away.
           Please, baby, please call me.

                         
          Paul ends the call. He nervously looks at the amount of
          battery life remaining on the phone. Still holding strong at
          two bars.
          He notices the flickering light of the Zippo. It, too,
          appears to be using up small amounts of oxygen. He closes
          the lid, extinguishing the flame.
          Total darkness. Silence, save for Paul's increasingly heavy
          breaths.
          He begins to hyperventilate. He knows that preserving oxygen
          is paramount, so he does his best to calm himself. The
          healthy swig he takes from his flask helps.

           10.

                         

                         
          He flips open the cell phone. The light of the display
          screen partially illuminates his face and some of the coffin
          with a blueish hue. Paul again enters the overseas dialing
          code, this time dialing 411 information.
          The 411 OPERATOR answers.

                          411 OPERATOR
           What city and state, please?

                          PAUL
           Um...I don't know. The F.B.I.,
           wherever they are.
          Paul reaches for his button-down shirt. Fishes for pens
          stashed in his lapel pocket, while keeping the phone pressed
          to his ear with his shoulder.

                         

                          411 OPERATOR
           Do you have a specific city you'd
           like to be connected to, sir?

                          PAUL
           I don't care, any city. Just
           connect me to the F.B.I.

                          411 OPERATOR
           Sir, I have F.B.I. field offices
           listed in Boston, New York,
           Philadelphia, New Haven, Los
           Angeles, Chicago, Denver --
          Paul cannot bear to listen any further to this list that
          seemingly never ends.

                          PAUL
           Anywhere! Any city, just connect
           me, please!

                          411 OPERATOR
           I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not allowed
           to do that.

                          PAUL
           Fine, um...Chicago. Okay?

                          411 OPERATOR
           Please hold for your number.
          Paul is transferred to an AUTOMATED MESSAGE.

                          AUTOMATED MESSAGE
           The number you requested, 312-421-

           6700...

           11.

                         

                         
          Paul writes the digits of the phone number on the top of the
          coffin with his pen. But, after the first three numbers, the
          pen stops working. He hurriedly reaches back into his shirt
          pocket to remove the other pen, which is actually a click-up
          pencil. Click-click-click-click. He writes the last seven
          digits, followed by the word "FBI."

           AUTOMATED MESSAGE (CONT'D)
           ...can be connected for an
           additional charge of twenty-five
           cents by pressing the number one.
          He presses the number one and is connected directly.
          After a few rings, SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS answers.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Chicago field office. Special
           Agent Harris.

                          PAUL
           Hello? Is this the F.B.I.?

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Yes it is, sir.

                          PAUL
           I'm calling from Iraq. I'm buried
           in the desert somewhere. I need
           you to help me --

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Whoa, whoa, sir. Slow down. When
           were you in Iraq?

                          PAUL
           Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck
           driver for CRT. I've been here for
           nine months.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           May I have your name please, sir?

                          PAUL
           Paul Conroy.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           (saying it as he writes it

                          DOWN)
           Paul Conroy.
           (back on the phone)
           Okay, Paul, explain to me what's
           going on.

           12.

                         

                         
          Paul attempts to center himself so that he can accurately
          tell his story.

                          PAUL
           Alright. Me and a convoy of other
           drivers were delivering kitchen
           parts to a community center. As we
           got closer, a bunch of kids started
           throwing rocks at our trucks. Then
           an IED went off up ahead and blew
           up one of the other trucks. These
           guys came out from behind the
           houses with guns and started
           shooting everybody right there on
           the street.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Were you shot at?

                          PAUL
           I don't know!
           (after a breath, calmer)
           I don't know. I was way in the
           back of the convoy. I must have got
           hit in the head with one of the
           rocks and got knocked out. That's
           the last thing I remember. But now
           I just woke up, and I was tied up
           and buried in a coffin.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Who put you there?

                          PAUL
           I guess whoever ambushed us.

                         
          Special Agent Harris sounds slightly skeptical of Paul's
          claims.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           A bunch of kids?

                          PAUL
           No, you're not listening. The kids
           threw the rocks at us, but then
           some Iraqi guys -- maybe
           insurgents, I don't fucking know --
           popped out of nowhere and started
           shooting at us.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           I thought you said they didn't
           shoot at you.

           13.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           They didn't, I don't know! But
           they shot them!

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Sir, you're going to have to stop
           shouting if --

                          PAUL
           I'm shouting because you're not
           listening! I need you to help me!
           Please!!

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Hmmm...
          Paul takes a moment to center himself.

                         

                          PAUL
           Can you trace my call? GPS or
           something?

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Why is it that they didn't shoot
           you?

                          PAUL
           I have no idea. They didn't,
           that's all I know.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           What's your social security number,
           Paul?

                          PAUL
           Why? Who cares? I'm buried in the
           middle of the fucking desert! Who
           cares what my social security
           number is?! I'm an American
           citizen. Just send someone to find
           me!

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Do you know where you're
           ...lo...if...dy..
          The cell phone starts breaking up.

                          PAUL
           Hello? What? I can't hear you.

           SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
           Bet...un...near...

           14.

                         

                         
          Suddenly, Special Agent Harris is not heard at all.

                          PAUL
           Hello?! Hello?!
          Paul checks the phone's display, where he sees that the call
          has been lost.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Shit!!
          Cell phone service temporarily goes down. Paul lights the
          Zippo to help him see the cell phone screen. He tries to
          make a call, but nothing happens.
          He shakes the phone, moves it around the coffin, all in
          desperate hope that he will get a signal. He soon does.

                         
          He looks at the number for the F.B.I. that he has written on
          the wall, thinking about calling them back. He then checks
          the battery life on his phone, which remains at two bars.
          Paul then decides to make a different call, this time to a
          phone number he has committed to memory: his employer back in
          the U.S., Crestin, Roland and Thomas (CRT).
          He closes the lid of the Zippo, extinguishing the flame.
          After a few rings, a CRT OPERATOR answers.

                          CRT OPERATOR
           Thank you for calling Crestin,
           Roland and Thomas. How may I
           direct your call?

                          PAUL
           Somebody, I need to talk to someone
           right away. It's an emergency.

                          CRT OPERATOR
           Who is this, please?

                          PAUL
           Paul Conroy. I'm a driver for you
           guys. I'm calling from Iraq. My
           convoy was attacked.

                          CRT OPERATOR
           Sir, if this is a crisis situation
           you need to contact the Safety
           Number your were provided.

           15.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           I know, I know, but I don't have
           it. They took it.

                          CRT OPERATOR
           Who took it, sir?

                          PAUL
           The Iraqis, I think. I don't
           remember, I blacked out.

                          CRT OPERATOR
           I'm going to put you through to
           Alan Davenport.

                          PAUL
           Davenport? Who's that?

                         

                          CRT OPERATOR
           Director of Personnel. Please
           hold.

                          PAUL
           Personnel? No, I need to talk --
          Paul is placed on hold. Synthesized soft rock plays in the
          background of the phone, maddening Paul further. Over the
          music, a CRT SPOKESMAN is heard, speaking a recorded
          testimonial during the on-hold message.

                          CRT SPOKESMAN
           At CRT, we work with our clients to
           provide effective and sustainable
           solutions to the challenges they
           face in our fast-growing, global
           economy. As the premiere...

                         
          The message is interrupted by ALAN DAVENPORT's outgoing voice
          message.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           You've reached Alan Davenport,
           personnel director at Crestin,
           Roland and Thomas. Please leave
           your name and number at the tone
           and I will return your call as soon
           as possible.
          The BEEP sounds. Paul is confused as to why he was patched
          through to someone in human resources, but leaves a message
          nevertheless.

           16.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           This is Paul Conroy, I'm from
           Hastings, Michigan. I'm a driver
           for CRT, and my convoy was
           ambushed...by insurgents or
           terrorists. I don't know. I don't
           know who it was. I'm stuck in the
           ground, buried in a coffin and I
           need help. Please send help. I'm
           begging you. I think I'm in
           Baqubah in the Diyala Provence.
           Please send help right away. I
           can't breathe in here. I
           can't...please. I'm begging you.
           I don't know who else to call.

           I...

                         
          Paul notices that his phone has again lost signal.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)

                          (EXASPERATED)
           ...fuck.
          Paul drops the phone to his side, the screen still emitting
          its glow.
          He explodes with a mixture of rage and fear. He screams and
          flails his feet and hands wildly, banging them against the
          walls of the coffin. His animalistic outburst causes the
          phone to close.
          The coffin returns to pitch black.
          After a long beat, Paul lights the Zippo, which remains
          wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole in the
          wall of the coffin.

                         
          Paul takes a few moments to catch his breath. He looks again
          at the cell phone. Remembers receiving a Text Message.
          The icon on the phone's display indicates that he does, in
          fact, have an unread Text Message waiting for him.
          Paul quickly scrolls through the phone's menu, which is all
          written in Arabic, until he reaches what appears to be the
          Text Message option. Opening it, he sees a series of ten
          numbers.
          Using his click-up pencil, he scribbles the numbers onto the
          top of the coffin. Next to the number, he writes the word
          "HELP?" Noticing that his phone has again picked-up a
          signal, he dials the number.

           17.

                         

                         
          It rings once, but then the reception begins to falter.
          After only two rings, the call is ended. Paul's frustration
          mounts. He is barely able to fight off another fit of
          hysterics. He dials the number again.
          It rings once. A second ring. In the middle of the third
          ring, someone answers -- but they do not say anything.

                          PAUL
           Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?
           Hello?
          After a beat, Paul hears breathing on the other end of the
          phone. He also hears a discordance of background sound; the
          din of a room filled with Arabic-speaking men.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Hello? Who are you? Please, you
           have to help me.
          Still, Paul's words are only met with slow, measured breaths.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Who is this? Hello?
          The person on the other end eventually speaks. An Iraqi man,
          JABIR, talks forcefully and aggressively in broken English.

                          JABIR
           Breathe no breathe, American? Ah?
           Breathe no breathe?

                          PAUL
           What? I don't know what you're
           saying. Who is this?

                         

                          JABIR
           American can breathe no breathe?

                          PAUL
           No, I can't breathe. Please get me
           out of here.

                          JABIR
           Get out?

                          PAUL
           Yes, please get me out. Help me.

                          JABIR
           Soldier.

           18.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           No, no I'm not a soldier. I'm a
           truck driver. That's it. I'm not
           a soldier. I'm a contractor.

                          JABIR
           Contractor?

                          PAUL
           Yes, that's right. A contractor.
           Not a soldier.

                          JABIR
           Blackwater.

                          PAUL
           No, not for Blackwater. I'm not a
           security contractor. Truck driver,
           I'm a truck driver. That's all.

                          JABIR
           You are American.

                          PAUL
           Yes.

                          JABIR
           Then you are soldier.
          Despair falls upon Paul. It becomes clear that Jabir is
          responsible for all of this. As such, Paul crosses out the
          word "HELP?" Closes the lid of the Zippo, leaving only the
          cell phone display screen to illuminate his face.

                          PAUL
           No, I'm not. I'm here unarmed.
           But, you still shot at us.

                          JABIR
           In head and in throat, so you tell
           no more lies.

                          PAUL
           I'm not lying! We were all
           drivers.

                          JABIR
           Drive what?

                          PAUL
           Trucks. The big trucks you see
           driving around with the supplies?
           That's us. That's me. We're not
           soldiers.

           19.

                         

                         

                          JABIR
           Five million money.

                          PAUL
           What?

                          JABIR
           Five million money tonight by nine
           PM or you stay. Buried like dog.

                          PAUL
           Five million dollars? From who?

                          JABIR
           Your family.

                          PAUL
           My family doesn't have five million
           dollars. If they did, I wouldn't
           be here.

                          JABIR
           From Embassy.

                          PAUL
           I don't know, yes, the Embassy will
           pay you. If you let me go, they'll
           pay you the money.
          Silence on the other end of the phone.

                          JABIR
           (after a long beat)
           Nine PM, five million money.
          Jabir hangs up the phone, forcing Paul to instantly come to
          grips with the fact that he is being held hostage.
          He lays back in the coffin, shell-shocked. Physically spent,
          the cell phone falls from his hands and onto the floor. The
          display screen casts a dim light throughout the coffin.

                          FADE TO:

          INT. COFFIN - MOMENTS LATER

          The Zippo lights. Paul holds it in his hand, using it to
          illuminate the inside of the coffin. He attempts to push it
          into its now customary resting place, but the sand has
          loosened, making it difficult for the Zippo to stay in place.
          It almost falls to the floor.

           20.

                         

                         
          Looking around, Paul sees there is a crack between two
          planks, located on the opposite wall of the coffin. He
          wedges the lit Zippo into the crack.
          With his hands now free, Paul haphazardly positions himself
          so that his back is facing the top of the coffin.
          His every move is arduous; the claustrophobic nature of the
          coffin bearing down on him.
          Paul positions his bent knees underneath his chest, with his
          shins and feet pressed against the bottom of the coffin.
          Using the strength of his legs, he attempts to lift the top
          off the coffin with his back.
          Trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin,
          sprinkling against the wooden base.

                         
          He fails, only to immediately try again. And again. And
          again. Exhaustion sets in.
          Staring ahead, the phone sits in front of him. He notices
          that the battery life bars are still at one solid and one
          blinking.
          He grabs the cell phone, staring at it, trying to think of
          someone else to call.
          The battery life is limited. Every call has to count.
          He tries to remember some phone numbers, but has trouble
          recalling the information.

                          PAUL

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Come on, what's her number?

                         
          He cannot remember the number he's thinking of. He notices
          that the flame of the Zippo flickers, indicating its use of
          his much-needed oxygen. Paul closes the lid, extinguishing
          the flame.
          A second later, we see him, lit by the cell phone display
          screen. He dials the international code for the United
          States, followed by 411 information.
          A MALE 411 OPERATOR answers.

                          MALE 411 OPERATOR
           What city and listing, please?

                          PAUL
           Hastings, Michigan. I'm looking
           for Donna Mitchell.

           21.

                         

                         

                          MALE 411 OPERATOR
           I have two Donna Mitchells, sir.
           One on Federal Road and one on
           Ardmore Avenue.

                          PAUL
           Ardmore Avenue...I think. Yeah.
           Shit, I don't know. Just give me
           that one.

                          MALE 411 OPERATOR
           Ardmore Avenue?

                          PAUL
           Yes, Ardmore Avenue.

                          MALE 411 OPERATOR
           Please hold for your number.
          Paul is switched to an AUTOMATED MESSAGE.

                          AUTOMATED MESSAGE
           The number you requested, 269-948-
           1998 can automatically be dialed
           for a charge of twenty-five cents
           by pressing the number one.
          Paul writes Donna's number and name on the top of the coffin
          and then presses the number one. He is connected.
          Her phone rings and rings. Paul's frustration is evident.

                          PAUL
           Come on! Where the hell is
           everyone?

                         
          The phone rings some more. Paul checks the battery life --
          still at one and a half bars.
          DONNA eventually answers.

                          DONNA
           Hello?
          Hearing her voice, Paul hurriedly places the phone to his
          ear.

                          PAUL
           Donna, it's Paul.

                          DONNA
           Hey, how's it going?

           22.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Where's Linda? She's not answering
           her phone. I need to talk to her,
           I've been taken hostage by...
          Donna interrupts. We realize, as does Paul, that her voice
          was actually coming from her answering machine.

                          DONNA

                          (OVERLAPPING)
           Fooled you. I'm not really home.
           But if you leave a message, I'll
           get back to you as soon as I get
           in. Bye-bye.
          His hand falls to his forehead, defeated.

                         

                          PAUL
           Donna, I need to talk to Linda.
           It's an absolute emergency. Have
           her call me. Use star sixty-nine
           and find out the number I'm calling
           from and have her call me...
          Donna picks up the phone.

                          DONNA
           Paul?

                          PAUL
           Donna.

                          DONNA
           What do you want?

                          PAUL
           I need to talk to Linda. Where is
           she?

                          DONNA
           I don't know. I haven't talked to
           her all day. Call her cell phone.

                          PAUL
           Are you near a computer or
           something?

                          DONNA
           Uh...yeah. Why?

                          PAUL
           Turn it on.

           23.

                         

                         

                          DONNA
           It is on.

                          PAUL
           Look up the number for the State
           Department for me.

                          DONNA
           I was just heading out to the
           supermarket. I really don't have

                          TIME --

                          PAUL
           Donna, please, please, please --
           just get me the number.

                          DONNA
           Is everything alright?

                          PAUL
           No! Everything is not alright!
           So, please, just look up the
           number.

                          DONNA
           Don't fucking yell at me, Paul.

                          PAUL
           I'm not yelling!

                          DONNA
           Yes you are. Just like you did
           last year at the cookout. I'm not
           going to tolerate --

                          PAUL

                          (EXPLODING)
           Just get me the fucking number!!
           Get me the number, get me the
           number!!
          Donna hangs up on him. Realizing this, Paul bangs his fists
          and claws at the top of the coffin, bloodying some of his
          fingers and knuckles in the process.
          He violently tosses and turns and screams at the top of his
          lungs, like an animal trapped in a cage. Tears spray from
          his eyes as spit shakes free from his mouth by the force of
          his shudder.
          He eventually calms quite a bit. Sniffing away tears and
          taking notice of the damage he's done to his hands, Paul
          slows his breathing as best he can.

           24.

                         

                         
          He lies there, motionless.
          The silence is almost comforting. Paul closes his eyes,
          regretfully accepting what appears will be his inescapable
          fate.
          After a beat, he calls Donna back. Knowing it is Paul
          calling, she answers right away, attitude at the ready.

                          DONNA
           What?
          It takes every ounce of Paul's being to keep himself from
          going off the deep end. He takes a beat to compose himself
          and then finally offers a very delicate and deliberate
          response.

                         

                          PAUL
           Donna, I'm very sorry I yelled.
           But, I'm only going to ask you once
           more to get me this number. If you
           don't get me this number, I'm going
           to die.

                          DONNA
           What?

                          PAUL
           I don't have time to explain.
           Please...the number.

                          DONNA

                          (BEAT)
           Hold on.
          We hear Donna put down the phone. In the b.g., we hear the
          sound of keys being pressed on a computer keyboard.
          After a beat, she picks the phone back up.

                          DONNA (CONT'D)
           Okay...State Department. It's 202-

           134-4750.

                          PAUL

           202-134-4750?

                          DONNA
           Yeah.
          Paul writes the number on the top of the coffin, beneath the
          man others. He writes the initials "S.D." next to it.

           25.

                         

                         

                          DONNA
           What the hell's going --
          Paul hangs up on Donna mid-sentence. He dials the number the
          State Department right away.
          A STATE DEPARTMENT REP answers after a few rings.

           STATE DEPARTMENT REP
           United States Department of State.

                          PAUL
           I'm an American citizen, working in
           Iraq. I've been taken hostage. I
           need to speak to someone right
           away.

                         

           STATE DEPARTMENT REP
           Where are you calling from, sir?

                          PAUL
           From Iraq. I'm a truck driver for
           CRT -- Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
           We were attacked and now I'm being
           held for ransom.

           STATE DEPARTMENT REP
           Are the kidnappers with you?

                          PAUL
           No. I'm buried somewhere.

           STATE DEPARTMENT REP
           You're buried?

                          PAUL
           Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box.
           It's an old coffin, I think.

           STATE DEPARTMENT REP
           Did you try contacting the military
           out there?

                          PAUL
           I don't have the number.

           STATE DEPARTMENT REP
           What number?

                          PAUL
           I was given a number to call, a
           safety number. But the people took
           it.

           26.

                         

                         

           STATE DEPARTMENT REP
           The people holding you hostage?

                          PAUL
           Yes.

           STATE DEPARTMENT REP

                          (DISCONCERTED)
           I don't know...hold on. Let me
           connect you...hold on.

                          PAUL
           No. Wait...
          Paul is placed on hold. As he waits, his eyes wander around
          the coffin. He looks at the numbers he has written.

                         
          After a moment, REBECCA BROWNING, a State Department
          official, picks up the phone.

                          REBECCA
           Rebecca Browning.

                          PAUL
           Hello?

                          REBECCA
           Yes, hello. I was just informed of
           your situation.

                          PAUL
           Yeah, my situation. I'm running
           out of time and you people keep
           putting me on hold. What the hell
           is wrong with you?

                         

                          REBECCA
           I'm sorry.

                          PAUL
           Don't be sorry. Just help me.

                          REBECCA
           I just have a few questions for
           you, Mister Conroy.

                          PAUL
           You've got to be kidding me.

                          REBECCA
           It's important that I get this
           information. It will make a rescue

                          ATTEMPT --

           27.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Wait, wait, wait...how did you know
           my name?

                          REBECCA
           I'm sorry?

                          PAUL
           I never gave you my name. I don't
           think I gave it to the other guy,
           either.
          Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What the hell is going on right
           now?

                         

                          REBECCA
           (after a beat)
           We received a call from a
           representative at CRT. You left
           him a message?

                          PAUL
           Yeah...?

                          REBECCA
           He contacted us right away.

                          PAUL
           Well, since you know what the hell
           is going on, what have you done to
           get me out of here?

                          REBECCA
           There's little we can do from
           Washington.

                          PAUL
           So, that's it? I'm just supposed
           to rot in here because there's
           little you can do?

                          REBECCA
           No.

                          PAUL
           Then what?

                          REBECCA
           I need to know where you were when
           your convoy was ambushed.

           28.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           In the Diyala Provence. In
           Baqubah.

                          REBECCA
           Okay. And has contact been made
           with the kidnappers?

                          PAUL
           Yes. The guy told me that he wants
           five million dollars by nine
           o'clock tonight.

                          REBECCA
           Or else...?

                          PAUL
           Or else he'll bring me to Sea
           World. What do you think, lady?
          Even faced with Paul's sarcasm, Rebecca remains stolid.
          Professional.

                          REBECCA
           We'll do everything we can.

                          PAUL
           So you'll pay them?

                          REBECCA

                          (BEAT)
           No. That we can't do.

                          PAUL
           Wait...what?

                         

                          REBECCA
           It's the policy of the United
           States government to not negotiate
           with terrorists.

                          PAUL
           To hell with that! It's easy for
           you to worry about policy, you're
           sitting in an air conditioned
           office somewhere, probably
           finishing up your sandwich from
           lunch. You're not the one stuck in
           a coffin, buried in the God damn
           desert!

                          REBECCA
           I understand your frustration --

           29.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Frustration? Lady, I'm going to
           fucking die in here. Understand
           that!
          Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone. Paul
          wonders if she is still there. The idea of being alone again
          scares him terribly.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Hello?
          Worried, Paul lights the Zippo. The reflection of the flame
          dances on his frightened eyes.

                          REBECCA
           I'm here.

                         
          Momentary relief. After a beat:

                          PAUL
           Well, then say something. Tell me
           how you're going to get me out of
           here.

                          REBECCA
           What's the number on the phone
           you're calling from?

                          PAUL
           I don't know. Did it come up on
           your end?

                          REBECCA
           No. It's listed as unavailable.
           Do this -- take down this number.

                         
          Paul takes out his pen.

                          PAUL
           Go ahead.

                          REBECCA

           410-195-5453.
          Paul writes the number onto the top of the coffin.

                          PAUL
           Who's that?

                          REBECCA
           Dan Brenner. He's the commander of
           the Hostage Working Group over in
           Iraq.

           30.

                         

                         
          Paul writes "D. BRENNER" next to Dan's phone number.

                          PAUL
           Hostage Working Group?

                          REBECCA
           We formed it in 2004 to deal with
           situations such as yours.
          Paul shakes his head in disgust.

                          PAUL
           Situations. I love how you keep
           calling it that.

                          REBECCA
           Did you write down the number?

                         

                          PAUL
           Yeah.

                          REBECCA
           Good. Hold on, I'll connect you
           with him now. He should be
           expecting you.

                          PAUL
           What about the news? I'm going to
           call them.

                          REBECCA
           No. Do not, I repeat, do not
           contact the news.

                          PAUL
           Why?

                         

                          REBECCA
           It will only complicate things
           further and threaten your chances
           of rescue.
          Paul doesn't buy it.

                          PAUL
           That's bullshit. You're just
           covering your ass.

                          REBECCA
           No, I'm covering yours. Everyone
           who needs to know about this does.

           31.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           You don't go looking for something
           if you don't know it's missing.

                          REBECCA
           That's why you need to contact Dan
           Brenner right away.
          Paul still contemplates contacting the news, but soon
          acquiesces to Rebecca's pleas for him not to.

                          PAUL
           Fine.

                          REBECCA
           I'm transferring you now.

                         
          Rebecca's gone. Paul waits. Several beeps sound as he's
          being transferred.
          Paul hears a faint sound coming from behind him, outside the
          coffin. While the beeps continue to sound, he lights the
          Zippo, circumspectly looking behind him. He doesn't see
          anything.
          With the Zippo still lit, Paul takes a deep, centering
          breath, followed by another.
          A few more long beeps pass before a ring is heard. After two
          rings, DAN BRENNER answers.

                          DAN
           Brenner.

                          PAUL
           Dan Brenner?

                         
          Dan is quick to figure out who it is that must be calling
          him.

                          DAN
           Is this Paul Conroy?

                          PAUL

                          (EXCITED)
           Yes, yes it's me. It's Paul.

                          DAN
           Paul, I was informed of what's
           going on. I want you to know that
           we're already working on trying to
           get you out of there.

           32.

                         

                         
          Paul is relieved. His first glint of hope has appeared.
          Tears of joy instantly escape his eyes.

                          PAUL
           Oh, thank you, God.

                          DAN
           I was told that we have until 9pm.
           Is that right?

                          PAUL
           That's what he said.

                          DAN
           Alright. That doesn't give us a
           whole lot of time. And just so I
           have this right, the kidnappers
           buried you in the ground?

                          PAUL
           Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin.

                          DAN
           Okay. My guess is that since
           you're able to get a cell signal,
           you're no more than a few feet
           underground.

                          PAUL
           I don't know. Maybe.

                          DAN
           What about battery life? How much
           does the phone have left?
          Paul looks at the display to find out.

                         

                          PAUL
           Less than half.

                          DAN
           Okay. You have to conserve that
           battery. Our best bet of finding
           you is by tracking your cell
           signal. Is the ringer set on a
           sound or vibrate?

                          PAUL
           Vibrate.

                          DAN
           Press and hold down the asterisk
           key to change it to a ring tone.
           It will use less power.

           33.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
          What about my Zippo?

                          DAN
          You have a lighter?

                          PAUL
          Yeah.

                          DAN
          Use it to look around for markings,
          a logo -- whatever you can find.

                          PAUL
          Won't it use up oxygen?

                          DAN
          Not much. Don't worry about that
          now. Try to find --

                          PAUL
          It's really dark in here without
          it.

                          DAN
          I understand, Paul. Try to find
          anything in there that might
          indicate where that coffin was
          made.

                          PAUL
          You guys have to hurry.

                          DAN
          We're working as fast as we can,
          Paul.

                         

                          PAUL
          Do you know if there were any other
          survivors?

                          DAN
          From your convoy?

                          PAUL
          Yeah.

                          DAN
          That's still unclear at this point.

                          PAUL
          I just wanted to do right by my
          family. That's all.

                          (MORE)

           34.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I didn't know it was going to be
           like this over here.

                          DAN
           I don't think any of us did.
          While on the phone with Brenner, Paul gets another call
          coming in. He checks the display and reads the number.
          Matching it against a number he wrote on the top of the
          coffin, he sees that is Jabir calling.

                          PAUL
           It's him. He's calling.

                          DAN
           The kidnapper?

                         

                          PAUL
           Yeah. What do I do?

                          DAN
           You know his number?

                          PAUL
           Yeah.

                          DAN
           Give it to me.

                          PAUL
           What about the call?

                          DAN
           Give me the number first.
          The phone has rung several times. Paul fears that Jabir may
          hang up.

                          PAUL
           He's going to hang up.

                          DAN
           Take the call.

                          PAUL

                          BUT --

                          DAN
           Take the call. Now.
          Paul complies with Dan's demand and switches to the other
          line.

           35.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Hello.

                          JABIR
           Two hour, six minute.
          Paul looks at his watch. Indeed, he has but two hours and
          six minutes until the time reaches 9pm.

                          PAUL
           You have to give me more time.

                          JABIR
           You talk to embassy? They give
           money?

                          PAUL
           Yes. No. I talked to...someone.
           Government. They said that they
           won't pay the money.

                          JABIR
           No pay?

                          PAUL
           No. They said that they don't
           negotiate with terrorists.

                          JABIR
           Terrorists? I am terrorist?

                          PAUL
           Yes. You are terrorist, you son of
           a bitch.

                          JABIR
           You are terrified, so I am
           terrorist?

                          PAUL
           What did I ever do to you?

                          JABIR
           Ever do?

                          PAUL
           Yeah. I'm here because it's a job,
           to make money. That's it.

                          JABIR
           I have job until you come. Now, my
           family have nothing.

           36.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           That's not my fault!
          Jabir retorts with a spirited conviction similar to Paul's.

                          JABIR
           Nine, one, one was not my fault,
           but still you are here! Saddam was
           not my fault, but still you are
           here!

                          PAUL
           I told you, I'm only here to work.
           To help rebuild.

                          JABIR
           Rebuild what you destroyed.

                         
          Paul cannot handle his stress any longer. He begins to
          crumble under the pressure.

                          PAUL
           Stop! Just please, stop! I'm just
           a guy. I'm just a truck driver.
           Okay? I'm nobody that makes
           decisions about anything. I just
           want to go home.
          Silence from the other end of the phone for an extended
          period of time.

                          JABIR
           You make video, ransom video.
          This surprisingly comes as good news to Paul.

                         

                          PAUL
           Yes. Please. Get me out of here
           and I'll make the video.

                          JABIR
           No. You make video now.

                          PAUL
           What...? How?

                          JABIR
           You use video on phone.
          Paul's hopes are dashed. His sanguine head falls back onto
          the coffin floor.

           37.

                         

                         

                          JABIR (CONT'D)
           Near foot. You read note near foot
           in box.
          Paul shines the flame of his Zippo lighter toward his feet.
          He doesn't see anything.

                          PAUL
           Where? I don't see --

                          JABIR
           Near foot. Read note inside box.
          Paul repositions his legs as best he can. He can vaguely see
          the corner of a small metal box, partially sticking out of a
          broken plank on the bottom of the coffin.

                         

                          PAUL
           The video...if I make it, will you
           let me go?

                          JABIR
           Only if we get money.

                          PAUL
           Nobody's going to pay five million
           dollars for me.

                          JABIR
           We take less. One million money.

                          PAUL
           If they pay it, will you let me go?

                          JABIR
           (after a beat)
           One million money.
          Jabir hangs up, ending the call.
          Paul sits motionless for a moment, soaking in all that Jabir
          has just told him.
          He again looks down toward his feet. He can see the
          protruding corner of the metal box, but it's positioned in
          such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach
          it.
          Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after
          several unsuccessful attempts, he realizes that a new
          strategy is necessary.

           38.

                         

                         
          He makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so that
          his head and feet will ultimately switch places. He
          struggles, inch by troubled inch, to make this maneuver.
          Sweat pours down the side of his face. The extremely tight
          quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly
          impossible.
          After expending a great deal of energy doing so, Paul
          eventually completes the turn of his body. He examines the
          small, rusted metal box. On it is a cartoon picture of a
          small Arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball.
          Skeptical at first, Paul carefully examines the box and
          shakes it gently. Items are heard rummaging inside.
          He carefully opens it. A fluorescent green light shines from
          inside.
          Paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick,
          fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the coffin.
          He closes the lid of the Zippo. Removes the stick.
          Looking into the small box again, he finds several other
          items: a small, disused flashlight; a second, unlit glow
          stick; a jackknife; and lastly, a folded piece of paper.
          He slowly unfolds the piece of paper. We see that his ransom
          message is written in an unintelligible mix of English and
          Arabic.
          Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust. He
          crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to
          his side. He covers his face with his hands, his labored
          breaths echoing in his palms.

                         
          Under the low-light of the green glow stick, Paul picks up
          the phone and dials his home.
          Per usual, he gets the answering machine. His son, Shane, is
          heard on outgoing message.

                          SHANE
           Thanks for calling the Conroy's.
           We're not home right now. Please
           leave a message at the beep.
           Thanks.
          Paul's eyes well up with tears. He smiles at the sound of
          his son's voice. The Beep is heard. Paul hangs up without
          leaving a message.
          He looks at the time. It's 7:02pm. Battery life is holding
          steady at one and a half bars. He remembers something.

           39.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Shit.
          Paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone
          that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone.
          The glow stick begins to slowly fade.
          Paul dials Dan Brenner.
          After a few rings, Dan answers.

                          DAN
           Paul?

                          PAUL
           Here's his number...

                         
          Paul presses the green key, bringing up the last numbers
          dialed and received.

                          DAN
           Hold on. Alright, go ahead.

                          PAUL
           It's 07902-24-921.
          Dan says something to someone who is in the room with him,
          and then returns his attention to Paul.

                          DAN
           This is huge. Unless they're using
           a cloned line, we should be able to
           find where this is coming from in
           minutes.

                         

                          PAUL
           What about me? Can you track my
           cell signal?

                          DAN
           We're having a lot of trouble with
           yours. Seems to be an EDS line,
           probably through one of the
           Egyptian carriers.

                          PAUL
           What does that mean?

                          DAN
           That...it's not going to be easy.

                          PAUL
           He wants me to make a ransom video.

           40.

                         

                         

                          DAN
           No. Hold off for as long as you
           can.

                          PAUL
           If it's going to get me out of
           here, I'm making it.

                          DAN
           The last thing we want is for this
           to end up all over Al Jazeera.

                          PAUL
           We?
          Paul becomes angry, again sensing that more emphasis is being
          placed on containing the situation than rescuing him.

                         

                          DAN
           This can't turn into an
           international incident.

                          PAUL
           That's all you people care about!
           But what about me? Don't you care
           about me?

                          DAN
           We do. That's why we're --

                          PAUL
           No you don't! You people don't
           care about any of us. I've had
           eight friends killed out here, six
           of them today. We don't have any
           guns, any armor. Nothing.

                         

                          DAN
           You're not soldiers.

                          PAUL
           Tell that to the people who put me
           in this box! Tell that to the
           people who shot my friends!

                          DAN
           We're doing the best we can.

                          PAUL
           No, you're not. All you people
           understand are your secret plans
           and your back room politics.

                          (MORE)

           41.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           If I were some diplomat or
           something, maybe even a hostage
           working group leader -- or whatever
           your fancy title is, I'd be out of
           here by now. Wouldn't I? But I'm
           not, so I'm just supposed to keep
           my mouth shut and die.

                          DAN
           I need you to stay focused, Paul.

                          PAUL
           Fuck you.
          Dan's heard enough.

                          DAN
           Paul, listen to me: finding you is
           our primary concern. Bottom line.
           And we're searching just as hard as
           we would be for a four-star
           general, so don't literally waste
           your breath suggesting otherwise.
          Paul does not respond at first. Dan's retort clearly has an
          effect on him.

                          PAUL
           Who are they? The people who put
           me here?

                          DAN
           They're just that -- people. No
           different from you and me.

                          PAUL
           I'm no terrorist.

                          DAN
           Neither are they.

                          PAUL
           How do you know that?

                          DAN
           If you were homeless,
           starving...actually, I take that
           back. If your family was homeless
           and starving, what would you do for
           them?

                          PAUL
           I wouldn't kill someone.

           42.

                         

                         

                          DAN
           How can you be sure?

                          PAUL

                          (GETTING FRUSTRATED)
           What difference does it make?

                          DAN
           They're criminals, desperate ones
           at that. They don't care about
           anything other than getting the
           money.

                          PAUL
           So pay them, then.

                          DAN
           Trust me, if it was an option, I
           would do that in a heartbeat.

                          PAUL
           How many others have there been?

                          DAN
           Since I got here? Hundreds.
           Journalists, contractors,
           soldiers...hundreds have been
           taken. It's one of the only
           functioning businesses out here.

                          PAUL
           How many have you rescued?
          Dan is reluctant to answer the question.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           How many?

                          DAN

                          (BEAT)
           Not many.

                          PAUL
           Tell me their names.

                          DAN
           Who?

                          PAUL
           Any of them. Make me know they
           really do matter to you.

                          DAN
           Mark White.

           43.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Who was Mark White?

                          DAN
           A kid from New Hampshire. Twenty-
           six years old. Med student. Came
           over here to help out local
           doctors.

                          PAUL
           What happened to him?

                          DAN
           Insurgents grabbed him.

                          PAUL
           When?

                         

                          DAN
           About three weeks ago.
          Paul writes "MARK WHITE" on the top of the coffin, below the
          list of phone numbers. He circles the name.

                          PAUL
           You remember his name.

                          DAN
           I remember all their names.

                          PAUL
           (afraid to ask)
           Did he...? Is he...?
          The glow stick begins to fade.

                         

                          DAN
           Yeah. Yeah, Paul, he's alive.
          Hearing this affords Paul some semblance of relief.
          Paul shakes the glow stick, returning it to its full
          strength.

                          PAUL
           Where is he?

                          DAN
           Home. Probably happy to be back at
           school.

                          PAUL
           I want to get out of here.

           44.

                         

                         

                          DAN
           We found him; we'll find you, too.

                          PAUL
           How?

                          DAN
           We already have a solid lead on the
           number you gave us.

                          PAUL
           You do?

                          DAN
           A unit's on it's way over there
           now.

                         
          This news calms Paul's nerves.

                          PAUL
           That's...that's good.

                          DAN
           Yeah.

                          PAUL
           What should I do in the meantime?

                          DAN
           I know it's hard, but try to relax.
           The more worked up you are, the
           more air you're going to use.

                          PAUL
           I can't help it. I'm always
           anxious. I take pills for it.

                         

                          DAN
           Do you have them with you?
          Paul checks his pants pockets. He removes a small, orange
          pill bottle.

                          PAUL
           Yeah.

                          DAN
           Take them. You need to preserve
           your oxygen level any way you can.

                          PAUL
           Okay.

           45.

                         

                         

                          DAN
           Is your Zippo still lit.

                          PAUL
           Not now.

                          DAN
           Good.

                          PAUL
           I feel nauseous.

                          DAN
           You have to calm down.

                          PAUL
           I'm trying.

                         

                          DAN
           And you need to save that battery.
           We're expecting some intel in about
           ten minutes. Call me back then.

                          PAUL
           Okay.

                          DAN
           Just hang in there, Paul.
          The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul shakes it,
          causing it to brighten only momentarily before dimming again.

                          PAUL
           Yeah. I'm trying.
          Dan ends the call. Paul lets out a deep breath, finding it
          difficult to lay claim to its replacement.
          He looks at his watch. It's now 7:18pm. The ticking sound
          of the second hand turning is inordinately loud, due to the
          extreme silence of the coffin.
          Just then, the cell phone rings. Checking the number on the
          display, Paul sees that it is Jabir.
          Paul answers.

                          PAUL
           What?

                          JABIR
           Did you make video?

           46.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           No.
          Jabir yells something in Arabic to the other Iraqi men we
          hear in the background.
          Collectively, they do not sound pleased. Slightly panicked,
          in fact, though it is difficult to tell for sure.

                          JABIR

                          (TO PAUL)
           You make video!

                          PAUL
           Let me out and I'll make it.

                          JABIR
           No! You make video now. In box.

                          PAUL
           I can't. I can't read the paper.

                          JABIR
           Make video now!

                          PAUL
           I can't. I don't know what you
           want me to say. I can't read the
           paper.
          Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the
          background. Although they speak in Arabic, it is clear from
          their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly
          hostile.
          Jabir returns his attention back to Paul.

                         

                          JABIR
           You make video now.
          Jabir ends the call. Paul closes the phone to help conserve
          battery life.
          He then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu
          options. Everything is written in Arabic. He eventually
          comes across an icon with a movie camera -- the video
          function. He turns it on. Looks at himself though the
          viewfinder.
          After a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and
          growing more panicked. His breaths grow heavy and rapid,
          utilizing a great deal of oxygen.

           47.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           I'm never getting out of here.
          Paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the
          coffin and pressing against the sides and top.
          The glow stick fades out almost completely, offering very
          little light. Paul shakes it, but with no change to its
          brightness. Moments later, it dies. Paul tries the
          flashlight. Click-click. Click-click. Nothing.
          He bangs it a few times with his hand. The white light turns
          on, but quickly turns back off. He twists the top, which
          causes the flashlight to switch bulbs. A red beam emits
          momentarily. Paul twists the top again and gives the
          flashlight a few good whacks.

                         
          It turns on. White light shines dimly on his face.
          He takes a breath.
          In efforts to calm himself, he once again removes the orange
          pill bottle from his pocket. He pours two into his hand. He
          then removes his small, metal alcohol flask from his back
          pocket and takes a large swig, swallowing the two pills in
          the process.
          Still, Paul's heavy, labored breathing continues. He drops
          four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet
          another generous pull from the flask.
          He sits and waits. Nothing is happening, except that his
          extremely limited time keeps passing.
          After a moment, Paul picks up the cell phone. He holds it in
          front of him, hesitant to make a call. After some
          consideration, he dials.
          After a few rings, a NURSING HOME NURSE answers.

           NURSING HOME NURSE
           Mountain View Nursing Home.

                          PAUL
           I was hoping I could speak with
           Maryanne Conroy, please.

           NURSING HOME NURSE
           Um...okay. Ah...let me bring the
           cordless phone to her room. Hold
           on a moment, please.
          We hear the Nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor. She
          soon reaches Paul's mother's room.

           48.

                         

                         

           NURSING HOME NURSE (CONT'D)
           Misses Conroy, you have a telephone
           call, dear. Here, you can use this
           phone.
          Paul's mother, MARYANNE, answers. Her voice is pleasant but
          confused. It's clear that she suffers from advanced stages
          of Alzheimer's Disease.

                          MARYANNE
           Hello?

                          PAUL
           Mom...it's Paul.

                          MARYANNE
           Who?

                         

                          PAUL
           It's Paul, Mom. Your son.

                          MARYANNE
           My son?

                          PAUL
           It's okay, Mom. How are you?

                          MARYANNE
           I'm fine.

                          PAUL
           That's good.

                          MARYANNE
           Who are you?

                         

                          PAUL
           It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie.

                          MARYANNE
           Paulie?

                          PAUL
           Yeah. Remember? We lived over on
           Colfax Street, in the duplex.
           Remember?

                          MARYANNE

                          (REMEMBERING SLIGHTLY)
           Paulie?

                          PAUL
           That's right, Mom.

           49.

                         

                         

                          MARYANNE
           Is this Paulie?

                          PAUL
           It is, Mom. It's Paulie. How's
           everything at the home?

                          MARYANNE
           Very nice. Your father and I have
           been playing gin rummy every night.
          It's almost too much for Paul to take. He cries silent tears
          over a heartbroken smile.

                          PAUL
           Yeah...I don't think Pop's there
           with you, Mom.

                         

                          MARYANNE
           How are you doing, sweetie?

                          PAUL
           Not very good. This...uh, this may
           be the last time I talk to you.

                          MARYANNE
           That's nice, honey.

                          PAUL
           Did you get the flowers I sent a
           few months ago?

                          MARYANNE
           Flowers?

                          PAUL
           Yeah, I sent...never mind. Listen,
           I...I'm going to go now. I just
           wanted to talk to you, you know,
           just to say bye. I love you, Mom.
          Maryanne doesn't respond.

                          PAUL(CONT'D)
           Did you hear me? Mom? I told
           you...do you want to tell me you

                          LOVE --

                          MARYANNE
           Yes, dear. Your father and I have
           been playing gin rummy every night.

           50.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           (after a beat)
           Okay, Mom. Tell Pop I said hi.
          Paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart out.
          He lays there, sobbing relentlessly.
          After a long beat, the cell phone rings. Decidedly different
          than his past reactions to an incoming call, Paul seems
          hopelessly disinterested. The ring is maddening.
          He mindlessly presses the shortcut button, resetting the ring
          to vibrate mode.
          He eventually picks up the phone, but there is not anyone on
          the other end. It's then that he sees that it was not a call
          that came in, but instead was a picture message.
          Pressing what appears to be the Accept button, the incoming
          picture begins to download.
          Several seconds later, the picture downloads and an image
          appears on the display of Paul's cell phone. It's of a woman
          -- bound and gagged, a gun pressed against the side of her
          head.

                          PAUL
           Oh no. No, no, no!
          Paul frantically dials the number to reach Jabir. As soon as
          the phone connects, Paul begins his desperate plea.

                          JABIR
           Video make?

                         

                          PAUL
           Let her go. Please. Please don't
           hurt her.
          The Woman is heard in the background of Jabir's phone, crying
          muffled words through her muzzled mouth.

                          JABIR
           We shoot her if you no make video.

                          PAUL
           No! No, please no shoot. No shoot
           her.

                          JABIR
           You get money. American million.

           51.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           I will, I promise. Just don't
           shoot her. She's a mother, she's
           got two kids.

                          JABIR
           Two kids?

                          PAUL
           Yes. She has two kids.

                          JABIR
           I have five. Now only one. You
           make video. Now!!

                          PAUL
           Wait...

                         

                          JABIR
           No wait!! I give three seconds.

                          PAUL
           I can't read the paper.

                          JABIR
           Three...

                          PAUL
           No. Wait!

                          JABIR
           Two...

                          PAUL
           I don't know what you want me to
           say!

                         

                          JABIR
           One.

                          PAUL
           Okay! Okay, I'll make the video.
           Just, please, don't shoot.
          Jabir does not fire his gun. Paul attempts to catch his
          breath.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I need to hang up to make the
           video. Okay? Is that okay?

                          JABIR
           You have three minute to send
           video.

           52.

                         

                         
          Jabir hangs up, ending the call.
          Paul reaches for the balled-up piece of paper that has the
          ransom script written on it. It takes some trouble for him
          to grab it, but he is soon able to.
          Placing the flashlight next to the paper, Paul is again
          reminded of the incoherent nature of the script.

                          PAUL
           (re: the script)
           Fuck...
          He drops the paper to his side and opens the phone, setting
          it to the video record function. He places the flashlight
          close to his face so as to make his image more visible on the
          small, phone display screen.

                         
          He presses the record button.

                          PAUL
           (speaking at the phone)
           My name is Paul Conroy. I'm an
           American citizen from Hastings,
           Michigan. I'm a civilian truck
           driver for Crestin, Roland and
           Thomas. I've been taken hostage
           somewhere in Iraq...and I need one
           million dollars by nine o'clock
           tonight, Baghdad time, or else I'll
           be left to die in this coffin I'm
           buried in. I've been told that
           if...
          The flashlight goes out. Paul continues speaking in the
          darkness. After a few quick smacks, the flashlight turns
          back on.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           ...the money is paid, I will be let
           go. If it's not, I will die in
           here. These threats are real and
           will be followed through on.
          Trying to think of more to say, Paul soon opts for not saying
          anything further. He saves the message and then sends it to
          Jabir.
          We see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video
          has been sent.
          Paul places the phone on his chest. Still rubbing his
          temples, his eyes begin to flutter a bit. He tries to
          control his breathing and remain calm.

           53.

                         

                         
          He opens the phone and displays the photo of the Woman. He
          stares admiringly at her, hoping dearly that she will not be
          harmed.
          The effects of the anxiety pills finally taking effect, his
          eyes soon close and he drifts off to sleep.

                          FADE TO:

          INT. COFFIN - LATER

          Darkness once again. We hear the sound of Paul slowly
          awaking, followed the sight of Zippo sparks.
          It doesn't catch. The second glow stick is snapped,
          illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue.

                         
          Paul starts to move, but suddenly freezes. His eyes widen.
          His pupils dilate. Something is clearly very wrong, though
          we cannot see what.
          His eyes slowly shift downward, as if watching something move
          down his body. Beads of sweat form across his brow. His
          measured breaths are held for as long as they can be.
          Moving excruciatingly slow, Paul lowers the glow stick toward
          what he is looking at.
          A shape moves across his stomach, underneath his T-shirt.
          Paul's eyes are fixed on whatever it may be. He cautiously,
          slowly, moves the glow stick even closer.
          The shape disappears just as the light of the glow stick
          shines on whatever it may be. Still, Paul does not dare make
          any sudden move.

                         
          Paul's pant leg moves slightly, starting at the top, slowly
          undulating toward his cuff.
          Paul leans the glow stick in further. And further.
          Carefully. Moving a millimeter at a time. He shifts the
          position of his head slightly, charily, to see next to his
          feet.
          He leans in even closer with the glow stick. But then --
          -- his wary movement comes to immediate stop.
          It's a snake. A two-foot, saw-scaled viper. It has
          positioned itself in the corner of the coffin, inches from
          Paul's feet.

           54.

                         

                         
          His terror evident, Paul very slowly pulls his feet back
          toward his upper body, away from the snake. The confined
          space offers little room for safety.
          The snake turns its muscled neck to face Paul. Their eyes
          meet for the first time. The snake hisses, poised to strike
          at any moment. Paul raises his foot. Steels himself.
          Prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp.
          A more sensible plan soon prevails. After lowering his foot,
          Paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket. Slowly
          unscrews the top. Splashes a small amount of alcohol on the
          floor, close to the snake.
          The snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists itself
          into a new posture, ready to attack. Paul lowers the Zippo
          to the small puddle of alcohol. After a few sparks --

                         
          -- it lights. A flash-fire. The snake flails and hisses
          wildly at the other side of a small fire wall.
          The flame soon goes out. Paul moves fast. Throws more
          alcohol, this time some of it lands on the snake itself. He
          places the already lit Zippo against the puddle of alcohol
          near the snake.
          Another flash-fire, this time burning the snake. It hisses
          loudly. Threateningly. It swings back and forth,
          challenging the small wall of fire.
          The fire soon extinguishes. The snake burrows into the hole
          from where it likely entered the coffin, disappearing into it
          with haste.
          Paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button-down
          shirt. He then pours a small amount of alcohol over the
          shirt and temporarily puts the flask on the ground, but does
          not screw the cap on securely. He then wedges the lit Zippo
          between a small space between two wooden planks.
          With the snake situation handled, Paul finally lets out a
          sigh of relief. Rubs his eyes. Tries to regain his
          faculties. Looks over the list of phone numbers written
          above him.
          Suddenly, the cell phone vibrates. Paul frenziedly searches
          for it, but he cannot find it. He then notices it has fallen
          into the small hole near his feet, out of his reach.
          He makes several attempts to grab the phone with his feet,
          but he is unable to do so. It continues to ring.
          His next efforts involve repositioning himself in the coffin
          so that he completely turns to face the opposite end.

           55.

                         

                         
          Struggling through each move, Paul painstakingly begins to
          turn himself. While turning, however, he inadvertently kicks
          the Zippo from the side of the coffin -- landing it on the
          floor, up against the glow stick -- and knocks over the
          flask.
          We see that the flame of the Zippo slowly melts the plastic
          glow stick, causing it to dim slightly.
          Worst still, and completely unbeknownst to Paul, a stream of
          alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward the
          flame of the lighter, threatening to set the coffin ablaze.
          Inch by inch, the flammable spirit gets closer.
          Still in the midst of his repositioning, Paul looks back and
          sees the alcohol nearing the flame. In a panic, he attempts
          to reach and grab the Zippo. But, he finds himself stuck in
          the middle of the coffin. He can't budge either way.

                          PAUL
           No, no, no!!
          Desperately straining every muscle in his body, he extends
          his arm backward toward the Zippo, hoping to move it away
          from the spilled alcohol. He still can't reach it, yet he
          tries with all his might.
          The phone stops ringing. He has missed the call.
          He tries blowing at the flame, but his head is too far away
          and his breath is not strong enough to do much more than
          cause it to flicker.
          With the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame, Paul
          reaches for his shoe. His odd positioning makes reaching his
          foot almost impossible. He struggles to undo the laces and
          remove it from his foot.
          With his face beet red from the force of his strain, Paul
          finally removes his shoe. The mere inch of leg room this
          creates allows him to slide his leg out from under him.
          The trail of alcohol is just about to come into contact with
          the flame --
          -- but Paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to
          awkwardly kick the Zippo out of the way and close the lid.
          Paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the dim
          light of the damaged glow stick. He notices another hole in
          the coffin. As a precaution, he stuffs it with the cloth
          that had previously been used to gag him.

           56.

                         

                         
          Just as he is about to grab the phone, he hears what appears
          to be the faint sound of a Muslim call to prayer being
          announced over the citywide PA system. The sound barely
          makes its way through the hundreds of pounds of sand that
          envelop the coffin.
          A sign of hope, as well as a point of reference for his
          location -- albeit a very vague one.
          He listens further as the call to prayer continues. The
          light of the glow stick dims further.
          Paul then opens his phone. Sees that he missed Jabir's call.
          He starts to call Jabir back, but stops. He instead
          navigates through the various display menus. He soon reaches
          what appears to be the Tools Menu, though it's difficult to
          tell because everything is written in Arabic. He becomes
          frustrated as he fails to find what he is looking for.
          On the verge of mental surrender, he sees something that
          gives him pause. A smile crosses his face.

                          PAUL
           (re: the phone screen)
           There you are.
          We see, on the display of the phone, that Paul has found a
          listing of languages. He scrolls past many -- "FRANCAIS,
          DETSCHE, ESPANOL" -- stopping at "ENGLISH." Presses the
          button, instantly making all the text on the screen readable.
          He quickly navigates to the Tools menu. Scrolls down.
          Locates the number of the cell phone he is using.
          He scribbles the number onto the top of the coffin. Then a
          second pass, making it bolder than the others.
          Paul then dials his wife's cell phone. After only a few
          rings, he is met by her voice mail.

           LINDA (V.O.)
           Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a
           message. Thanks and have a great
           day.
          The beep sounds, and Paul frantically proceeds right into his
          message.

                          PAUL
           Linda, here's the number for the
           phone. I just found it out. It's
           07902-42-884. You have to use the
           international calling code first.

           57.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Please call me as soon as you get
           this. I love you...I love you.
           Call me right away. Please.
          Paul hangs up. He looks at the battery life left on the
          phone. One bar. He then checks his watch. It's 8:19pm.
          Both are not good signs, and he knows it.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Oh shit.
          He begins to panic. Grabbing the pocket knife that was left
          inside the metal box, he slides the blade in the space
          between the sides of the coffin and the top.
          Paul grabs the glow stick. But, because it was partially
          melted to the floor, the stick snaps in two. Liquid oozes
          out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck the
          floor.

                          PAUL
           Son of a...
          Paul grabs the flashlight. Turns it on. It works for a
          second, but then goes out. Shaking it only produces
          intermittent beams of light.
          He turns the top, switching to the red bulb. It works. The
          coffin fills with a reddish hue, but then it, too, goes out.
          Growing incensed, Paul switches back to the white bulb. It
          works.
          He returns his attention to the coffin. His efforts to use
          the knife as a fulcrum are futile. Still, he tries. Bending
          the blade well past its design, it nearly breaks off its
          handle.
          The flashlight turns off. After a good shaking, it turns
          back on, emitting white light.
          With oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this kind
          are all too much for Paul to take. He has to stop and try to
          catch his breath.
          As he endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone rings.
          Not a call this time, but instead a video message. It has
          been sent by Jabir.
          Paul's trepidation is evident. He fears what the incoming
          video may show.

           58.

                         

                         
          After a beat, he presses the Accept button and the video
          downloads. Within seconds, the video plays on his phone
          display screen. We see, in the video, the American Woman
          that previously appeared in a picture message that was sent
          to Paul. She is still bound at her wrists, but her gag has
          been lowered.
          She sits on her knees. Standing behind her are three men,
          all with their faces shielded by Arab headdresses. They each
          hold AK-47 assault weapons.
          Paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks, through
          her tears, into the camera.

                          WOMAN
           My name is Pamela Gorham. I'm a
           food service worker at F.O.B.
           Anaconda, employed by Crestin,
           Roland and Thomas. My captors'
           requests for ransom have gone
           unanswered, and --
          The Woman, Pamela, looks off-screen to her right. Someone is
          fast approaching her. She cowers, protectively holding her
          bound hands in front of her face as she screams.

                          WOMAN (CONT'D)
           (to the person)
           No...wait!! Please -- no!!
          Another Iraqi man steps into the camera's line of site, a
          handgun already brandished.
          Without as much as a moment's hesitation, he fires two rounds
          directly into Pamela's head, killing her.

                         
          The video message ends immediately thereafter. Paul is in
          complete shock.
          He screams aloud, slamming his closed fist against the bottom
          of the coffin.

                          PAUL
           No! No, no, no!!!
          Still in the throes of emotional torment, Paul vomits on
          himself. He doubles over, only to vomit once again.
          His body, taxed almost to the point of complete physical
          breakdown, gradually slows and levels itself. With his vomit-
          smeared face pressed cheek-down onto the bottom of the
          coffin, Paul stares into nothingness.

           59.

                         

                         
          After a beat, his eye catches a glimmer of light -- the blade
          of the knife, reflecting off the beam of the flashlight.
          Paul reaches for the knife. Lying on his back, still
          suffering enormous mental strain, he places the cutting edge
          of the blade against his neck. His jugular vein.
          His hand shakes, his lips tremble.
          The hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the
          handle. It, too, shakes.
          Paul closes his eyes.
          A small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his
          neck, where the blade of the knife rests, ready to open his
          vein.

                         
          After a great deal of consideration, Paul throws the knife to
          the foot of the coffin.
          He can't do it.
          The flashlight falls from Paul's chest. It turns off upon
          landing on the floor of the coffin.
          Paul sits in darkness. His breaths echo off the coffin
          walls.
          After a beat, he turns on the flashlight. It turns off after
          less than two seconds. This time, however, he does not shake
          it, nor does he hit it.
          A moment later, we hear a click, followed by the sight of a
          red light beam emitting from the flashlight. It holds
          steady.

                         
          Paul shines it onto the names and phone numbers written on
          the top of the coffin. He stops at "MARK WHITE."
          After a beat, he lowers the flashlight to his side.
          He picks up the phone and dials Brenner. After one ring,
          Brenner answers. He's clearly not pleased. Paul, however,
          is surprisingly calm. Detached. Almost disturbingly so.

                          DAN
           Why the hell did you make that
           video?

                          PAUL
           It's all a bunch of lies.

           60.

                         

                         

                          DAN
          What is? What are you talking
          about?

                          PAUL
          All of it.

                          DAN
          All of what?

                          PAUL
          Nobody gives a shit about any of
          us. We're nothing to you people.

                          DAN
          We're going to find you.

                         

                          PAUL
          By looking the other way?

                          DAN
          You can't start breaking on me now,
          Paul. You have to stay strong.

                          PAUL
          You let her die.

                          DAN
           (after a beat)
          No I didn't.

                          PAUL
          They shot her...and you didn't do
          anything.

                          DAN
          We didn't even know she had been
          taken hostage.

                          PAUL
          She sent three videos.

                          DAN
          That's what they told her to say.

                          PAUL
          Why?

                          DAN
          I don't know.

                          PAUL
          What do you know?

           61.

                         

                         

                          DAN
          That your ransom video already has
          47,000 hits on YouTube. And all
          the major networks are playing it,
          including Al Jazeera. So, now your
          captors have no choice but to
          follow through.

                          PAUL
          I found out the number to this
          phone.

                          DAN
          How?

                          PAUL
          I found a way to change the display
          language. I figured that out, and
          you didn't. Why?

                          DAN
          Because I didn't. Just like you
          and every other person on this
          planet, there are some things I
          know and some things I don't.

                          PAUL
          Then how are you ever going to find
          me?

                          DAN
          Their signal was cloned, like we
          figured. But, we're close. Real
          close.

                          PAUL
          What about mine?

                          DAN
          We're working on that, too.

                          PAUL
          I'm near a Mosque. I could hear
          the call to prayer over the P.A.

                          DAN
          Good. That means that we're in the
          right area.

                          PAUL
          You're nearby?

           62.

                         

                         

                          DAN
           I spoke with soldiers from the
           third ID who were escorting your
           convoy.

                          PAUL
           They're alive?
          After a beat:

                          DAN
           Not all of them. Both Bradley
           tanks were hit with IEDs. The rest
           got caught in small arms fire.

                          (BEAT)
           What the hell happened out there,
           Paul?

                         
          Paul doesn't answer at first.

                          DAN (CONT'D)
           Paul.
          After a beat:

                          PAUL
           We had just left Anaconda,
           everything seemed okay. We knew
           that a bunch of our CB radios had
           been stolen and that the Iraqis
           were listening in, so we made sure
           to switch from our usual channels.
           Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the
           convoy commander. She wanted to
           ride with me like she usually did
           when she hitched a ride from base,
           but it seemed safer for her to be
           with the C.C. As we headed down
           the road, all these kids came
           running into the street. Dozens of
           them. It almost seemed like they
           were expecting us, except we got
           there faster than they thought we
           would. So they run on up in front
           of me, and I slam on my brakes.
           The rest of the drivers were
           already further up ahead, so they
           kept going. Next thing I know, one
           of the lead trucks got hit by an
           IED. I hear Tommy Wilkes on the
           radio saying, Sandman's hit,
           Sandman's hit. He's...he's
           everywhere.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           That's when the Iraqis came out of
           their mud huts from the side of the
           road and started shooting
           everybody. I couldn't believe what
           was happening. It seemed like slow-
           motion, like I was watching it on
           TV. People -- my friends -- were
           getting killed, and all I could do
           is watch. I didn't even notice
           that the kids were throwing bricks
           and rocks at me until one split my
           windshield. Sort of snapped me out
           of my trance. But then, I guess I
           got hit in the head with a rock,
           `cause I blacked out.

                          DAN
           Do you happen to remem...mo...
           nea...
          The cell phone service begins to cut out. Suddenly, the
          coffin begins to vibrate slightly, dropping sand granules
          through the crack and onto the wood bottom, followed by the
          faint sound of an explosion.
          Within seconds, the explosions grow louder and more
          proximate. The vibration becomes so intense that it
          violently shakes Paul around the coffin.
          The sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above,
          flying by as the massive explosions continue.
          Sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of
          the coffin as it shakes. Paul does his best to brace
          himself, but the bombardment is far too powerful.

                         
          A large crack forms in the wooden cover to the coffin,
          spanning almost its entire length. Sand immediately pours
          through the concave shaped crack, seeping in onto Paul like
          an hourglass.
          Fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the
          immense pressure from the sand above, Paul positions himself
          underneath it and presses with all his might. He grunts and
          screams loudly, using what little strength he has left to
          keep the top from caving.
          The shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand
          continues.

           64.

                         

                         
          In efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any
          faster, Paul removes the button-down shirt from the hole and
          stuffs into the area where it enters with the greatest
          volume. He removes the balled-up cloth from the other hole
          and does the same with it. Both offer very little help.
          The flashlight falls to the floor. The red light beam turns
          off. Darkness. The sound of sand steadily pouring down.

                          PAUL

                          (EXHAUSTED)
           Oh no...no...
          Paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting. White
          light shines, but then goes out. He shakes the flashlight
          and it stays on, shining its normal white beam.

                         
          He assesses his situation, noticing that the coffin is
          already filled with a small layer of sand; a situation that
          is only going to get worse with time.

                          PAUL
           This can't be happening.
          We see that Dan Brenner is no longer on the phone, and that
          the display menu shows an icon of a phone with a line through
          it -- No Service Available.
          Once he feels it is secure enough, Paul slowly moves his body
          away from the crack. Although slightly caved, it does not
          show any more signs of possible collapse.
          Sweat drenches his face. His eyes affixed, in utter
          disbelief, on the sand as it spills into the coffin, filling
          in around him inch-by-inch.

                         
          He grabs the cell phone, only to see that he does not have a
          signal.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           No. Come on. Please work.
          He shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coffin,
          hoping that it may somehow help. His efforts are futile.
          The flashlight goes dead. He hits it, shakes it. It turns
          back on. The brightness is diminished.
          Still the sand continues to fall, drowning him deeper and
          deeper in a pool of granules.
          Then, very surprisingly, the cell phone rings. Paul answers
          right away.

           65.

                          (FRANTICALLY)
           Hello? Hello? Who's there?
          Alan Davenport answers calmly from the other end.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Is this Paul Conroy?

                          PAUL
           Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are
           you?

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Paul, my name's Alan Davenport, I'm
           the personnel director here at
           Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

                         

                          PAUL
           I left you a message.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           You did. I also heard from Rebecca
           Browning over at the State
           Department. Are you able to speak
           on the status of your situation?

                          PAUL
           It's worse. There was an explosion
           or something. The coffin's
           breaking, there's sand pouring in
           from everywhere. I only have a
           half an hour before --

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Okay, okay. Slow down. You should
           try to stay calm. Tell me
           something, Paul, who have you
           spoken to?

                          PAUL
           The hostage takers, Dan Brenner
           from the hostage working group --

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Okay, Paul. I'm with you. How
           about the media. I know your
           ransom video leaked, but have you
           spoken directly to anyone about
           what's going on?
          The flashlight goes out. Paul hits it a few times and it
          turns back on.

           66.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           No.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           That's good. It needs to stay that
           way. It's important that we keep
           this situation as contained as
           possible.
          Paul finds Alan's obvious concern with doing damage control
          to be infuriating.

                          PAUL
           About three inches to my right,
           there's a wall. Three inches to my
           left, there's another wall. And
           about four inches above my head,
           there's a roof that's about to
           collapse and drown me in sand. I
           think this situation is pretty
           contained.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           I know you're upset --

                          PAUL
           Help me! Help me! What are you
           going to do to help me?!

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           I know you're upset. And, from
           what I've been told, steps are
           being taken to get you out of
           there. So, hopefully it won't be
           much longer.

                         

                          PAUL
           Thank God.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Yes, thank God.

                          (BEAT)
           I'm going to switch on a recorder
           right now. Just a second...
          Paul's visage expresses his confusion.
          A click is heard in the b.g. of Alan's phone, followed by a
          low, steady hum.
          Alan's speech becomes very laconic. His questions are
          clearly being read from a Human Resources handbook of some
          kind.

           67.

                         

                         

           ALAN DAVENPORT (CONT'D)
           This is Alan Davenport, Personnel
           Director for Crestin, Roland and
           Thomas, Incorporated. The date is
           October 23, 2006. I am speaking
           with Paul Conroy. Mister Conroy,
           are you aware that I'm recording
           this conversation?

                          PAUL
           What...?

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Please answer the question.
          The flashlight goes out again.

                         

                          PAUL
           Shit.
          Paul hits it, but it does not catch. He sits in darkness.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Mister Conroy?

                          PAUL
           Yes. Yes!

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           And do I have your permission to do
           so?

                          PAUL
           Why do you need my permission?
           What is all this?

                         

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           I need you to answer yes or no,
           please.

                          PAUL
           Yes. Alright? Yes!
          Paul hits the flashlight. It turns back on.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Thank you. Now, Mister Conroy,
           when were you hired by CRT?

                          PAUL
           About nine months ago. Around
           January of 2005. Why are you
           wasting time with this?

           68.

                         

                         

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           I have your official date of hire
           as January 4th, 2005. Is that
           correct?

                          PAUL
           Who cares? This is fucking crazy --

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           January 4th, 2005. Is that
           correct?

                          PAUL
           Yes!

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           And during your initial training,
           before being sent to Iraq, were you
           made aware of the dangers inherent
           to the position for which you were
           hired.

                          PAUL
           You mean when I came down there to
           Dallas and you guys said that all
           of the trucks would be armored and
           have bulletproof glass?
          The flashlight dims. Paul angrily shakes it, returning it to
          full strength.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You mean when you told us that
           things were safer than ever over
           here? Is that when I was made
           aware?

                         

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           I need you to answer yes or no,
           please.

                          PAUL

                          (BEAT)
           Yes.
          The flashlight begins to slowly dim.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           During that time, did you also
           receive and sign an employment
           contract with CRT, which thoroughly
           explained company policy as it
           pertained to your specific terms of
           employment?

           69.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Yeah, I signed a bunch of things.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Yes or no.

                          PAUL
           Yes. I signed the contract. Yes!

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           It's our understanding that you
           were taken hostage in Iraq two
           hours ago, is that also correct?

                          PAUL
           Yes. That's completely correct.
           What is the point of all this?

                         
          Alan breaks from the H.R. handbook script, though his tone
          remains just as matter-of-fact. The flashlight continues its
          steady, slow dim.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Our legal department requires that
           we obtain a sworn affidavit from
           employees, confirming that they
           understand the reasons for their
           forced separation from the company.
           As of this morning, your employment
           with CRT was officially terminated.

                          PAUL
           Wait, wait, wait --
          The flashlight dims even more.

                         

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           It was brought to our attention
           that you were engaging in relations
           with a fellow CRT employee --
           Pamela Gorham.

                          PAUL
           No. Wait --

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Stipulated in your contract was a
           fraternization clause, in which it
           was stated quite clearly that any
           relationship, be it romantic or
           sexual in nature, deemed
           inappropriate by CRT senior
           officials is grounds for immediate
           termination.

           70.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           We...we were just friends.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Our records indicate differently.

                          PAUL
           This is bullshit.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           We're also legally required to
           inform you that because you were
           technically no longer under the
           employ of CRT at the time of your
           abduction, we cannot be held
           accountable for any injury that may
           befall upon you after your official
           date and time of termination.
           Therefore, in your case, that
           includes this incident or any
           consequences that may result from
           it.
          Paul sees where Alan is going with this. He's thunderstruck.

                          PAUL
           What about my insurance money? My
           family will need that money...

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Given that you were alive up until
           the time of your termination --

                          PAUL
           You son of a bitch. You can't do
           this.

                         

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Do you understand everything --

                          PAUL
           You can't do this!
          Alan takes a second before trying again.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           Do you understand everything
           you've been told, Mister Conroy?
          Paul does not answer.

           ALAN DAVENPORT (CONT'D)
           Mister Conroy?

           71.

                         

                         
          After a long beat:

                          PAUL
           Go to hell.

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           That concludes our interview with
           Paul Conroy. I am now turning off
           the recorder.
          A click is heard. The humming ceases.

                          PAUL
           You people can't just wash your
           hands of this. You bastards put me
           here.

                         

                          ALAN DAVENPORT
           I'm sorry.
          Alan ends the call.
          Paul looks at the phone -- it is still holding a steady
          signal. Battery life, however, is running quite low. All
          that remains is one blinking bar, indicating that Paul has
          very little battery life left.
          He shakes his hand free of the pile of sand that now covers
          it and looks at his watch. It's 8:31pm.
          The flashlight bulb dims until it goes out completely. Only
          the light of the cell phone display lights the coffin.

                          PAUL
           Come on...

                         
          Wasting little time, Paul dials Jabir. The phone rings and
          rings, but Jabir does not answer. Checking to make sure the
          he dialed the correct number, Paul matches it against the
          phone number he wrote onto the wall of the coffin.
          Seeing that he did, in fact, dial correctly, Paul again tries
          to call Jabir. While he waits through the many rings, he
          tries relighting the Zippo. Spark...spark...it catches.
          No one answers. Paul's disquietude is evident in his
          increasingly erratic behavior.

                          PAUL
           Answer the phone!!
          Paul tries Jabir once again, but still he does not answer the
          phone.

           72.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           (desperate, exhausted)
           Why won't you answer?!!
          It's then that something occurs to Paul. He stares at the
          crack in the top of the coffin and the sand that pours in at
          an alarmingly fast rate.
          The crack has split Jabir's written phone number in half.
          The aerial bombing. He wonders how it may have affected
          Jabir and, consequently, his own chances of survival. He
          places his hand under the point from where the sand pours in
          most, allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through his
          fingers.
          The flickering Zippo flame tells of the diminished amount of
          oxygen.
          Paul attempts to control his breathing, realizing full well
          that there are not many more breaths he will be able to take.
          He then calls Dan Brenner. After a few rings, Brenner
          answers.
          Paul is surprisingly serene.

                          DAN
           Paul, is that you?

                          PAUL
           They're dead.

                          DAN
           How do you know that?

                         

                          PAUL
           I just do.

                          DAN
           Three F-16s levelled parts of the
           city a few minutes ago.

                          PAUL
           I know. I felt it. Did they know
           I was here?
          The Zippo flame flutters. Weakens.

                          DAN
           (after a beat)
           Yeah.

           73.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Did they care?
          Dan does not answer.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           These people that took me -- if
           they're dead, they can't tell you
           where I am.

                          DAN
           We can still try to track down your
           signal.

                          PAUL
           You tried that already.

                         

                          DAN
           We can try again.
          Paul appreciates Dan's effort, but he knows there is little
          hope left for him.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           It's over, isn't it?
          After a long beat:

                          DAN
           No.
          Paul doesn't say a word. He knows that Dan is lying. After
          a beat, Dan comes clean.

                          DAN (CONT'D)
           Yeah.

                         
          The flame of the Zippo becomes smaller. It clearly has
          little life left.

                          PAUL
           What should I do?

                          DAN
           I don't know.

                          PAUL
           That's right -- just like everyone
           else on the planet, there are some
           things you know and some things you
           don't.

           74.

                         

                         

                          DAN
           I wish this could have gone
           differently.

                          PAUL
           Yeah...me too.
          After a long beat, Paul ends the call. He forces a smile to
          his lachrymose face.
          Utterly hopeless, he opens the phone and turns on the video
          feature. He turns the phone to face himself, projecting his
          image on the display.
          He presses Record.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           This is Paul Steven Conroy. Social
           Security number 048-32-1198, date
           of birth 3/19/68. This video will
           serve as my last will and
           testament. To my wife, Linda
           Conroy, I leave the seven hundred
           dollars in my personal savings and
           whatever I have left in my annuity.
           To my son, Shane Conroy, I...I
           don't know. I don't have anything
           else. My stuff, like, my clothes.
           I wish I had more...I wish I had
           done more. Your dad wasn't really
           much of anything, Shane, I'm sorry.
           Maybe if I was a famous baseball
           player, or a guy who wore a suit to
           work, I would have more to leave
           you. But, you can be one of those
           people if you want. You can be
           whatever you want. Just promise me
           that when you get older, you'll
           take good care of your mom. And
           promise me that you'll always try
           to do the right thing, no matter
           what. I love you very much, Shane.
           Maybe I never said that
           enough...maybe I did, I don't even
           know. That probably means I
           didn't.

                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry, Linda. I should have
           listened to you.
          Paul ends the video and closes the phone. He carefully
          places the phone into his pocket, where it may hopefully be
          found if he ever is.

           75.

                         

                         
          He lays back, staring at the almost completely extinguished
          Zippo flame, as the sand continues to rain on him.
          Down and down it pours, the sands of time passing might and
          main through the cracks.
          The Zippo flame goes out. Paul sits in the darkness,
          resigned to what apparently will be his fate.
          Hold on black for several seconds...until --
          -- suddenly, from inside Paul's pocket, he hears a faint
          vibration. It's the cell phone. He looks at the number of
          who is calling him. Shines the light of the cell phone on
          the list of numbers written on the top of the coffin. He
          can't believe what he's seeing.

                         
          Paul answers immediately.

                          PAUL
           You're not dead.
          Jabir is heard speaking frantically in Arabic to the several
          other people in the room with him.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Hello? Hello?!
          Jabir turns his attention to Paul.

                          JABIR
           Where is money?

                          PAUL
           I don't know.

                         

                          JABIR
           What don't know?

                          PAUL
           I don't know where the money is.

                          JABIR
           Liar!

                          PAUL
           I'm not lying! I swear.

                          JABIR
           Swear?

                          PAUL
           I'm telling the truth.

           76.

                         

                         
          Sounding panicked, Jabir again speaks in Arabic to the other
          people in the room with him. They respond accordingly.
          Paul tries to turn on the flashlight. It doesn't work.
          Jabir returns his scornful attention to Paul.

                          JABIR
           From Embassy, you get money now!

                          PAUL
           I can't!

                          JABIR
           You will!!

                          PAUL
           I need more time. Please.
          Paul shakes and hits the flashlight. It still does not work.

                          JABIR
           No more time!

                          PAUL
           There's sand pouring in here. I
           can't...it's everywhere. Please,
           let me out of here and I will get
           you the money.
          Jabir utters something in Arabic to someone standing next to
          him, seemingly asking a question and getting an answer from
          the same individual.
          Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight. Switches the
          positioning of the batteries. Screws the cap back on. Hits
          the switch.
          Nothing.
          Jabir returns to the phone.

                          JABIR (CONT'D)
           You show blood.

                          PAUL
           What?
          Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight again. Removes the
          batteries. Bites down on them a few times. Blows hard
          inside the flashlight tube.

                          JABIR
           You show blood, they give money.

           77.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           No.

                          JABIR
           You cut off thumb finger, send
           video.

                          PAUL
           I'm not doing that.

                          JABIR
           Yes!
          Paul puts the batteries back inside the flashlight. Begins
          screwing on the cap.

                          PAUL
           No.

                          JABIR
           No?

                          PAUL
           That's right, no. You let me out
           of here, and I'll cut off my whole
           God damn hand if you want.
          Jabir again says something to someone in the room with him,
          returning to Paul after a brief moment.
          Paul finishes closing the top of the flashlight.

                          JABIR
           You have wife?
          Click. The flashlight turns on!

                         
          Paul considers Jabir's question to be a potential sign of
          compassion.

                          PAUL
           Yes, I do. And a son. A young
           son. I want to go home...to see
           them. Please, sir.

                          JABIR
           Sir?

                          PAUL
           Yes. Sir. I say that out of
           respect...to you.

           78.

                         

                         

                          JABIR
           243 East Walnut Street. Hastings,
           Michigan. U.S.A.

                          PAUL

                          (CONCERNED)
           That's my...why did you say that?

                          JABIR
           You show blood...or they show
           blood.

                          PAUL
           That's...you're lying. You're
           nobody...all of you. You can't get
           to them.

                         

                          JABIR
           No?

                          PAUL
           No. You're peasants, criminals,
           that's all. You don't even know
           where Michigan is.

                          JABIR
           Detroit. Ann Arbor.
          Even this basic knowledge is enough to make Jabir's threats
          that much more real.

                          PAUL
           You looked at a map. That's all
           you did.

                          JABIR
           You show blood, or they show blood.
           Send video by five minutes.
          Jabir ends the call. Realizing that Jabir is gone, Paul
          quickly dials his wife's cell phone.
          After several rings, her voice mail picks up.

           LINDA (V.O.)
           Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a
           message. Thanks and have a great
           day.

                          PAUL

                          (FRANTICALLY)
           Linda, listen to me: you and Shane
           have to go somewhere... anywhere.

                          (MORE)

           79.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Don't stay at the house, whatever
           you do, do not stay at the house.
           The guy...the kidnapper, he knows
           our address. He stole my license
           and now he knows where we live. Go
           to the Sheriff's station if you
           have to, just don't go home.
          Paul hangs up. He takes a moment to look around, noticing
          that the coffin is almost halfway filled with sand.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           (re: the sand)
           Holy God.
          Paul then dials Dan Brenner. After only one ring, the call
          goes directly to voice mail.

                         
          The flashlight starts to dim. Paul shakes it, causing it to
          regain its strength.

                          DAN
           This is Daniel Brenner. Please
           leave a message at the tone.
          The beep sounds. Paul delivers a frenzied message.

                          PAUL
           Brenner, where are you?! He's
           alive! He just called me! Call me
           right away! The fucking guy is
           still alive!
          Paul hangs up the phone.
          Unsure what to do next, Paul's heartbeat races. He fidgets,
          nervously shaking and tapping his thumb against the phone.
          He questions the validity of Jabir's threats toward his
          family.

                          PAUL

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           They can't find them.
           They...can't. There's no way.
          Paul opens the phone and brings up the photo of Pamela, bound
          and gagged. The image causes Paul to second guess himself.
          The flashlight goes out. The cell phone's display
          illuminates Paul's face.

           80.

                         

                         
          He then replays the video in which Pamela is seen being shot.
          Reliving the experience is extremely painful, though his
          concern is more on his own family at this point. However,
          the video is enough to convince Paul of Jabir and his
          cohort's convictions.
          Paul tries the Zippo. Nothing. Only sparks. He tosses it
          aside.
          His breathing grows erratic and labored. His eyes dart from
          side-to-side, his throat groans involuntary noises of fear.
          Paul then looks at the knife, and then at his watch. He has
          less than two minutes to send the video to Jabir.
          Fearing for the safety of his family, he must meet Jabir's
          demands.

                         
          He hits the flashlight a few times. Click. It turns on.
          Paul opens the phone and sets it to take video. He places it
          flat onto the surface of the sand, which by this point is
          already filling the coffin halfway. He then reaches for the
          knife.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. Oh my God.
          He places his hands against the side of the coffin, spreading
          his fingers. He stares intently at his thumb.
          With the extremely sharp knife in hand, Paul slowly lowers it
          just above his thumb. He inhales and exhales deep breaths,
          almost hyperventilating.

                          PAUL(CONT'D)
           Holy shit.
          Paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expired
          glow sticks. He shakes the sand off of it and places it
          across his mouth, biting into it hard.
          His heart races, his breaths are the deepest he's ever taken.
          After placing the flashlight on the ground, to ensure that
          the camera picks up the image, he presses the record button
          on the cell phone.
          Grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a
          primordial scream, Paul closes his eyes and chops down with
          the knife.
          We see, through the display screen of the phone, Paul sever
          his thumb with a swift chop of the blade.

           81.

                         

                         
          A small spray of blood spatters onto his face as he screams
          out in unfathomable pain.
          He falls to his side, still screaming and writhing. He
          reaches for his discarded outer-shirt, which is still stuffed
          in the crack to help slow the influx of sand. Removing the
          shirt from the crack instantly causes the sand to fall into
          the coffin more rapidly.
          Paul wraps the shirt around his hand. The blood quickly soaks
          right through it.
          He is fading fast. His blood loss is great. Shock sets in.
          He musters up the strength to send the video to Jabir.
          To secure his shirt over the wound, Paul removes his belt
          from his waist and pulls it tight over his wrap.

                         
          Growing increasingly more pale, Paul teeters on the verge of
          consciousness. Everything becomes blurry to him.
          The phone falls from his hand. He shivers. His lips turn a
          light shade of purple and his face ash white. Everything
          becomes more and more blurry. He fights with every last
          ounce of strength to remain conscious.
          While laying against the side of the coffin, the phone
          vibrates once again. To Paul, the vibration against the wood
          seems so distant, so foreign. The vibration grows louder and
          louder in his mind, sounding more and more like the sound of
          rotating helicopter blades.
          He then hears what sounds like VOICES, yelling from on top of
          the coffin.

                          VOICE #1
           He's down here!

                          VOICE #2
           Get him out! Keep digging!

                          VOICE #3
           Paul, we're here!
          The cacophony of voices form a mosaic of sound in Paul's
          head, each overlapping the other in distant echoes. Shovels,
          digging deep into the ground, are heard banging against the
          top of the coffin.
          The top of the coffin is torn open, sending a brilliant ray
          of white light onto Paul. He stares into the light, crying,
          eking out a tortured smile.

           82.

                         

                         
          Suddenly, Paul is back in the same predicament. The voices,
          the shovels, the light -- it was all a hallucination, brought
          upon by his loss of blood.
          He's still alone. He's still in the coffin, which continues
          to fill up with sand. He is too exhausted to display his
          disappointment.
          The phone continues to vibrate. It soon stops. Paul is in
          too poor condition to show any concern.
          After a beat, the phone begins vibrating once again. After
          several rings, Paul languidly picks it up. He barely
          recognizes the number through his extremely blurred vision.
          He's so weak, he's barely able to formulate words. He spits
          out stray particles of sand from his mouth.

                         

                          PAUL
           Yeah?

                          DAN
           Paul, it's Brenner.
          Paul doesn't have the strength to answer.

                          DAN (CONT'D)
           Paul? Are you there? Paul?

                          PAUL
           I'm...here.

                          DAN
           We're coming for you now. You hear
           me? We know where you are.

                         
          This news serves as somewhat of an adrenaline rush for Paul,
          who musters up even the modicum of strength he seemingly did
          not have left in him.

                          PAUL
           You're coming?

                          DAN
           We are, Paul. We're almost there
           now.

                          PAUL
           How do you know?

                          DAN
           Coalition forces picked up a Shiite
           insurgent just outside of Baghdad.

                          (MORE)

           83.

                          DAN (CONT'D)
           Said he knew where an American was
           buried alive. He agreed to show us
           where if we let him go.

                          PAUL
           You're coming for me?

                          DAN
           We're practically there already.
          An impossible smile fights its way to Paul's lips. His
          momentary joy is just that, however, for the sand has almost
          completely filled the coffin by this point.

                          PAUL
           You have to hurry.

                         

                          DAN
           We are.

                          PAUL
           No...you have to hurry. The
           sand...it's filling up fast.

                          DAN
           Just hang in there for three more
           minutes. This will all be over
           soon, I promise.
          Paul is very hopeful that Dan is correct in his assumption.

                          PAUL
           Okay. I believe you. Thank you.
           Thank you.
          A beep is heard. Paul has another call coming in. He's
          visibly elated upon seeing who it is.

                          DAN
           Three minutes. Try to --

                          PAUL
           I have to go!

                          DAN
           Paul, no --

                          PAUL
           Call me right back.

                          DAN
           Paul!

           84.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           Call me right back.
          Paul switches to the other call, despite the fact that he has
          a mere eight inches left before the entire coffin is filled
          with sand from top-to-bottom.
          He holds the flashlight just above the top of the sand pile,
          allowing it to illuminate what little unoccupied area
          remains.

                          PAUL
           Linda.
          Linda is in hysterics, which is evident in her speech.

                          LINDA
           Paul? Paul is that you? Tell me
           it's you.

                          PAUL
           It's me, sweetie.

                          LINDA
           Oh my God, Paul! What are they
           doing to you? Please tell me
           you're okay.

                          PAUL
           I'm...okay.

                          LINDA
           I just saw the news. What...oh my
           God, baby.
          The flashlight dims. Paul shakes it, regaining a bit of its
          strength.

                          PAUL
           It's going to be okay now.

                          LINDA
           I missed all your calls. I left my
           cell phone at home. I just found
           out what was going on.

                          PAUL
           That's okay. It's all okay.
           They're getting me out.

                          LINDA
           Who?

           85.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           The people. Americans. They found
           out where I am and they're on their
           way to get me.

                          LINDA

                          (ELATED)
           They are? Oh thank God. Oh dear
           God, thank you.
          The flashlight flickers. Paul hits it. It flickers some
          more.

                          PAUL
           It's all going to be okay.

                          LINDA
           How do you know for sure? Oh God,
           please tell me you're okay.
          The flashlight continues to flicker almost like a
          stroboscopic light from this point forward.

                          PAUL
           I'm okay.

                          LINDA
           I was so afraid I was going to lose
           you.

                          PAUL
           You're not.
          Linda breaks down in joyous tears.

                          LINDA
           I love you so much. I love you so,
           so much.

                          PAUL

                          (WELLING UP)
           I love you, too.

                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry. I should have listened
           to you.

                          LINDA
           It doesn't matter.

                          PAUL
           I should have never come here. You
           were right. I'm sorry.

           86.

                         

                         

                          LINDA
           Sweetie, I don't care. I just want
           you home. Please come home to me.

                          PAUL
           I will.

                          LINDA
           Swear it.

                          PAUL
           I will. I swear I will.
          Paul then receives a call on the other line. He checks to
          see who's calling. It's Dan Brenner.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           They're here!

                          LINDA
           The people?

                          PAUL
           They're calling me right now. I
           have to go.

                          LINDA
           Call me right away.

                          PAUL
           I will. I love you.

                          LINDA
           I love you. Swear it again.

                          PAUL
           I swear. I have to go.
          Paul clicks over to the other line, where Dan Brenner waits
          to speak with him.
          We hear Dan yelling to people who are with him. A great deal
          of commotion and action is heard through the phone.

                          DAN
           Move! Move! Let's go.

                          PAUL
           Brenner?

                          DAN
           Paul? Paul?

           87.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           It's me.

                          DAN
           We're here!
          Dan yells to one of the soldiers who are with him.

                          DAN (CONT'D)
           Corporal, get your men over here!
          Dan gets back on the phone with Paul

                          DAN (CONT'D)
           He brought us right to you.

                          DAN (CONT'D)
           (to the soldiers)
           Start digging! Let's go, let's go!
          The flashlight fades. Paul hits it, momentarily returning it
          to full strength.
          Meanwhile, the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the
          very top. It continues to pour in from the crack, seemingly
          faster than ever.
          Paul struggles to keep his head above the sand, giving him
          only a few inches between his face and the top of the coffin.

                          PAUL
           You have to hurry. It's almost
           full.

                          DAN
           Just hang in there!

                         

                          PAUL
           Hurry! Please!

                          DAN
           (to the soldiers)
           Dig! Dig! Dig!
          Paul fights to keep his head above the sand. The flashlight
          dims.

                          PAUL
           I can't...are you close?

                          DAN
           We're almost there, Paul. We're
           almost there!
           (to the soldiers)

                          (MORE)

           88.

                          DAN (CONT'D)
           Faster!

                          (TO PAUL)
           We're almost there. We're right
           above you.
          The level of sand grows even higher. Paul spits away falling
          sand that threatens to suffocate him.

                          PAUL
           I can't hear you! Where are you?

                          DAN
           We're almost there.
          A SOLDIER is heard OFF-SCREEN in the b.g. of Dan's phone.

           SOLDIER (O.S.)
           There it is!

                          DAN
           (to the soldiers)
           Keep digging!!

                          PAUL
           Hurry! Please!!!

                          DAN
           We see the coffin! Just hang in
           there!!
          Paul coughs out sand. He has a mere inch left above his
          head.

                          PAUL
           Hurry! Where are you? I don't
           hear you? Please hurry!!!

                         
          The Soldier is again heard OFF-SCREEN in the b.g. Of Dan's
          phone.

                          SOLDIER
           It's clear!

                          DAN
           (to the soldier)
           Open it!
          Nondescript noise is heard through the phone, until it comes
          to an abrupt stop.

                          DAN

                          (SHOCKED)
           Oh my God.

           89.

                         

                         

                          PAUL
           What is it?!

                          DAN
           I'm so sorry, Paul.

                          PAUL
           What?!!

                          DAN
           It's Mark White. He brought us to
           Mark White. I'm --
          We see the circled name of "MARK WHITE" written in capital
          letters on the top of the coffin.

                          PAUL
           You said...!

                          DAN

                          (OVERLAPPING)
           ...I know. I'm sorry.

                          PAUL
           No.

                          DAN
           I'm so sorry.

                          PAUL
           No!! No!! NO!!!
          The battery life on Paul's phone runs out, causing it to
          power down. The filament of the flashlight bulb burns out.
          As it does, the sand finally consumes the coffin, filling it
          completely.

                         
          We hear Paul's muffled screams emanate through the sand,
          until we no longer hear them at all.

           FADE OUT.

                         OVER BLACK

                          DAN
           I'm sorry, Paul. I'm so sorry.

                         

                         

                          THE END

          Pitch black. We hear FOOTSTEPS sneaking up an old wooden
          staircase. Two people moving as one.
                         
          Topping the stairs, they creep down the hall to the closed
          door that protects us. We can hear them behind it,
          whispering, bickering insanely, one shushing the other.
                         
          The squeak of a door knob slowly turning. The faint click of
          the latch. And the door inches open, throwing a razor-thin
          shaft of light into the darkness where it illuminates a

          As a ten-year-old GIRL sits up in bed. Dead tired. Staring
          at the two dark faces peering in at her.
                         
                          GIRL
           I can see you...
                         
          And the door closes, leaving us once more in total darkness.
          We can hear them bickering again as they shuffle away, their
          footsteps descending the stairs, fading into the uneasy
          silence of this old house...
                         
          INT. FIFTH GRADE CLASSROOM, LOS ANGELES - DAY
                         
          A young teacher (DARLA) chalks a lesson on a blackboard in a
          sun-drenched Los Angeles classroom.
                         
                          DARLA
           -- and we know from yesterday that the
           base of a triangle times half the height
           equals the area.
                         
          A girl in the back row raises her hand.
                         
                          DARLA
           Yes, Mia?

           Lucy's asleep again.
                         
          Darla puts down the chalk and comes up the aisle to where a
          slight, fair-skinned girl in a thrift shop dress sleeps head
          down on her desk. The girl from the opening scene. LUCY
          SHERIDAN. Darla stands over her with obvious concern. Puts
          a finger to her lips to quiet the giggles.
                         
                          DARLA
           Let her sleep.
                         
          She draws the shade. It drops a shadowbox on the sleeping
          girl.

          INT. COUNSELING ROOM, DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SERVICES, LOS
          ANGELES - DAY
                         
          A former gang member sitting with his wife and troubled eight-
          year-old son. The MARTINEZ FAMILY. A family in crisis.
          Sitting opposite is an LA County social worker. Twenties.
          Attractive but overworked. EMILY.
                         
                          GANG MEMBER
           He would just go off, you know, start
           tearin' the place down. You didn't even
           know why he was doin' it half the time,
           you just got out of his way...
                         
                          EMILY
           And what you learned from your father now
           Diego's learning from you...?
                         
          It's painful for him to hear that. He loves his son, quit
          the streets for him. Overcome by emotion, he nods yes.
                         
                          EMILY
           That really upsets you, doesn't it?
                         
          He wipes his eyes on his tattooed arm.
                         
                          GANG MEMBER
           Yeah. Cuz I mean I don't want him to be
           like me.
                         
          The boy looks at his father, has never seen him cry before.
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
                         
          Outside the conference room, Emily musses the boy's hair.
                         
                          EMILY
           A whole week without skipping school? Is
           that true?
                         
          He smiles, nods. A glimpse of the boy he might have been.
                         
                          EMILY
           That's the last time I make a bet with
           you.
           (to his parents)
           See you guys next week.
                         
          The Martinez family heads down the hall, Diego lagging
          behind. Emily watches with guarded optimism, knowing their
          chances. Then turns to the NEXT FAMILY, welcoming the
                         BELEAGUERED MOTHER:
           3.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           You cut your hair. It looks great.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY
                         
          The hurried opening and closing of files reveals PHOTOS of
          abused children. Bruises. Cuts. Broken bones. Emily
          trying to locate a single case amid the stacks and clutter on
          her desk. An angry mother SCREAMING at her on the phone:
                         
                          EMILY
           No one is trying to steal your child,
           they found bruises and cigarette burns --
           Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report --
           well, if you feel you need legal
           representation that's perfectly within
           your rights...
                         
          A flurry of obscenities followed by a dial tone. Emily puts
          the phone down. Sighs wearily.
                         
           WAYNE (O.S.)
           One less Christmas card for Emily.
                         
          Her supervisor WAYNE, forties, gay, leaning in the doorway.
                         
                          WAYNE
           How many active cases you have?
                         
                          EMILY
           Thirty-eight.
                         
          He drops another file on her desk.
                         
                          EMILY
           No, absolutely not, look at this, Wayne,
           look, I'm buried --
                         
                          WAYNE
           Sorry, Em, we all are.
                         
          He walks off. Emily shoves the new file onto the shelf above
          her desk. Looks at it guiltily. Takes it down again.
          Handwritten on the front: SHERIDAN, LUCY.
                         
          She opens it. A school portrait of ten-year-old Lucy clipped
          to the preliminary report. The sad face draws Emily in.
                         
          EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
                         
          An old VOLVO WAGON skirts rush hour traffic on Wilshire.
          Faded red paint. Ski rack on the roof. An ancient
          bumpersticker says Educate.
           4.
                         
                         
          INT. VOLVO WAGON - DAY
                         
          IPod jacked into the car stereo playing hip alternative
          MUSIC, Emily leans on an elbow as she drives, not crazy about
          L.A. but at ease with herself.
                         
          EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily's red Volvo wagon turns in the drive of a single-person
          home she rents in a working-class neighborhood.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Cozy. Her haven. Light colors offset dark hardwood floors.
          Emily comes in, stack of files under her arm. Tired. Long
          day. Drops the files in a chair. Sprinkles some food in a
          fish tank. Referees through the glass.
                         
                          EMILY
           Don't fight. Hey, that's his.
                         
          Turns on the tv. World news. Violence. People suffering.
          Turns it off. Puts on some quiet music. Hits play on her
          answering machine as she flops down barefoot on the sofa with
          a magazine, peeling an orange, decompressing.
                         
           YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
           Hey, it's Suze, missed you at yoga the
           other day, give me a call.
                         
          BEEP.
                         
           YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE #2
           Hi, Em, Jackie, just checking in, hope
           you're good.
                         
          BEEP. A charming male voice:
                         
                          DOUG'S VOICE
           Exhausted, her career path questionable,
           her faith in mankind shaken, she resisted
           her tendency toward introspection and
           went to have a drink with her friend
           Doug.
                         
          BEEP. Emily gives a tired sigh. Faint smile under it.
                         
          INT. BAR - NIGHT
                         
          Noisy, trendy downtown bar. Professional type on a bar
          stool. Thirties. Handsome. DOUG. He laughs when he sees
          Emily.
           5.
                         
                         
                          DOUG
           I am so in your head.
                         
          She gives him a kiss. Sits down beside him.
                         
                          EMILY
           Be honest. The whole psychology thing,
           it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?
                         
                          DOUG
           Regrettably, yes.
                         
          They share a laugh. He gestures to the bartender for another
          beer.
                         
                          EMILY
           You know what freaks me out?
                         
                          DOUG
           That you have a four-year degree and make
           seventeen grand a year after taxes?
                         
                          EMILY
           I sit there talking to these families,
           you know, like I'm some expert. My
           family's a train wreck. I mean, I had
           this moment today where I realized I
           might be totally full of it.
                         
                          DOUG
           Everybody's full of it. In the end
           you're a number to call for people who
           don't have anyone else. There's no way
           that's bad.
                         
          Emily nods, appreciates that. Recognizes a girl going by in
          the crowd. A friend from school. Well-dressed. Career-
          oriented. The track Emily might be on if she weren't a
          social worker.
                         
                          EMILY
           Hey Becca...
                         
                          FRIEND
                          (HUGGING HER)
           Hey. So one of us is a major screwup, I
           can't remember if I was supposed to call
           you or the other way around...?
                         
                          EMILY
           No, it's me, it's just been a crazy
           couple weeks. You remember Doug.
           6.
                         
                         
                          FRIEND
                          (HANDSHAKE)
           Hi.
           (then to Emily)
           Listen, my ride's leaving, let's catch up
           soon, okay?
                         
          Emily nods okay. The girl departs. Emily's beer arrives.
          Doug hands it to her.
                         
                          DOUG
           So anyway, I've done some soul searching
           and I just want to say that if a full-on
           relationship feels like too much right
           now, I'd be willing to consider a purely
           physical one.
                         
          Emily, sipping her beer, smiles.
                         
                          DOUG
           Hey, you might actually enjoy yourself.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm sure I would, I just...
                         
          Hard to explain. Doug saves her the trouble.
                         
                          DOUG
           I know, I know, the job, you get home you
           don't have anything left.
                         
          Emily nods yeah, leans in closer, the friendly banter giving
          way to a moment of real sincerity.
                         
                          EMILY
           If it were anyone, it'd be you.
                         
          They exchange a look then Doug clinks his glass against hers.
          And as they drink together after a long day, more than
          friends, less than lovers...
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Emily in glasses, reading the Sheridan file on her bed. The
          preliminary report concerns her: "Socially withdrawn. Lack
          of appetite. Sleeping at school..."
                         
          Her gaze returns to Lucy's photo. Sadly, under her breath:
                         
                          EMILY
           What are they doing to you?
           7.
                         
                         
          EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A dark, rundown family home on a once-prosperous cul de sac.
          Emily pulls up. Gets out. Checks that she has the right
          address. Halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her
                         TRACKS -
                         
          A WOMAN'S FACE
                         
          staring at her through one of the lacy white curtains
          upstairs. Ghostly pale. Gone as soon as she sees it. Emily
          stands frozen for a moment. Walks on.
                         
          She reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly, the
          security chain snapping taut. A woman's voice growls at her
          from the darkness inside:
                         
                          WOMAN'S VOICE
           What?
                         
                          EMILY
           Emily Jennings. Child Services? We
           spoke on the phone...?
                         
          Peering through the crack is the pallid, bony face from the
          upstairs window. Lucy's mother. MARGARET SHERIDAN.
                         
                          MARGARET
           You said the seventeenth.
                         
                          EMILY
           Today is the seventeenth.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Is not.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm sorry, but it is.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Friday was the thirteenth.
                         
          Emily, rather amazed at the conversation she's having, takes
          a newspaper from her bag. Indicates the date.
                         
                          EMILY
           Friday was the fourteenth, that makes
           today the seventeenth. Monday the
           seventeenth. The date of our
           appointment.
                         
          The door closes in Emily's face. What the hell? Then we
          hear the chain unlock. It opens again.
           8.
                         
          And we get our first good look at Lucy's mother. Gaunt.
          Pale. Dark rings under her eyes. She steps aside, not
          welcoming Emily in, merely allowing her to enter.
                         
          INT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          It's dark, the curtains drawn. Margaret twitches one open in
          begrudging courtesy. The house is tidy but sad, steeped in a
          kind of puritanical gloom. Lucy peers down through the
          upstairs banister, anxious, unsure what's going on. Emily
          sees her, smiles.
                         
                          EMILY
           Come down, I'd like to meet you.
                         
          Lucy hesitates, sensing her mother's disapproval. Comes
          slowly down the stairs. Emily shakes her hand.
                         
                          EMILY
           My name's Emily. What's yours?
                         
                          LUCY
           Lucy.
                         
                          EMILY
           Pretty name. Pretty girl.
                         
          Lucy turns shyly away.
                         
                          EMILY
                          (TO MARGARET)
           Is there somewhere we can talk?
                         
          Margaret sighs and heads down the hall.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily, file in hand, trying to project professionalism in an
          arm chair that tilts to one side. Margaret and Lucy sitting
          opposite on the sofa.
                         
                          EMILY
           When do you expect your husband back?
                         
          Margaret shrugs.
                         
                          EMILY
           Because we've found it's more beneficial
           if the whole family participates.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Well he's not home so...
                         
          Shrugs again.
           9.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           Do you have any way of contacting him?
                         
                          MARGARET
           Not if I don't know where he is.
                         
          Just then we hear a POWER TOOL go on in the basement. Emily,
          sensing the lie, indicates the floor.
                         
                          EMILY
           Is that...?
                         
          Margaret averts her eyes.
                         
                          EMILY
           Would you ask him to join us?
                         
                          MARGARET
           He doesn't have anything to say.
                         
                          EMILY
           Would you ask him?
                         
          Margaret weighs Emily's resolve, gives Lucy a cautionary
          glance then exits. We hear her open a door and holler into
          the basement over the noise of the power tool.
                         
           MARGARET (O.S.)
           Edward! EDWARD!
                         
          The power tool stops.
                         
           MARGARET (O.S.)
           That lady's here. From the state. She
           wants to talk to you.
                         
          We hear an angry unintelligible reply.
                         
           MARGARET (O.S.)
           I already told her, she wants to anyway.
                         
          We hear the power tool get thrown aside. FOOTSTEPS pounding
          up the cellar stairs. Emily's and Lucy's faces reflect the
          same simple fear. Their eyes meet.
                         
                          EMILY
           It'll be okay.
                         
          Lucy not so sure. The FOOTSTEPS are upon them. EDWARD
          SHERIDAN makes his entrance. A menacing man with a gaunt
          face and dark deep-set eyes. Emily holds out her hand.
           10.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           Hi, I'm Emily --
                         
          Edward forgoes the handshake, his contempt obvious. Sits
          beside Lucy on the sofa. Margaret sits on the other side.
          Lucy tenses, trapped between them. Emily speaks with
          kindness and composure. Hostile encounters part of the job.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm here today because Lucy's school is
           concerned about changes they're seeing in
           her academic performance. The kinds of
           changes they're seeing are often
           associated with family problems.
                         
          Edward leans over and whispers something caustic in
          Margaret's ear.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Eddie says we don't have family problems.
                         
                          EMILY
           That's just it, many times a family won't
           even know they're having problems until
           it's too late. That's where we come in.
           We help families communicate and learn
           healthier ways of resolving conflict.
                         
          Edward whispers again in Margaret's ear.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Eddie says we don't need your help.
                         
                          EMILY
           Mr Sheridan, is there some reason you
           won't speak to me directly?
                         
          Edward just stares at her.
                         
                          EMILY
                          (TO MARGARET)
           Is there some reason why your husband
           won't speak to me directly?
                         
          Margaret nods, gives Edward a look as though for permission.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger.
                         
          Emily does well to hide her fear. Refusing to be
          intimidated, she engages Edward's stare. A battle of wills.
          But his gaze has a murderous intensity she can't match. She
          looks down, shuffling papers. Battle lost.
           11.
                         
                         
          INT. CHILD SERVICES - NIGHT
                         
          Emily follows Wayne along a row of cubicles after hours.
          He's dropping files on desks. The new cases never stop.
                         
                          WAYNE
           No laws against being weird, Em. Send it
           over to CMC, we'll do a follow-up in a
           month.
                         
                          EMILY
           I didn't say weird, I said scary. The
           guy sat there the entire time staring at
           me, the mother is like his emotional
           slave.
                         
          Wayne pauses in mock bewilderment.
                         
                          WAYNE
           Wait, did you just fly to New York and
           meet my parents?
                         
                          EMILY
           Wayne, this girl's in trouble. I can
           feel it.
                         
          Beneath Wayne's humor, a sober, hard-learned practicality.
                         
                          WAYNE
           Wanna know what I can feel? The lawsuit
           we're gonna get hit with if we violate
           her parents' rights without any evidence
           they've done something wrong.
                         
                          EMILY
           Every time I talk to you you sound more
           like a lawyer, you know that?
                         
                          WAYNE
           Yeah, well, maybe because every time I
           make an emotional decision I get called
           by one. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to
           let this one go.
                         
                          EMILY
           You put these files in front of me and
           you ask me to tell you what's going on.
           Well, I'm telling you, there's something
           going on and it's not something good.
           I've done my job, I've told you, what you
           do with it is yours.
                         
          She walks off. Wayne alone after hours with his conscience.
           12.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, CHILD SERVICES - DAY
                         
          The elevator doors open with a DING and Edward and Margaret
          Sheridan step out in their Sunday best. Benevolent faces.
          Lucy between them, ribbon in her hair, brand new dress,
          appearing coached as she eats an ice cream cone.
                         
          Emily, disgusted by the charade, trades looks with the
          parents as they go past.
                         
          INT. PRIVATE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
                         
          Gazing fondly at Lucy, Edward directs his comments at Wayne,
          who sits opposite the family with Emily.
                         
                          EDWARD
           They really are God's miracles. Day she
           was born was the happiest day of our
           lives. We're not perfect parents, we
           know that, but we figure if you let `em
           know how much you love `em a lot of the
           other stuff takes care of itself.
                         
          Wayne nods his agreement. Edward puts his arm around Lucy
          for effect. Her eyes go to Emily. A silent plea for help.
                         
                          EMILY
                          (HOSTILE)
           Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've
           suddenly acquired the power of speech,
           doesn't it concern you a little that
           Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's
           in three months?
                         
                          EDWARD
           Course it does, she's our daughter.
                         
          With a glance Wayne cautions Emily about her tone of voice.
                         
                          EMILY
           So you have no idea why she's falling
           asleep at school every day? Why she's
           not able to sleep at home?
                         
          Edward looks at Margaret, then Emily, affects bewilderment.
                         
                          EDWARD
           Bad dreams?
                         
          INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY
                         
          Emily and Wayne in private conversation. She's pissed off.
          The Sheridan family in the other room, preparing to leave.
           13.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           He's gonna be having bad dreams when he
           gets hit with child endangerment.
           (off Wayne's reluctance)
           Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's
           little girl routine?
                         
                          WAYNE
           So they're overcompensating a little.
                         
                          EMILY
           A little? Let me talk to her. Alone.
           She wants to talk.
                         
                          WAYNE
                          EM --
                         
                          EMILY
           Five minutes. Talk to them about how
           much they love kids.
                         
          She goes out the door.
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
                         
          Emily walks with Lucy, looking for a way in.
                         
                          EMILY
           I knew someone at school named Lucy, she
           was a writer. Do you ever write? I do
           sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm
           feeling.
                         
          Lucy doesn't take the bait. She stops for a drink at a water
          fountain. Emily bends for a sip after. Misfires. As she
          wipes her face, embarrassed:
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water
           up my nose. So much for establishing
           trust.
                         
          Lucy smiles, for the first time. It's the opening Emily was
          looking for. Maintaining that precious eye contact,
                         DEEPENING IT:
                         
                          EMILY
           What's happening to you? I can help.
           Let me help.
                         
          Lucy looks away, eyes brimming with tears.
           14.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           What is it, sweetheart?
                         
                          LUCY
           They hate me.
                         
          She lowers her head in shame, tears rolling down.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm sure they don't hate you.
                         
                          LUCY
           They do. I hear them. They go in the
           cellar and talk.
                         
                          EMILY
           What do they talk about?
                         
                          LUCY
           Sending me to hell.
                         
          Emily's mouth falls open.
                         
                          EMILY
           You've heard them say that?
                         
          Lucy nods. As Emily registers this in quiet horror...
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
                         
          A tape recorder is running. Emily and Wayne alone with Lucy.
          She's hesitant to speak, naturally distrustful.
                         
                          EMILY
           It's okay. You can tell him. He's on
           our side.
                         
                          WAYNE
           Did you hear your parents say they were
           going to hurt you?
                         
          Nobody sees what Lucy sees at this moment. Edward glaring in
          at her through the window. Lucy looks at Wayne, shakes her
          head. Wayne looks at Emily, case closed.
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
                         
          Emily watches in agony as the Sheridan family steps into the
          elevator. Parent on each side, Lucy gives her one last
          pleading look then the elevator doors close and she's gone.
           15.
                         
                         
          INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Emily and Wayne in the heat of an argument.
                         
                          EMILY
           She doesn't trust anybody. You think I
           made it up?
                         
                          WAYNE
           I think you'd do just about anything you
           had to do to help a child you thought was
           at risk. Here are the facts, Emily.
           They haven't laid a finger on her that we
           can tell. And we have no proof they
           intend to. Meanwhile on your desk right
           now are thirty-plus cases of actionable
           abuse. What about those?
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm not giving up on her, Wayne.
                         
                          WAYNE
           Yes, you are, you're leaving this alone.
                         
          A look that says he means it.
                         
                          EMILY
           I hope you can live with a dead child on
           your conscience.
                         
                          WAYNE
                          (HURT)
           That's a little unfair, don't you think?
           I care about these kids as much as you
           do, but we can't go around yanking them
           out of their homes on a hunch. Parents,
           even bad ones, have rights, that's how
           the laws of this great land are written.
                         
          Emily gives a resigned nod, backing away from him, from the
          job, all of it.
                         
                          EMILY
           So that's it? We let kids get killed
           until they rewrite the goddamn laws?
                         
          She exits before he can answer, doesn't want to hear it.
                         
          INT. DETECTIVE BARRON'S OFFICE, POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Detective MIKE BARRON. Veteran of the force. Man of quiet
          faith.
           16.
                         
          A well-built silver-haired family man who played fullback at
          Brigham Young. He's doing paperwork. Smiles warmly as Emily
          enters.
                         
                          BARRON
           Was just thinking about you, got a nice
           letter from Sandy Hutchinson...
                         
          She drops Lucy's file on his desk. Whatever Barron was going
          to say is no longer relevant. Soberly, after a pause:
                         
                          BARRON
           Well, it's sitting in front of me which
           means our good friend Wayne thinks it
           fails to meet the criteria for child
           endangerment and has told you in no
           uncertain terms to leave it alone...?
                         
                          EMILY
           Surprise, surprise.
                         
          She starts to open the file. Barron stops her.
                         
                          BARRON
           I can't, Emily. I'm sorry.
                         
                          EMILY
           Mike, I'm desperate here.
                         
          Tense beat. The need for privacy now apparent, Barron gets
          up and closes his door. Sits down at his desk again.
                         
                          BARRON
           You know how dear to my heart the work
           you do is, but the department doesn't pay
           me to stakeout potential child abusers.
           Last time almost cost me my job.
                         
                          EMILY
           This girl heard her parents say they're
           going to send her to hell.
                         
                          BARRON
           Sickening as that is, you're a part of
           the system that handles those situations,
           I'm not.
                         
                          EMILY
           The system is broken.
                         
                          BARRON
           Maybe you just need to let it work.
           17.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           What? Jesus, I feel like I'm talking to
           Wayne. You don't want to get involved,
           fine, but don't bullshit me, I'm running
           out of people I respect.
                         
                          BARRON
           Okay. No bullshit. Give me evidence of
           a crime, I'll be all over it. Till then
           there's nothing I can do.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          The blade of a circular saw SCREAMS through a pinewood board,
          spitting sawdust...
                         
          A ten-pound hammer CRUSHES the head of a nail, sinking it,
          CRUSHES another, CRUSHES another, the speed of the handiwork
          conveying its urgency...
                         
          INT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Lucy peering into the basement through an air vent in the
          floor, vertical bands of light on her face. Edward hammering
          down below. He steps aside and we see what he's making...
                         
          A HOMEMADE COFFIN
                         
          Sensing Lucy's stare, he glances up over his shoulder. And
          Lucy ducks out of sight, breath held.
                         
          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Children waiting for the bus after school. Talking,
          laughing. Lucy stands apart, tired and solemn. The bus
          pulls up to the curb. As she goes to get on:
                         
           EMILY (O.S.)
           Lucy.
                         
          She turns. Emily behind her.
                         
                          EMILY
           I just wanted you to know I haven't
           forgotten about you. I'm doing
           everything I can.
                         
          Lucy hugs her, clinging for a moment.
                         
                          LUCY
           If I disappear will you come look for me?
           18.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           You're not going to disappear.
                         
                          LUCY
           If I do?
                         
          Emily holds her gaze, seeing the fear. Backing away, Lucy
          indicates the bus.
                         
                          LUCY
           I have to go. They get mad when I miss
           the bus.
                         
          Lucy turns to go. Emily watches. Helpless.
                         
                          EMILY
           Lucy, wait...
                         
          Takes her cell phone from her bag. Puts her number on speed
          dial.
                         
                          EMILY
           If anything happens, call me, okay? Just
           press this. Don't let your parents know
           you have it.
                         
          Tucks the cell phone in Lucy's coat pocket.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm gonna get you out of there, I
           promise.
                         
          Lucy boards the bus. Waves to Emily from a back window as it
          drives away. Emily waves back, heart in her throat. Might
          be the last time she sees her alive.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          A sleepless night finds Emily slouched on her sofa, leaving a
                         MESSAGE:
                         
                          ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hey, this is Doug, here it comes -
                         
          BEEP.
                         
                          EMILY
           It's me, thought you might be up, um,
           anyway, call if you get this.
                         
          Hangs up. Clicks on the tv remote. Channel-surfs. World
          news. Cooking show. Home shopping network.
           19.
                         
          Hip-hop music video. Watches it for a moment. Gangster with
          a mic. Scantily-clad girls shaking their asses.
                         
          The phone RINGS. Emily mutes the tv, picks up.
                         
                          EMILY
           Too late, I met someone else...
                         
          A child's whisper.
                         
           LUCY (V.O.)
           Emily...?

           Lucy? Are you okay?
                         
           LUCY (V.O.)
           I'm scared...
                         
                          EMILY
           Why? Why are you scared, honey?
                         
           LUCY (V.O.)
           They're waiting to get me, I can hear
           them... I'm sorry...
                         
                          EMILY
           Why are you sorry?
                         
           LUCY (V.O.)
           I'm falling asleep...
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay, listen, I want you to go over and
           open the window. Can you do that?
           Lucy...?
                         
           LUCY (V.O.)
           (softly; drifting off)
           I'm sooorry...

          The cell phone lying on the bed at Lucy's fingertips.

          INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Emily drops the phone. Moment of panic. Then a decision.
          Throws a coat on over her bed clothes. Grabs the phone
          again, dials a number in desperation.
                         
                          EMILY
           Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I
           told you about, I think she's in trouble -
           - yeah, I know what you said, but --
           Mike, you're not listening --

          Emily fumbles with her keys. Gets the right one in the door.
          Opens it. Jumps in. Starts the engine. Peels off down the
          road.

          The cell phone turns itself off, plunging the room into total
          darkness.
                         
          In BLACK, we hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. Down the
          hall. Stopping at the door. The knob turning. The click of
          the latch. The door opening. A shaft of light. Edward and
          Margaret peering in with frenzied anticipation:
                         
          Lucy is asleep. The time has come.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          Emily red-lines the tachometer, doing ninety down the
          freeway.
                         
          INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Slowly, quietly, Edward descends the stairs with Lucy asleep
          in his arms. Margaret in front of him, moving in tandem,
          holding a roll of duct tape.
                         
          They reach the bottom. Margaret rushes ahead into the
          kitchen.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Edward carries Lucy toward the OLD GAS OVEN where Margaret
          waits, holding open the door.
           21.
                         
                         
          Delicately, cradling her head, Edward puts Lucy into the oven
          without waking her. But as he lifts the door, one of the
          metal hinges CREAKS.
                         
          Lucy jolts awake with a SCREAM. Kicks open the door before
          Edward can shut it. With animal terror she thrashes her way
          out onto the linoleum floor. Margaret throws a piece of duct
          tape over her mouth, silencing her screams as Edward wrestles
          her back into the oven. But she kicks open the door again
          and the frantic struggle continues as...
                         
          EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Emily's car lurches to a stop out front. As she jumps out,
          Barron's pickup arrives. He joins her, a reluctant
          accomplice.
                         
                          BARRON
           What are we doing here?
                         
                          EMILY
           Saving her life!
                         
          She goes up the walkway. Barron lagging a few steps behind,
          eyeing the darkened house.
                         
                          BARRON
           They're asleep.
                         
                          EMILY
           They're not asleep.
                         
          Emily hears something inside the house.
                         
                          EMILY
           Did you hear that?
                         
                          BARRON
           I didn't hear anything.
                         
          Emily, trusting her gut, starts pounding on the door.
                         
                          EMILY
           Leave her alone!
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Hearing Emily, Edward and Margaret intensify their efforts,
          jamming Lucy's legs inside the oven. The duct tape peels off
          her mouth in the struggle and before the oven door slams shut
          she belts out one last desperate SCREAM.
           22.
                         
                         
          EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Clearly audible outside, it makes Barron jump.
                         
                          EMILY
           Did you hear that?!
                         
          Barron pounds his big fist on the door.
                         
                          BARRON
           Police, open up!
                         
                          EMILY
           Break it down!
                         
          Barron rams his shoulder against the door, but it holds
          solid.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          We see Lucy's screaming face through the oven window as
          Margaret cranks the temperature dial as high as it will go.
                         
          INT. GAS OVEN - NIGHT
                         
          From inside we see Edward and Margaret peering in as Lucy
          claws at the glass with her fingernails. Coughing as the gas
          fills the oven with a low hiss. We hear it ignite beneath
          her with a faint poof. The first shimmering waves of heat
          rising up, singeing her hair.
                         
          EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Emily, hysterical, knowing they're too late:
                         
                          EMILY
           BREAK IT DOWN!
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The front door comes crashing down, kicked off its hinges by
          Barron. Emily and he race in.
                         
                          EMILY
           LUCY?!
                         
          They take off toward the kitchen at the end of the hall.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Emily and Barron rush in. Emily sees Lucy trapped inside the
          oven. The sleeve of her pajamas catching fire.
           23.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh my God...
                         
          Edward tries to fend Barron off. It's a mistake. Barron
          unleashes a devastating blow that sends him recoiling into
          the fridge so hard the back of his head leaves a visible dent
          in the door.
                         
          Emily shoves Margaret aside and throws open the oven. Pulls
          Lucy out onto the kitchen floor, swatting out her burning
          pajamas with a dish towel.
                         
          Margaret grabs a steak knife and rushes at Emily, but Barron
          has her covered. Backhands Margaret so hard it spins her
          around fully before dropping her to the floor.
                         
                          BARRON
           The hell's the matter with you people?!
                         
          Pajamas scorched, wild with terror, Lucy cries in great
          heaving sobs in Emily's arms. Reduced to tears herself,
          Emily keeps saying the same thing over and over.
                         
                          EMILY
           I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha...
                         
          Shielding her from the sight of her parents: Margaret
          sprawled on the linoleum weeping. Edward slouched against
          the fridge, blood pouring down his shirt, his broken jaw
          hanging open like a man thinking wow.
                         
          INT. COUNTY COURTROOM - DAY
                         
          Edward and Margaret holding hands at the defendant's table,
          remorseless and defiant in their Sunday best. Among the many
          spectators we find Emily and Mike Barron. The STATE
          PROSECUTOR and PUBLIC DEFENDER addressing the JUDGE.
                         
                          STATE PROSECUTOR
           Prosecution asks that you disallow an
           insanity defense. This was an act
           committed with premeditation, malice
                          AFORETHOUGHT -
                         
                          PUBLIC DEFENDER
           Your honor, the egregiousness of the
           crime makes the competency question all
           the more relevant.
                         
                          JUDGE
           Yes. I hereby order the defendants
           undergo psychiatric evaluation to
           determine their mental fitness for trial.
           24.
                         
                         
          Emily rolls her eyes at Barron, some justice system.
                         
          EXT. COURTHOUSE PARKING LOT - DAY
                         
          Barron walks Emily to her car. She's outraged.
                         
                          EMILY
           Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing
           your kid, Freudian dream analysis.
                         
                          BARRON
           Well, you're gonna hate me for saying
           this, but my money's on crazy.
                         
                          EMILY
           Did they or did they not know what they
           were doing? That's the legal standard.
           They knew, they knew damn well!
                         
                          BARRON
           It's not that simple sometimes.
                         
                          EMILY
           (stops on a dime)
           Meaning what exactly?
                         
          Barron hesitates. He's crossing the line by telling her
          this.
                         
                          BARRON
           When we brought them in that night they
           told Captain Lister... They think she's
           evil, some kind of demon spirit, minion
           of the devil or something.
                         
                          EMILY
                          (LAUGHS)
           Oh, that's great - what is this, late-
           night cable?
                         
                          BARRON
           No, but that might be the world they're
           living in.
                         
          INT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Lucy in a hospital bed, dressings on her hand. Emily's
          friend Doug sitting bedside. Child psychologist.
                         
                          DOUG
           -- and what's the most important thing we
           talked about that you have to remember?
           25.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           It's not my fault what happened.
                         
                          DOUG
           That's right and you know what? It's
           not.
                         
          Lucy nods, not entirely convinced. Doug gives her a pat,
          crosses to the exit. At the door he runs into Emily. Shakes
          his head, awed at what she did.
                         
                          DOUG
           That is some seriously proactive social
           work happenin' there. You all right?
                         
                          EMILY
           Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing?
                         
                          DOUG
           Typical reaction, blames herself. We'll
           get there. I'm gonna put her in a group
           setting, see if I can get her to open up.
                         
                          EMILY
           Group therapy for kids, what's that say
           about the world?
                         
          He nods - no kidding, heads off. Emily comes over and sits
          on Lucy's bed. Strokes her hair.
                         
                          EMILY
           Good news. You get to leave here
           tomorrow.
                         
                          LUCY
           Doug said I might have to go to a state
           home.
                         
                          EMILY
           Only for a few days, till we find a
           better place.
                         
                          LUCY
           Why can't I live with you?
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh, sweetheart. That would never be
           allowed.
                         
                          LUCY
           Why?
           26.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           It's complicated, there's a whole
           process, I'm not even a foster parent...
                         
          Lucy gives a sad nod. Emily touches her arm.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm sorry.
                         
          EXT. STATE CHILDREN'S HOME - DAY
                         
          No frills, purely functional housing. Emily comes up the
          steps with Lucy and knocks. The COORDINATOR answers. A kind
          but beleagured-looking woman of fifty, who is surprised to
          see them.
                         
                          COORDINATOR
           They were supposed to call you. We don't
           have any rooms.
                         
                          EMILY
           Nothing?
                         
                          COORDINATOR
           There was a mixup with the dates. Sorry.
                         
          Emily rolls her eyes. Lucy standing there holding a
          suitcase.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Through the windshield Lucy watches Emily on a pay phone
          outside a convenience store. Her back is to us but you can
          see she's arguing with someone, scratching addresses off a
          typed list with a ballpoint.
                         
           TIME CUT TO:
                         
          Emily gets in and starts the car, putting on a smile.
                         
                          EMILY
           Hey, are you hungry? Let's get some
           lunch. What kind of food do you like?
                         
                          LUCY
           There's nowhere for me to go is there?
                         
          Heartbreaking. Emily can't lie. She turns off the engine
          and leans back with a sigh. Lucy's silence is a plea for
          rescue.
           27.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           I can't, Lucy, it wouldn't work, I live
           in this tiny house, I... I'm sorry, I'm
           not mom material...
                         
                          LUCY
           You don't have to be my mom. Just my
           friend.
                         
          A ten-year-old girl stranded at a convenience store, suitcase
          in her lap. Emily stares out the windshield, wrestling with
          her conscience.
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
                         
          At a round table, Emily addresses the CHILD WELFARE PANEL,
          six grave-faced administrators. Wayne is here, offering
          support.
                         
                          EMILY
           I know what it feels like to be that age
           and be unwanted. It's terrifying. She
           needs to be with someone she trusts; she
           trusts me. So much of our time is spent
           negotiating red tape, I think if we just
           look at the situation - this one
           situation, this one child - it's clear
           what's best for her.
                         
          The head of the panel is a bloated bureaucrat in a polka dot
          blouse (NANCY).
                         
                          NANCY
           This is highly irregular and I'll tell
           you right now it makes me very
           uncomfortable. But since, Wayne, you've
           spoken so persuasively on Miss Jennings's
           behalf...
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
                         
          Emily comes out and nods yes to Lucy who waits with a
          guardian. As they hug:
                         
           NANCY (V.O.)
           ...I'm going to go against my better
           judgement and approve this petition for
           temporary custody.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily walks Lucy through the house, showing her around,
          tidying things self-consciously.
           28.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           I like to think of it as a glass-half-
           full situation. Kitchen. Bathroom.
           Fish. And here, is your room...
                         
          INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          They stop in the doorway. A small office in which Emily has
          made space for a bureau and a bed. Professional books and
          backup case files pushed aside on a shelf.
                         
                          EMILY
           Be okay?
                         
          Lucy nods yes.
                         
                          LUCY
           Where's your family?
                         
                          EMILY
           My family... well, I've met my dad twice
           and my mom's not a part of my life
           anymore.
                         
                          LUCY
           Why?
                         
                          EMILY
           (choosing her words)
           Sometimes people have kids and then
           decide they don't want to be parents.
                         
          Beneath the measured tone Emily's pain is revealed, raw and
          untouchable, her entire life a rebellion against it. She
          opens Lucy's suitcase on the bed. Pauses, remembering
          something.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm glad you're here.
                         
          Lucy comes over to help unpack the clothes.
                         
           TIME CUT TO:
                         
          Lucy in bed, sipping a cup of tea as Emily brushes her hair.
                         
                          LUCY
           What's this?
                         
                          EMILY
           Chamomile, when I get stressed out it
           helps me sleep.
           29.
                         
                         
          Lucy nods that it's good. Emily brushes her hair. A natural
          bond between them.
                         
                          EMILY
           None of this ever should have happened,
           if I could make it go away I would.
                         
                          LUCY
           You did.
                         
          Nice moment for Emily. A rare triumph. She tucks Lucy in.
          Turns off the bedside light.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm right down the hall if you need me.
                         
          Lucy settles. Emily pauses at the door, looks back at the
          lost child she's taken in, then closes the door halfway.
                         
          EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Dark, abandoned. Emily's Volvo pulls up.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY
                         
          She eyes the house. It haunts her, the memory of what
          happened.
                         
          A SUDDEN KNOCK on the window makes her jump out of her seat.
          The guy there gestures a friendly sorry, didn't mean to scare
          you. White shirt and tie. A COURT CLERK.
                         
          EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily signs a form as he unlocks the door, letting her in.
                         
                          EMILY
           I have to grab some of her things, might
           take me a minute.
                         
                          COURT CLERK
           I trust ya, Em, make sure you lock it on
           the way out.
                         
          INT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily closes the door, glances around the dark interior.
          Through a window she sees the Court Clerk drive off. She's
          alone. It's quiet, eerily still.
                         
          She goes up the stairway. Slows, noticing something on the
                         WALL -
           30.
                         
                         
          A FAINT SQUARE where a picture once was hung, the wallpaper a
          half tone darker underneath. More SQUARES farther up. A few
          nails still sticking out.
                         
          INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM, SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Tattered lace curtains sway in a draft beside a bed with a
          moth-eaten coverlet. Emily packs Lucy's spare clothes into a
          dufflebag. Zips it and walks out.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Exiting Lucy's room, she notes the door to Edward and
          Margaret's bedroom, at the far end of the hall, is slightly
          AJAR. Succumbs to a natural curiosity.
                         
          INT. EDWARD AND MARGARET'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          The door pushes open, Emily peering in. A sad little master
          bedroom with old floral printed wallpaper and water stains on
          the ceiling.
                         
          She explores the room, inspecting various personal items -
          aftershave, glasses, hair brush - looking for clues to their
          madness.
                         
          An ALARM CLOCK with a cracked crystal face. She picks it up
          and it GOES OFF in her hand. Gives her a scare. She puts it
          down. Sees something out the bedroom window. Steps closer.
          Parts the curtains.
                         
          In the backyard, by the garden shed, a long rectangular hole
          has been dug. A SHALLOW GRAVE filling with leaves. Edward's
          handiwork. Emily's seen enough, heads for the door.
                         
          But slows, noticing something odd as she comes back around
          the bed -
                         
          A LONG DEEP SCRATCH
                         
          in the wooden floor, hidden under a long runner rug. Emily
          peels back the rug and finds -
                         
          HUNDREDS OF LONG DEEP SCRATCHES
                         
          in the floorboards leading toward the door. Something - the
          old oak bureau perhaps? - has been dragged repeatedly across
          the room.
                         
          Emily comes over and looks behind the door and sees, on the
          back of it, something even more bizarre -
                         
          TWO MASSIVE DEADBOLTS
           31.
                         
                         
          screwed hastily, crookedly, into the wood. She closes the
          door. Slides-to the big heavy bolts -
                         
          CLUNK.
                         
          CLUNK.
                         
          Pauses. Looks again at the bureau. Slides it in front of
          the door, a wheelless caster bracket leaving another long
          scratch in the hardwood. And it's clear at this point what
          the deadbolts and bureau add up to -
                         
                         A BARRICADE
                         
          Emily stares at it. Looks over at Edward and Margaret's bed,
          imagining them here behind this door. Slides the bureau
          aside. Opens the deadbolts. And as the door swings open she
          is looking straight down the hall at
                         
                         LUCY'S BEDROOM
                         
          Emily stares, bewildered.
                         
          INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY
                         
          ABUSED CHILDREN aged eight to thirteen sit in a circle of
          folding chairs. Lucy among them. Diego. Doug facilitating.
                         
                          DOUG
           Sometimes when our parents aren't getting
           along it's better if they don't see each
           other for a while, that's what a
           `restraining order' does...
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GROUP THERAPY - DAY
                         
          Emily looks in, waiting with other parents. Lucy sees her in
          the window and sneaks her a little wave. Emily smiles and
          holds up a hand that says, hi, hon. It's clear from these
          gestures how close they've gotten.
                         
           TIME CUT TO:
                         
          Emily and Doug walk together after session. Lucy talking to
          other kids her age by the elevator.
                         
                          DOUG
           She's starting to come out of her shell.
           It's good, I just wish I thought it was
           me making the difference.
                         
          Emily accepts the compliment.
           32.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           I went by the house. I think her mom and
           dad were barricading themselves in their
           room at night. How sick is that?
                         
                          DOUG
           Hatred and fear are part of the same
           pathology - oh, but I forgot, you don't
           think they're crazy.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm coming around.
                         
          As they part ways...
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Emily pulls up in front of Lucy's school. Big moment for
          Lucy. New clothes. New haircut. New life.
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay?
                         
          Lucy nods, apprehensive, but she's ready to face it. Emily
          hugs her.
                         
                          EMILY
           This is your new beginning.
                         
          Lucy gets out. Pauses on the sidewalk.
                         
                          LUCY
           I love you, Emily.
                         
          Emily, touched, smiles.
                         
                          EMILY
           I love you, too.
                         
          Lucy goes up the walk. Emily watches her safely into the
          building.
                         
          INT. CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Emily draws grim looks as she crosses the common area. A
          pall hanging over the entire department. The first person
          she walks past says:
                         
                          COWORKER
           Wayne's looking for you.
                         
          The second person:
           33.
                         
                         
                          COWORKER #2
           Wayne wants to --
                         
                          EMILY
           Got it.
                         
          She comes past Wayne's office. Empty. A coworker points
          over toward Emily's cubicle - he's there. She goes over.
          Wayne's inside, grave-faced, looking for a file. He finds it
          on the shelf. A photo of eight-year-old DIEGO clipped inside
          the cover. The boy we met earlier.
                         
                          EMILY
           What's up with Diego?
                         
          Wayne hesitates, wanting to spare her the bad news.
                         
                          WAYNE
           Why don't we talk in my office.
                         
                          EMILY
           Tell me what's going on.
                         
                          WAYNE
           We don't know why yet, but... he killed
           his mother and father last night.
                         
          Emily stands there, jaw on the floor.
                         
          EXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A police perimeter around a small house in a tough low-income
          neighborhood. Cops and crime scene investigators on the
          scene. Local news media broadcasting live. A couple of news
          choppers hovering overhead.
                         
          Emily pulls up, jumps out of her car. Mike Barron waves off
          the uniformed officer who moves to intercept her as she comes
          up the walkway to the house.
                         
                          EMILY
           What happened?
                         
                          BARRON
           Sure you want to see this?
                         
          With an uncertain nod she follows him inside.
                         
          INT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily and Mike Barron come along the uncarpeted hallway.
           34.
                         
                         
                          BARRON
           Gets a tire iron from the garage, comes
           back inside, locks all the doors and
           windows, kills them in their sleep...
                         
          The master bedroom. A bloodbath.
                         
                          BARRON
           Had to use dental records to identify the
           bodies.
                         
          Emily looks around, aghast.
                         
                          EMILY
           An eight-year-old did this? There's no
           way.
                         
                          BARRON
           I was there when they brought him in.
           Took three guys my size to subdue him.
           Kid was climbing the walls.
                         
          Barron turns to the window and - WHAM! - AN ATTACK DOG HITS
          THE GLASS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. Barron recoils with a
          yelp. Then, embarrassed, eyes the TRIO OF BATTLE-SCARRED PIT
          BULLS prowling the chainlink-fenced backyard.
                         
                          BARRON
           Just your average American family.
                         
          EXT. MARTINEZ HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily and Barron come down the steps.
                         
                          EMILY
           Where is he now?
                         
                          BARRON
           Juvie lockup. And, no, I'm not taking
           you to see him.
                         
                          EMILY
           You want to know what happened?
                         
                          BARRON
           I know what happened.
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike,
           please, I care about this kid.
           35.
                         
                         
          INT. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER - DAY
                         
          Diego Martinez sitting alone in a holding cell. Confused.
          Scared. He sees Emily approaching and immediately breaks
          down.
                         
                          EMILY
           Diego...
                         
          Emily tells the cop at the cell door:
                         
                          EMILY
           Let me in. He won't hurt me.
                         
          The cop looks at Mike Barron who nods it's okay. The cop
          opens the cell. Emily enters. Diego looks up at her,
          shuddering with emotion:
                         
                          DIEGO
           Are they dead?
                         
          Emily, gutted, nods yes. Diego buries his face in Emily's
          stomach and sobs.
                         
                          EMILY
           What happened? Tell me what happened.
                         
                          DIEGO
                          (SOBBING)
           I killed my mum and dad...
                         
          Emily, devastated, trades looks with Barron through the bars.
                         
          EXT. VENICE PIER - DAY
                         
          Doug tenderly consoles Emily. Has his arms around her.
          They're leaning against the railing, wind on their faces.
                         
                          DOUG
           Every family you sit down with every day
           of every week is a family in crisis.
           Those are your odds. That's the job you
           do. Trying to beat them.
                         
          Wipes away her tears. The hair from her face.
                         
                          DOUG
           You're one person, Em. You can't save
           the world.
                          (THEN)
           I know somebody you did save.
           36.
                         
                         
          Lucy on the beach below, walking barefoot at water's edge,
          hem of her dress in her hands. Emily watches her and,
          finding solace in it, leans into Doug's embrace and closes
          her eyes.
                         
          EXT. BEACH - DAY
                         
          The plaintive cries of seagulls overhead as Emily and Lucy
          walk along the surf at sundown, Emily barefoot now as well.
                         
                          LUCY
           You okay?
                         
          Emily nods, putting on a brave face to spare Lucy.
                         
                          EMILY
           It's just work. Don't worry.
                         
          Lucy nods okay. They walk on in silence for a moment.
                         
                          LUCY
           Why do you do it if it makes you sad?
                         
                          EMILY
           My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess
           maybe I want to believe families can
           work, so I can have my own someday, I
           don't know - does that make sense?
                         
          Lucy nods, takes her hand. They walk off up the beach
          together.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily, days later, dressed for work, halves an omelet with a
          spatula and slides the halves onto two plates.
                         
                          EMILY
           (calls to other room)
           Breakfast.
                         
          There's no answer. Emily goes to get her.
                         
          INT. LUCY'S ROOM - DAY
                         
          Stops in the doorway.
                         
                          EMILY
           Honey, breakfa--
                         
          Sees Lucy hide something under her pillow. Emily comes over,
          brow arched, playful.
           37.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           Come on, let me see...
                         
          Lucy guiltily eyes the floor. Emily lifts the pillow.
          Underneath it is a photograph.
                         
          EMILY, AS A YOUNG GIRL, WITH HER MOTHER.
                         
          She looks at Lucy, then at the filing cabinet from which it
          was taken. More surprised than upset.
                         
                          EMILY
           You went through my things?
                         
                          LUCY
           I'm sorry... I wanted to know what
           happened to you.
                         
          Disarming sincerity. Emily's gaze falls to the photo. Quiet
          moment. She sits down on the bed with it.
                         
                          LUCY
           Is that your mom?
                         
          Emily nods, lost in the image. It's a photo that captures
          her entire childhood. Emily and her mother sitting on the
          steps of a house, together but apart, like a lost child that
          sat down next to a pretty stranger who hasn't yet noticed
          her. Emily's ten-year-old face shows the quiet sadness of
          the disconnect. Reminds you of a child from her caseload.
                         
                          EMILY
           She used to just leave, she'd just...
                          (GESTURES `ADIOS')
           ...and I never knew when she was coming
           back, or if she was... I used to think it
           was my fault and I would try so hard when
           she got home to be good, do everything I
           could think of, so she'd think I was
           `special' and stay next time or take me
           with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd
           always go away again, that's how it was.
                         
          Emily fights her emotions and, practiced at the task, wins.
          Lucy sits beside her on the bed. Understands her deeply.
          Linked by their pasts.
                         
                          LUCY
           Where was your dad?
                         
                          EMILY
           Gone, he left before I was born. First
           time I met him I was like thirteen.
           38.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           What'd you say to him?
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh, I had all these things I was gonna
           say. Angry things I'd thought of and
           kind of memorized. And um.... And then I
           met him and I wasn't angry, I was just
           sad and I told him...
           (pauses, raw emotion)
           I said, I love you, even if you don't
           love me.
                         
          Emily smiles a pained smile and then buries the memory.
          Lucy, a portrait of contrition:
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you mad at me?
                         
                          EMILY
           No... No, I'm not mad at you.
           (puts her arm around her)
           But I need you not to do that again,
           okay? Go through my private things
           without asking?
                         
          Lucy nods okay. Emily moves on, with a loving touch:
                         
                          EMILY
           Omelet's getting cold. Better hurry.
                         
          Lucy exits. Emily eyes the photo a moment longer then stands
          and puts it away in the filing cabinet. She pauses, feeling
          exposed, and turns the little key to lock the drawers.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY
                         
          Emily stops at her cubicle, registering a surprise. Wayne
          handing her case files to three COWORKERS. Awkward moment
          for everyone.
                         
                          WAYNE
                          (SYMPATHETIC)
           I need another set of eyes to go over
           them, make sure we haven't missed
           anything else.
                         
                          EMILY
           You mean, to make sure I haven't missed
           anything else?
           39.
                         
                         
                          WAYNE
           It's just a legal thing. You'll have
           them back tomorrow.
                         
          They exit. She goes in and stares at the BARE SHELF above
          her desk. Her caseload gone. More than an insult.
          Everything she cares about.
                         
          A pink phone message on her keyboard. She picks it up: Mike
          Barron called. Important.
                         
          INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Newspaper headline: "INSANITY DEFENSE FOR GLENDALE COUPLE".
          MUGSHOTS of Edward and Margaret below. The morning edition
          folded on a table between Barron and Emily. They're drinking
          coffee.
                         
                          BARRON
           You watch, six months, their lawyer will
           hire some expert to say they're rehabbed
           and they'll sue for custody when they get
           out.
                         
                          EMILY
           She's not going back there, I'll take her
           out of state before I let them near her
           again.
                         
                          BARRON
           I didn't hear you say that.
                         
          Emily knows she's misspoken, but lets it stand.
                         
                          EMILY
           You wanted to talk about something?
                         
          Barron nods, sips his coffee, a bit uncomfortable.
                         
                          BARRON
           We pulled the Martinezes' phone records.
           They got a call that night before the
           murders.
                         
                          EMILY
           From who?
                         
                          BARRON
                          (SOBER PAUSE)
           Emily, the call came from your house.
                         
                          EMILY
           What...?
           40.
                         
                         
                          BARRON
           Look, I'm not accusing you of anything, I
           just need to know what was said.
                         
                          EMILY
           That's impossible. I might have called
           the week before...?
                         
                          BARRON
           I'm talking to you as a friend here, you
           know that, right?
                         
                          EMILY
           Did you not hear me? I'm telling you,
           Mike, as a friend, I did not call that
           family.
                         
                          BARRON
           Then who did? Go find the guy who broke
           in and just happened to dial the number
           of a kid whose case you handle.
                         
          Emily starts to say something, but stops as a confounding
          realization comes to her. And then to Barron.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Lucy sits on the sofa studying a photo of Diego. Emily sits
          beside her, her advocate. Barron opposite.
                         
                          LUCY
           He's in my group...
           (puts down photo)
           ...why, did something happen?
                         
          Emily nods yes. Barron, gently, mindful of Lucy's age:
                         
                          BARRON
           We're trying to figure out why. He got a
           call Thursday night from this number.
           I'm just wondering if he might have said
           anything...
                         
                          LUCY
           It wasn't me.
                         
                          BARRON
           You didn't call him?
                         
          Lucy shakes her head. Barron nods okay, then, speaking to
          her as a father might his own daughter:
           41.
                         
                         
                          BARRON
           Lucy, it's hard sometimes to tell the
           truth, but I know you will because you're
           a good little girl.
                         
                          LUCY
           I am telling the truth.
                         
                          EMILY
           My backup files are in your room.
           Diego's is in there. Maybe you got
           curious and went through some, dialed a
           number?
                         
                          LUCY
           It wasn't me, I swear.
                         
          Complete innocence. Emily nods okay, wanting to believe, but
          remembering the stolen photograph.
                         
                          BARRON
           The call was at 2 am, are you ever up
           that late?
                         
                          LUCY
           I didn't call him.
                         
                          BARRON
           Are you ever up that late?
                         
                          EMILY
           Mike, she said no. Maybe someone made a
           mistake.
                         
          Barron reads Emily's posture and disengages, stands to go.
                         
                          BARRON
           Yeah, maybe so. Night, Lucy.
                         
          INT. FRONT DOOR, EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Exiting, Barron tells Emily as gently as possible:
                         
                          BARRON
           She's lying.
                         
          And goes down the steps. Emily closes the door. Turns
          around and there's Lucy. Uncomfortably close.
                         
                          LUCY
           Do you believe me?
           42.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           I believe you.
                         
          Lucy hugs her and Emily hugs her back, but she's still
          thinking about what Barron said.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY
                         
          A PHOTO of Emily and Diego tacked to the corkboard panel
          beside her desk. Emily sits contemplating it. Her gaze goes
          from the photo to the BARE SHELF above her desk. Her
          caseload is still missing. This is bullshit.
                         
          INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Emily walks in, power pose.
                         
                          EMILY
           Give me back my cases or fire me. Right
           now.
                         
          Wayne, caught unprepared, eating a doughnut.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Caseload restored, Emily is multi-tasking, opening mail,
          sorting backlogged paperwork, talking on the phone:
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't care if it's a hairline fracture,
           he broke her arm, I don't want him back
           in that house. He what? He found
           Christ? When? That recently? Uh huh.
           Well he should have found Him sooner.
                         
          Hangs up. Doug leans in the doorway, drops a manila envelope
          in her in-box. And a computer printout.
                         
                          EMILY
           What's up?
                         
                          DOUG
           Copy of the Sheridans' psych evals for
           the file. And the cognitive profile Lucy
           did for me the other day.
                         
                          EMILY
           (re: Lucy's profile)
           How's it look?
                         
                          DOUG WINTERS
           Normal.
           43.
                         
                         
          But his tone suggests otherwise.
                         
                          EMILY
           Do I have to beg or are you gonna tell me
           what's going on?
                         
                          DOUG
           You have to beg.
                          (SAME BREATH)
           Coming from an environment like that,
           testing this normal is a bit abnormal, if
           that makes any sense.
                         
                          EMILY
           She's `abnormally normal'?
                         
                          DOUG
           I think she faked it, gave the answers
           she thought she should.
                         
                          EMILY
           Why would she do that?
                         
                          DOUG
                          (SHRUGS)
           She's ashamed of who she is. Ashamed of
           how she feels. Afraid nobody would want
           her if they saw the real her.
           (off Emily's reaction)
           It's no big deal, it just means I might
           have to push her a little.
                         
                          EMILY
           No, I know, I just... The Martinezes' got
           a call Thursday night. From my house.
                         
                          DOUG
           Did you ask her about it?
                         
                          EMILY
           She said she didn't. Mike thinks she's
           lying.
                         
                          DOUG
           What do you think?
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't know what to think.
                         
                          DOUG
           Hmm. Bring her in after work, I'll do a
           one-on-one. I wanted to talk to her
           about this anyway.
           44.
                         
                         
          He departs. Emily, alone in her cubicle, scans the test
          results with growing concern.

          Diego eating macaroni and cheese from a jailhouse tray.
          Emily sets a folded blanket on the bed as she sits down to
          talk to him.
                         
                          EMILY
           Got you an extra in case it gets cold.
                         
          Diego nods without looking up.
                         
                          EMILY
           I need to ask you something... about the
           night it happened... did you get a call,
           really late?
                         
          Diego stops eating. Stares at his food. Shakes his head no -
          warily, like someone might be listening.
                         
                          EMILY
           You didn't?
                         
          He shakes his head no. Still staring at his food.
                         
                          EMILY
           Diego, I know you did, they called from
           my house.
                         
          Diego puts down his fork, his fear obvious now, his breathing
          quick and shallow.
                         
                          EMILY
           What's the matter? What's scaring you?
                         
          He looks at Emily, terrified, starts HYPERVENTILATING.
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh God...
                         
          Emily tries to calm the panicked boy as he gasps for air, a
          horrible WHEEZING sound in his throat.
                         
                          EMILY
           It's okay... slow breaths... you'll be
           okay...
           (yelling down hall)
           Can somebody help us down here?!
           45.
                         
                         
          INT. INFIRMARY, JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER - DAY
                         
          A little two-bed infirmary with unpainted cinder block walls.
          Diego in bed on an IV drip. Emily talking to a NURSE by the
          check-in desk.
                         
                          NURSE
           He asked to see you before you left.
                         
          Emily comes over to Diego's bed. He holds her gaze in
          silence, a secret he's afraid to tell. Emily speaks at a
          whisper, as if to make the truth less frightening:
                         
                          EMILY
           Who called you? Was it Lucy?
                         
          Diego's PULSE ACCELERATES on the EKG monitor. He gives a
          trembling nod.
                         
                          EMILY
           Did she say something to you? Something
           that scared you?
                         
          Diego replies in Spanish, barely discernible, his throat raw:
                         
                          DIEGO
           El dijo...
                         
                          EMILY
           `El' dijo? What do you mean, `He said'?
                         
          Diego looks at her, confused, terrified. His RACING PULSE a
          jagged green line above the bed.
                         
                          DIEGO
           Era un hombre.
                         
          A chill goes through Emily.
                         
                          EMILY
           It was a man?
                         
          Diego gives another trembling nod. Emily beside him, baffled
          and a bit scared.
                         
          INT. CHILD SERVICES - NIGHT
                         
          After hours, the office is empty, half lit and eerily still.
          Emily is photocopying at a work station, haunted by what
          Diego said, the harsh upward light accentuating her tense
          features.
           46.
                         
                         
          The CYCLICAL SQUEAKING NOISE we hear is Lucy, in Emily's
          cubicle in the b.g., turning herself in circles on the office
          chair. Something very creepy about the disappearance and
          reappearance of that pale watchful face.
                         
          Finished, Emily walks back to her cubicle, thrown by the
          sight of Lucy spinning in the chair, walking head-on into
          that eerie intermittent gaze.
                         
                          LUCY
           Do...
                          (TURNS)
           you...
                          (TURNS)
           like...
                          (TURNS)
           working...
                          (TURNS)
           here?
                         
          Emily, unnerved, enters the cubicle.
                         
                          EMILY
           Well, photocopying isn't much fun.
                         
          Lucy stops turning, stares at her, sensing something.
                         
                          EMILY
           What...?
                         
          Lucy just stares. Doug appears in the doorway.
                         
                          DOUG
           Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys.
                          (TO LUCY)
           Ready, kiddo?
                         
          Lucy nods and gets up from the chair.
                         
                          DOUG
           Go ahead down, I'll be right there.
                         
          Lucy heads down the hall to the conference room.
                         
                          DOUG
                          (TO EMILY)
           You all right?
                         
                          EMILY
           This is weird. Diego said it was Lucy
           that called, but he called her a he, he
           said it was a man.
           47.
                         
                         
          His face - what? Emily nods yes. Doug's brow arches then
          furrows. He turns and heads down the hall.
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Doug sits opposite Lucy at the table, keeps it easygoing
          despite what he's just been told.
                         
                          DOUG
           So how's school?
                         
                          LUCY
           Fine.
                         
                          DOUG
           Any of your classmates giving you a hard
           time?
                         
                          LUCY
           No, they've been nice.
                         
                          DOUG
           Sleeping okay?
                         
                          LUCY
           That's not really what you want to talk
           about, is it, Doug?
                         
          Awkward pause. Awkward smile.
                         
                          DOUG
           You got me.
                         
          Opens his file. Takes out her cognitive assessment profile.
          Lays it flat on the table.
                         
                          DOUG
           Question 16a, are you afraid of the dark?
           You answered `no'. Question 16b, are you
           afraid of being alone? `No'. 16c, are
           afraid of your parents? `No'. You
           answered `no' to everything in that
           section. I think some of those should
           have been yesses. Everybody is afraid of
           something. Working through our fears,
           conquering them, is how we get better.
           So I want you to tell me... What scares
           you?
                         
          Lucy steeples her fingers and rests her chin on top, regards
          Doug with a look of frank appraisal. It is the face of a
          child, but behind those eyes there is a keen intelligence.
           48.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           I'll tell you what scares me if you tell
           me what scares you.
                         
          Doug did not see this coming.
                         
                          DOUG
           Fair enough. When I was twelve I was
           climbing a tree and I accidentally put my
           hand through a giant hornets' nest. They
           didn't like it. I got stung over a
           hundred times. They had to rush me to
           the hospital. I've been afraid of
           hornets ever since. Don't climb many
           trees either.
                          (SMILES)
           Everybody has fears. Now, what scares
           you?
                         
                          LUCY
           Me.
                         
          Pause.
                         
                          DOUG
           You scare yourself?
                         
                          LUCY
           Sometimes.
                         
                          DOUG
           Why, what about yourself scares you?
                         
                          LUCY
           I have bad thoughts.
                         
                          DOUG
           About what?
                         
                          LUCY
           People.
                         
                          DOUG
           People in general or certain people?
                         
                          LUCY
           Certain people.
                         
                          DOUG
           Like who?
                         
                          LUCY
           You.
           49.
                         
                         
          Silence.
                         
                          DOUG
           You have bad thoughts about me?
                          (SHE NODS)
           Why?
                         
                          LUCY
                          (SHRUGS)
           I just do.
                         
                          DOUG
           Was there something I said or did that
           upset you?
                         
                          LUCY
           (shakes her head)
           It's just the way you are...
                         
                          DOUG
           How am I?
                         
                          LUCY
           Facile.
                         
                          DOUG
           Facile?
           (she nods yes)
           Do you even know what that means?
                         
                          LUCY
           Easily comprehended. Often lacking
           sincerity or depth. You're smug, too.
           Want me to tell you what that means?
                         
          Dead silence. Doug skewered by a ten-year-old. A boyish
          shyness emerges, a relic from his own youth.
                         
                          DOUG
           Well, if, um, if I seemed `smug' or
           `facile' I want to -
                         
                          LUCY
                          (GIRLISH LAUGH)
           Don't apologize.
                         
                          DOUG
           Why?
                         
                          LUCY
           You're a grown up, it's embarrassing.

                          LUCY(CONT'D)
           Should we talk about school now? My
           grades are getting a lot better.
                         
          Doug just stares at her.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Waiting until Lucy is out of earshot down the hall, Doug
          confers with Emily by the water cooler. He's sweating,
          shaken by the encounter.
                         
                          DOUG
           Talked to a lot of ten-year-olds, I don't
           think I've ever felt like that before...
                         
                          EMILY
           Like what?
                         
                          DOUG
           Threatened.
                          (THEN; BAFFLED)
           I know a specialist, I'll call him in the
           morning.
                         
                          EMILY
           What do I do with her in the meantime?
                         
          Doug pauses, no idea, smiles an eerie smile.
                         
                          DOUG
           Don't let her get in your head.
                         
          Exits. His paranoia feeding Emily's. In the hush she hears
          that faint CYCLICAL SQUEAKING. Looks across the darkened
          office to her cubicle where Lucy is turning circles in her
          chair again.
                         
          That face. That face. That face.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Tense dinner. Emily barely touching hers. Lucy, absently,
          but with an almost surgical precision, is CUTTING PEAS IN
          HALF ON HER PLATE AND EATING THEM ONE BY ONE OFF THE TIP OF
          THE KNIFE. Weird. She stops, self-conscious, looks at Emily
          across the table.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you mad at me?
                         
                          EMILY
           No. Just tired.
           51.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           Want me to brush your hair?
                         
                          EMILY
           That's okay.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you sure?
                         
                          EMILY
           Some other time.
                         
                          LUCY
                          (STANDS UP)
           It will make you feel better. I'll get
           the brush.
                         
                          EMILY
           I said no, thank you.
                         
          Lucy stares at Emily for a moment then sits again. And it's
          strange, her posture seems subtly different, stiffer, bonier,
          as if all her muscles have drawn taut under her clothes. In
          a voice at once innocent and menacing:
                         
                          LUCY
           Doug said something, didn't he?
                         
                          EMILY
           No. Doug? He says you're doing great.
                         
          Tense silence.
                         
                          LUCY
           What did he tell you?
                         
                          EMILY
           Nothing.
                         
          Lucy stares at her, seeing through the facade. Then, oddly
          bright, taking a bite of food:
                         
                          LUCY
           You're funny.
                         
          INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          EMILY SILHOUETTED in the doorway, keeping her distance as she
                         SAYS GOODNIGHT:
                         
                          EMILY
           Get some rest.
           52.
                         
                         
          She starts to close the door.
                         
                          LUCY
           You forgot to kiss me goodnight.
                         
          A tense pause then Emily walks over and kisses her on the
          forehead.
                         
                          EMILY
           Goodnight.
                         
          Lucy clutches her wrist as she turns to go.
                         
                          LUCY
           I love you.
                         
          Emily, trapped, forces a tender smile.
                         
                          EMILY
           I love you, too.
                         
          Lucy's EYES GLEAM in the darkness. She turns onto her side
          for sleep, but those eyes don't shut even after Emily has
          walked out and closed the door behind her.
                         
          INT. DOUG'S CONDO - NIGHT
                         
          Football highlights on a liquid plasma tv. Doug flipping
          through a DSM IV diagnostic manual. The phone RINGS. He
          picks up, distracted, scanning the DSM index.
                         
                          DOUG
           Hello?
                         
          A strange INTERMITTENT STATIC BUZZ on the line.
                         
                          DOUG
           Hello...?
                         
          BZZZZT. BZZZZT. BZZZZT. A telecommunications glitch.
                         
                          DOUG
           Try again, sorry.
                         
          He hangs up. Finds the chapter he's looking for. ANTI-
          SOCIAL PERSONALITY TYPE. But he hears it again now -
                         
          BZZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZZZT - louder, deeper - and realizes, in
          quiet terror, that it's coming from INSIDE HIS EAR.
           53.
                         
                         
          INT. DOUG'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Doug opens the medicine cabinet and grabs a Q-tip. Wiggles
          it around in his ear and when he takes it out there's a
                         
                         HORNET
                         
          sitting on the cottony tip, scissoring its wings.
                         
          Doug stares in disbelief. Mouth gaping.
                         
          He throws the Q-tip in the toilet. Hits the flush lever.
          Watches the hornet spiral away. Gone.
                         
          Stares at the empty bowl. Did I just imagine that?
                         
          Shaken, he turns to the sink. Wedges his head under the tap
          and runs water into his ear.
                         
          Straightens and looks at himself in the mirror, toweling his
          face, trying to impose rational thought on the situation.
          But as the water spills from his ear, down his neck, onto his
          shirt, it brings with it -
                         
          TWO MORE LIVE HORNETS, half drowned.
                         
          With a yelp Doug swipes them from his shirt. Crushes them
          underfoot. Terrified, but clinging to rational thought a
          moment longer, he turns his head sideways to the mirror,
          parts his hair, and sees -
                         
          ANOTHER HORNET crawl from the ear canal, followed by SIX OR
          SEVEN MORE!
                         
                          DOUG
           FUCK!
                         
          Rationality goes out the window. He flails at them with the
          towel. Swats them dead. Picks them up and drops them in the
          toilet. Studies the last one for a moment. Its little legs
          twitching. Drops it in. Flushes.
                         
          A false respite. And a brief one. Because as the FLUSHING
          NOISE FADES he can hear an ominous DEEP BUZZING SOUND RISING.
                         
          It's coming from behind him. He turns to have a look.
          Nothing there. Bare wall.
                         
          But it's strange: the BUZZING IS STILL BEHIND HIM.
                         
          With dawning horror Doug turns and checks his back in the
          mirror, sees
           54.
                         
                         
          HIS ENTIRE SHIRT BACK IS CRAWLING WITH HORNETS!
                         
          Whimpering like a child, he undoes the buttons of his shirt,
          taking it off as delicately as possible. Slipping his arms
          gently from the sleeves.
                         
          Holding it by the collar, he takes two quick steps and tosses
          it in the shower. Slams the glass door, seals the crack with
          towels. And watches the hornets fly around in the glass
          enclosure, BUZZING FURIOUSLY, bouncing off the glass.
                         
          But as he backpedals he realizes the FURIOUS BUZZING is too
          close, too loud and too deep, to be coming from the shower
          over there. A sharp pain in his head confirms it. He GROANS
          and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens
          inside.
                         
          The BUZZING in his right ear spreads to his left - LOUDER,
          ANGRIER, its sources multiplying. Disoriented, he stumbles
          backwards with an AGONIZING SCREAM. Catches sight of himself
          in the mirror, the terror of the moment on his face. This
          can't be happening.
                         
          And now the nightmare takes a devilish turn. Looking at
          himself in the mirror, he sees -
                         
          HORNETS START CRAWLING FROM HIS NOSE. FROM BETWEEN HIS LIPS.
          FROM UNDER HIS EYELIDS. THE BUZZING NOW UNBEARABLY LOUD. AN
          ENTIRE SWARM RAGING INSIDE HIS SKULL, FIGHTING ITS WAY OUT!
                         
          Doug grabs his head in both hands and starts shaking it,
          trying to shake away the madness inside. But the hornets
          keep coming, COUGHED UP IN CLUMPS as he gasps for air.
          They're all over him, stinging his tongue, his eyes.
                         
          He goes berserk and starts SMASHING HIS HEAD against the
          wall, the door, the edge of the sink, anything he can find,
          opening a deep gash in his forehead, smashing it harder and
          harder because the BUZZING WON'T STOP, cracking his skull,
          SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY, pitching his head violently forwards
          and backwards like some demon-possessed heavy metal fanatic.
                         
          It's a grotesque display that ends on a sickening note when,
          with one particularly violent head jerk, he snaps his own
          neck - CRACK!!! He sinks to the floor, head askew,
          astonished look on his face.
                         
          And there he sits, paralyzed, eyes locked on the tv in the
          living room where football highlights play in silence. Fully
          conscious as the hornets fight their way back into his ears,
          nose, and mouth - a pilgrimage back to the mind that bore
          them.
           55.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COUNSELING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Emily exits a counseling room. Says goodbye to a young
                         FAMILY -
                         
                          EMILY
           See you next week.
                         
          - and comes down the hall toward the common area. A coworker
          stands from an adjacent cubicle. DENISE.
                         
                          DENISE
           Seen Doug? He had an appointment with
           one of my kids this morning, never showed
           up.
                         
                          EMILY
           Did you try calling him?
                         
                          DENISE
           All I get is voicemail.
                         
          Emily dials Doug on a fax/phone by the Xerox machine. On the
                         FIRST RING:
                         
                          ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hey, this is Doug, here it comes -
                         
          BEEP. She hangs up. A dark thought sends her toward the
          exit, calling back to Denise -
                         
                          EMILY
           Cover my desk.
                         
          EXT. DOUG'S CONDO - DAY
                         
          Emily knocking on the door of his Marina Del Rey townhouse.
                         
                          EMILY
           Doug, it's me, it's Emily...
                         
          No answer.
                         
          She comes down the steps to his car, walks past it and then
          stops, noticing the window is open a crack. Slipping her
          hand inside, stretching, she extends one finger just far
          enough to push the button on the garage door remote clipped
          to the sunvisor.
                         
          Up the drive, the door starts to open.
           56.
                         
                         
          INT. DOUG'S CONDO - DAY
                         
          A door in the first-floor hallway opens. Emily steps in.
                         
                          EMILY
           Doug?
                         
          No answer. She comes up the stairs into the LIVING ROOM.
          The tv is still on. Muted. Calls up the next flight of
          stairs.
                         
                          EMILY
           Doug, you here?
                         
          No reply. She goes up the stairs and down the hall and
          checks the BEDROOM. Empty. The bed unmade. It's when she
          turns from the room to go back downstairs that she sees him:
                         
          SLOUCHED DEAD AGAINST THE BATHROOM WALL, GUT BLOATED BY
          DECOMPOSITION, FACE COVERED IN BLACKENED DAY-OLD BLOOD.
                         
                          EMILY
           NOOOOO!!!!!
                         
          INT. COUNTY CORONER - DAY
                         
          With stoic grief Emily walks down the cold, fluorescently-lit
          corridor, intercepts a CORONER as he exits the exam room.
                         
                          EMILY
           Dr Johannsen?
                         
          He looks at her; pale, bespectacled, a bit standoffish.
                         
                          EMILY
           You did the autopsy on Doug Winters?
                         
                          CORONER
           (trying to remember)
           Winters -- oh, right, Douglas.
                         
                          EMILY
           How did he die?
                         
                          CORONER
           Family?
                         
                          EMILY
           Friend.
           (preempting his reply)
           I know the rules -- please, he meant a
           lot to me.
           57.
                         
                         
          Her face the proof. He indicates his adjoining office. They
          go in.
                         
          INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          He takes the autopsy report from a filing cabinet. Reviews
          his findings.
                         
                          CORONER
           Compression fracture of the third and
           forth vertebrae. Severed his spinal
           cord. Actual cause of death was...
           suffocation.
                         
                          EMILY
           You're saying he did that to himself?
                         
                          CORONER
           It appears all his injuries were self-
           inflicted, yes.
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh come on. He looked like he'd been
           beaten to death! Don't tell me he was
           some - some suicidal...
                          (BREAKING DOWN)
           ...I knew him! He was my best friend!
                         
          She turns away crying.
                         
                          CORONER
           Miss, I would never presume to know your
           friend better than you. But the injuries
           suggest he was trying to hurt himself.
           Unfortunately, he succeeded. I am sorry.
                         
          Emily, composing herself, gives a quiet nod. She has no
          quarrel with this man.
                         
                          EMILY
           Have you ever seen this before, somebody
           dying like this?
                         
          The coroner files the report, world weary.
                         
                          CORONER
           Truly, I am shocked every day by the
           violence people do to themselves.
                         
          INT. CEMETERY - DAY
                         
          DOUGLAS J. WINTERS etched in granite. A final prayer read
          by a PRIEST as he is laid to rest.
           58.
                         
          A breeze ruffles the clothes of the MOURNERS. Blows hair
          across Emily's haunted face.
                         
          Lucy, at her side, sees her grief and reaches for her hand.
          Instinctively, Emily retracts it. Lucy registers the slight,
          the wider implications.
                         
          Emily watches the coffin descend. She weeps openly.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Emily, red-eyed, driving home, sees something in her
          peripheral vision that sends a chill through her.
                         
          Lucy, gazing quietly out the passenger-side window, is
          SWINGING HER LEGS in that contented way children do. A small
          but telling detail. Immediately HER LEGS STOP SWINGING,
          sensing Emily's stare. And with her head still turned away:
                         
                          LUCY
           You think it's my fault, don't you?
                         
          She turns to face Emily, who measures her words.
                         
                          EMILY
           It was an accident. It was nobody's
           fault.
                         
          Lucy holds her gaze. Then, as if to test her, reaches again
          for Emily's hand. Trapped in the lie, Emily has to let her.
          And as she drives on in that private hell, holding hands with
          Lucy...

                          EMILY
           He was scared. He came out of that room
           with her, Mike, and he was scared. He
           said she threatened him.
                         
                          BARRON
           Listen. You're still in shock. Let's
                          NOT --
                         
                          EMILY
           Diego said it was a man on the phone.
           You know who made that call. There was
           no one else in the house.
           (off his look)
           You think I don't know how crazy this
           sounds?!
           59.
                         
                         
                          BARRON
           Look, I don't know, all I'm saying is a
           kid in his state of mind maybe isn't the
           most reliable witness.
                         
                          EMILY
           Why is he in that state of mind? Why was
           Doug? Pull my phone records. See if she
           called him.
                         
                          BARRON
           Emily. I already did. There were no
           calls from your house.
                         
          Emily's argument collapses. She sits there for a moment,
          vexed, her intellect telling her one thing, her gut another.
          She gets up to go. Pauses at the door.
                         
                          EMILY
           Her mother and father, their bedroom door
           has these deadbolts on it, big ones, two
           of `em... Something came through that
           door and they didn't want it ever coming
           through there again.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY
                         
          Emily digs through her in-box, spilling things on the floor.
          Finds the manila envelope Doug gave her. Rips it open.
          Dumps the contents into her hand.
                         
          A VIDEO TAPE
                         
          Typed on the label: Sheridan, Marg. & Ed., Prelim. Psych
          Interviews.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          ON A TELEVISION - Margaret Sheridan sits facing the camera,
          responding to the questions of an unseen interviewer. Her
          haunted face and frank tone make the interview chilling.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           And by forcing your daughter into the
           oven, can you tell me, what did you think
           the outcome would be?
                         
                          MARGARET
           You mean what were we doing it for?
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Yes.
           60.
                         
                         
                          MARGARET
           To kill her.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Why?
                         
                          MARGARET
           God's will.
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
                         
          Pulling back, we see Emily alone in a dimmed conference room
          watching the tape.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           And why was it God's will that you should
           kill your daughter?
                         
          An eerie smile comes to Margaret's face.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Why is that funny, Margaret?
                         
                          MARGARET
           `Cause she's not my daughter.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           You're her mother...?
                         
                          MARGARET
           I bore her, but she's not mine.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Help me understand. If you and Edward
           are Lucy's biological parents, how can
           she not be yours?
                         
                          MARGARET
           `Cause she's not Of us.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Not Of you?
                         
          Margaret nods.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Who is she Of?
                         
                          MARGARET
           Not who, what.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           What is she Of?
           61.
                         
                         
                          MARGARET
           Stop acting like you don't know what I'm
           talking about.
                         
          Stares at him. Her eyes black and unblinking.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           You think your daughter is the devil?
                         
                          MARGARET
           Not him himself, Of him, working in his
           name, in his honor.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Evil incarnate?
                         
                          MARGARET
           I don't care what you call it.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           And why do you think that?
                         
                          MARGARET
           Not what I think it's what I know.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           How do you know this? Could you give me
           an example?
                         
          Margaret pauses. Seeming afraid for the first time. Some
          secrets perhaps best left untold.
                         
                          MARGARET
           She can make you see things. Visions.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Visions of what?
                         
                          MARGARET
           Hell. Damnation. Whatever you're afraid
           of.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           I see. Any other `special abilities'?
                         
                          MARGARET
           People die around her, is that a special
           ability?
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           She kills people?
           62.
                         
                         
                          MARGARET
           Not by her hand, they just die. I had
           two brothers, Brent and Travis...
                         
          Margaret's voice falters. Overcome by grief, she dissolves
          into tears. It's a side of her we've never seen. Human.
                         
                          MARGARET
           ...and I mean they was healthy boys,
           healthy as can be. Eddie, three sisters.
           Soon as she was born they started dying.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           You blame Lucy for their deaths?
                         
          Margaret nods yes, wiping her eyes. Embarrassed.
          Unaccustomed to crying in front of strangers.
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Why do you imagine you were spared?
                         
                          MARGARET
           I guess she couldn't get rid of us till
           she found somebody else. Now that she
           has, I don't imagine we're long for this
           world.
                         
          CLOSE UP ON MARGARET - face streaked with tears, her pain
          deep and undeniable.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          VIDEO OF EDWARD SHERIDAN in a violent rage. Pushing his
          chair back from the interview table, he stands, screaming
          through clenched teeth, his broken jaw wired shut:
                         
                          EDWARD
           THE HELL DID I JUST SAY?!
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Edward, please calm --
                         
                          EDWARD
           YOU AND YOUR GODDAMN QUESTIONS! YOU
           DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
                         
          A pair of orderlies rush in to restrain him. The CAMERA gets
          knocked ajar in the struggle. The tape ends as they take
          Edward screaming to the floor.
                         
                          EDWARD
           IT'S NOT CHILD KILLING IF SHE'S NOT A
           CHILD!
           63.
                         
                         
          And that's the interview. Emily stares at the BLANK BLUE
          SCREEN, transfixed, lowers her gaze to the table.
                         
          There's a PHOTO tucked inside the psychiatric file. Edward
          and Margaret in happier times - YOUNG BIBLE CAMP COUNSELORS
          in T-shirts and hiking boots on a path through sunlit forest.
          Sweet. Innocent. Emily's age. The year they met perhaps.
                         
          She holds it up to the newspaper mugshots for a before-and-
          after comparison. The transformation of their faces is
          shocking. Emily sits frozen by the realization: Edward and
          Margaret Sheridan. Not criminals. Victims.
                         
          INT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          An old brick orphanage turned psychiatric hospital. Emily's
          Volvo goes up the winding tree-lined drive.
                         
           CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)
           Unfortunately Mrs Sheridan suffered a
           rather severe psychotic episode last
           night...
                         
          INT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Emily and the CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST walk down a dark,
          institutional corridor.
                         
                          CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST
           ...Woke up screaming, absolutely
           convinced she was on fire. She wasn't,
           of course, they managed to sedate her.
           But it's curious, she displays all the
           symptoms of a burn patient. Except the
           burns themselves...
                         
          Margaret's door. Emily peers through a little square of
          reinforced glass. A padded cell. Margaret strapped to a
          bed. Writhing in pain. Laboring to breathe. Eyes swimming.
                         
                          CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST
           In no condition for visitors as you can
           see. If you'd like, I could let you see
           Mr Sheridan?
                         
          Emily hesitates, afraid of him.
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay.
                         
          She casts a departing glance through the window and shudders
          to see that Margaret's roaming eyes have locked on her in a
          hollow stare.
           64.
                         
                         
          INT. VISITATION ROOM, PSYCH HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Restrained in a straitjacket, Edward is brought in by two
          orderlies who seat him at a table opposite Emily and then
          exit. Jaw wired, everything he says is spoken through
          clenched teeth.
                         
                          EMILY
           I know I'm probably the last person you
           want to see right now, but you're...
                         
          His stare unnerves her. She stops and collects herself.
                         
                          EMILY
           You're the only one I can talk to.
           Lucy's been staying with me -
                         
                          EDWARD
           Who died?
                         
          Emily falls silent. Her voice cracks with emotion.
                         
                          EMILY
           A friend.
                         
          Edward nods yup. Regards her in silence. Emily speaks, or
          tries to, just to fill that awful void.
                         
                          EMILY
           I, ummm...
                         
                          EDWARD
           You're scared.
                         
          Emily, skewered again, nods yes.
                         
                          EDWARD
           You oughta be.
                         
          Dead silence. She meets his gaze. And there is eye contact,
          true understanding.
                         
                          EDWARD
           You judged us before you ever walked in
           that house. Sat there in our living room
           tellin' us about our problems, how to be
           better parents - certain of everything
           and dead wrong about all of it.

           Ask what you came to ask.
                         
          After a moment:
           65.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           What is she?
                         
          It's a question Edward has asked himself once or twice. He
          leans back in his chair and folds his arms with an almost
          casual air.
                         
                          EDWARD
           Can tell you what she's not. She not a
           daughter of mine. She's not a ten-year-
           old having trouble in school. She's not
           some innocent victim whose door you
           busted down and life you saved. And
           she's not going no place, lady, till
           she's good and done with you.
                         
                          EMILY
           Done with me how?
                         
                          EDWARD
           However she wants. You think it's an
           accident her ending up with you? She saw
           you coming a mile away.
                         
                          EMILY
           Why me? I don't have anything.
                         
                          EDWARD
           You have that you're good. Kindness.
           Decency. That's what she feeds on.
           Bleeds ya dry, moves onto the next. We
           were a big family, she went through us
           like a wrecking ball. And you know,
           every time something happened, every
           time, we had an excuse for why it wasn't
           her fault. Cuz it's easier to lie to
           yourself than think bad things about your
           baby girl. But finally we got to a point
           where me and Maggy looked at each other -
           (remembers so clearly)
           - where we looked at each other and we
           was out of lies, both of us. Most
           terrifying moment of our lives. And
           that's where you are now.
                         
          Emily silently registering this truth.
                         
                          EDWARD
           I'll tell you this. She sees everything.
           And what she doesn't see she just sort of
           senses it, like when you call a friend
           and they pick up before it rings?
                          (MORE)
           66.
                         
                          EDWARD(CONT'D)
           Only time you got the upper hand is when
           she's sleepin' but she almost never does.
           We checked on her every night for three
           months. Every twenty minutes, up and
           down those stairs. First time she slept
           was the night you kicked in my front
           door.
                         
          After a moment:
                         
                          EMILY
           What does she want?
                         
                          EDWARD
           To know... what your idea of hell is...
           and make you live there.
                         
          Emily sits in haunted silence. Edward's features soften.
                         
                          EDWARD
           I'm not a hateful man. I look at you and
           I wish I could tell you you're through
           the worst of it. That it's gonna work
           out for you in the end. I wish I could.
                         
                          EMILY
           What should I do?
                         
          A pitying smile reveals Edward's wired teeth.
                         
                          EDWARD
           How strong's your faith?
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, CHILD WELFARE - DAY
                         
          NANCY, the bloated director from the custody panel, walking
          briskly down a corridor. Emily calls to her from behind,
          approaching.
                         
                          EMILY
           Nancy...?
                         
                          NANCY
           Emily, I heard about Doug. I'm so sorry.
                         
                          EMILY
                          (NODS)
           Do you have a minute?
                         
          Nancy glances at her watch, nods okay, a minute.
                         
          INT. CHILD WELFARE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Emily and Nancy enter the lavish office.
           67.
                         
                         
                          NANCY
           How's it working out with the Sheridan
           girl?
                         
                          EMILY
           Actually, that's why I'm here. I
           appreciate what you did for me, Nancy, I
           really do, but I think it'd be best if
           she was placed in foster care.
                         
                          NANCY
           She is. You're it.
                         
                          EMILY
           I know, but it's not working out.
                         
                          NANCY
           Playing mommy isn't the laugh-a-minute
           you were hoping, huh?
                         
                          EMILY
           I suppose not.
                         
          Nancy nods, not entirely surprised.
                         
                          NANCY
           Sorry, you petitioned for custody, you
           got it. She's your responsibility.
                         
                          EMILY
           Until when?
                         
                          NANCY
           Till we find a suitable foster home.
                         
                          EMILY
           How long is that going to take?
                         
                          NANCY
           You're asking me questions you know the
           answer to. Three to six weeks. Surely
           you can manage that long.
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't want her anymore. I'm done.
           That's it.
                         
          Nancy grimaces. Scary lady.
                         
                          NANCY
           Now you look. I put my reputation, quite
           possibly my career, on the line for you.
           Don't embarrass me. You make this work.
           68.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           How do I make it work if it's not
           working?
                         
                          NANCY
           However! Find a way!
                         
          INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY
                         
          A CLERK stops in an aisle, hands Emily a DEADBOLT from a
          shelf.
                         
                          HARDWARE CLERK
           That what you're looking for?
                         
                          EMILY
                          (NODS)
           Thanks.
                         
          He walks off. Emily weighs the deadbolt in hand. Puts it
          down and picks up the next larger size. Grabs a second one
          just to be safe. A third for good measure.
                         
          INT. LUCY'S ROOM, EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          With urgency Emily removes all her backup files from the
          shelf in Lucy's room. Dropping them in banker's boxes.
          Stops on Diego's. Eyes his photo. Drops it in. Grabs the
          office phone, boxes it with the files.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily unplugs the phone in the kitchen. Unplugs the one by
          the sofa.
                         
          Opens the closet and tosses the phones inside with the
          banker's boxes she put there. Closes the door. Locks it.
          Hides the key.
                         
          Just then, a FLASHING RED LIGHT draws her gaze to the window -
                         
          A SCHOOL BUS
                         
          stopping at the end of the block. Emily crosses to the
          window, watching as
                         
                         LUCY
                         
          gets off and comes up the sidewalk toward the house. Sensing
          Emily's stare, she stops and meets it. Waves, testing the
          waters. Emily waves back but it's a hollow gesture. Lucy's
          smile fades, knowing this as she continues toward the house.
           69.
                         
                         
          In a sudden panic Emily goes into the kitchen, grabs one of
          the knives. Eyes the blade, forced to contemplate the
          unthinkable - its use as a weapon, self-defense.
                         
          She comes into the living room, holding it. Catches sight of
          herself in the mirror. A jarring image:
                         
          Sweet Emily Jennings with a butcher's knife in her hand.
                         
          The sound of LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS on the front steps breaks the
          spell.
                         
          Emily hides the knife behind the fish tank. No good, you can
          see it through the glass.
                         
          We hear LUCY'S KEY IN THE LOCK.
                         
          Emily grabs the knife. It's in her hand as the door CLICKS
          open, until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa
          pillow.
                         
          Lucy enters. Shy. Innocent. A ten-year-old home from
          school.
                         
                          LUCY
           Hi.
                         
          Emily returns a plastic smile.
                         
                          EMILY
           Hi.
                         
                          LUCY
           You weren't there so I took the bus.
                         
                          EMILY
           Sorry, work - lost track of time.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's okay, I know how busy you are.
                         
          Emily watches unnerved as Lucy crosses to the sofa, to the
          very pillow where she hid the butcher's knife, and sits down
          to untie her shoes. The point of the knife is almost
          touching her leg. If she moves at all, it will cut the skin.
                         
                          LUCY
           Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops
           right at the end of the street. So I can
           always get home, whether you're there or
           not.
           70.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           Lucky.
                         
          Lucy nods then pauses and looks at the pillow, or appears to,
          but she is actually looking at the end table.
                         
                          LUCY
           Where's the phone?
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh, it wasn't working...
                         
          Lucy nods oh. Finishes untying her shoes then gets up and
          walks into the kitchen, checks the wall, turns to Emily.
                         
                          LUCY
           Wow. That one, too.
                         
          Emily, caught in a lie, says nothing.
                         
                          LUCY
           Can I have a shower? We had gym today...
                         
          Emily nods. Lucy heads into the bathroom. Pauses at the
          door, back turned.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are they being nice to her?
                         
                          EMILY
           Who?
                         
                          LUCY
           My mother.
                         
          She turns for Emily's reaction.
                         
                          EMILY
           How - how would I know that?
                         
                          LUCY
           I thought you said you were going to see
           her.
                         
                          EMILY
           I never said that.
                         
          Lucy frowns. A bewilderment that seems genuine.
                         
                          LUCY
           Hm. I must have dreamt it.
                         
          Goes into the bathroom. Closes the door.
           71.
                         
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Ear pressed to the bathroom door, Emily listens to the
          RUNNING WATER: Lucy taking a shower.
                         
          She goes to the closet, unlocks it. Grabs one of the phones.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          It sounds like EMILY'S VOICE is coming from the fridge until
          we sweep past it to see her crouching by a phone jack in the
          corner. Whispering.
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find
           somewhere that will take her. Tonight.
           I don't want this girl in my house.
                         
          Emily unplugs the phone. And just then hears a SOFT BREATH
          behind her. Oh shit. Slowly turns.
                         
          LUCY IN A BATH ROBE BEHIND HER.
                         
          Hair dripping wet. A chilling stare. How much did she hear?
          Lucy walks out. We hear her bedroom door close.
                         
          Emily crouched in the corner, holding the phone, terrified at
          the thought of what's in store.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          THE HEAD OF A TURNING SCREW - Emily installing a DEADBOLT on
          her door in the middle of the night.
                         
          It's the third lock, the other two already in place. Hands
          trembling, she lines up the last screw. It slips from her
          fingers. ROLLS UNDER THE DOOR.
                         
          She cracks opens the door. Reaches to grab it and lets out a
          SHRIEK, recoiling -
                         
                         FEET
                         
          standing just outside her door.
                         
          LUCY, IN PAJAMAS, HOLDING THE SCREW
                         
          She hands it back to Emily, making no overt acknowledgement
          of it.
                         
                          LUCY
           Good night.
           72.
                         
                         
          She walks down the hallway to her bedroom.
                         
          As soon as Lucy's door closes, Emily closes hers and goes
          back to work, doublespeed. Winds that last screw into the
          wood and then slides-to the heavy bolts.
                         
          CLUNK. CLUNK. CLUNK.
                         
          Scooting backwards, she sits against the bed, wide-eyed with
          terror, screwdriver clutched in her fist like a stabbing
          weapon.
                         
          EXT. OLD STONE CHURCH - DAY
                         
          A bell TOLLS in a steeple.
                         
          Down below, Emily is going against the tide, walking up the
          steps past CHURCHGOERS who are coming down after morning
          mass. Halfway up, she runs into Mike Barron and his wife and
          son. It's awkward, more for her than him.
                         
                          BARRON
           Emily...?
                         
                          EMILY
           Mike.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH PARK - DAY
                         
          Sitting on a bench in a park that occupies the shadow of the
          old stone church, Emily and Mike talk privately. His wife
          pushing his young son on a playground swing.
                         
                          EMILY
           `No such thing as a bad kid, only bad
           parents.' I always believed that. It's
           a lie. Her parents aren't crazy.
                         
                          BARRON
           You wanna end up where they did keep
           talking like this.
           (off her look)
           I'm not judging you. You're grieving for
           Doug and you're still confused about what
           Diego did.
                         
                          EMILY
           Aren't you?
                         
                          BARRON
           Diego grew up in a bad home, he saw
           violence and he repeated it, that's the
           cycle, you know that better than anyone.
           73.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           Why did she lie about calling him?
                         
                          BARRON
           `Cause she's a liar, that doesn't mean
           she made him do it. Look, let me tell
           you what Lucy is. Lucy is a damaged
           child, a deceitful child, a manipulative
           child. But a damaged, deceitful,
           manipulative child is not a demon. Ask
           my brother-in-law, he's got a couple of
           `em.
                         
          Barron stands from the bench.
                         
                          EMILY
           Mike, you know I'm not crazy. Don't run
           away from something just because it
           scares you.
                         
          His concern edges toward sadness. He indicates the church.
                         
                          BARRON
           I stopped you on the steps. I think
           maybe you oughta go all the way in.
                         
          Walks off to rejoin his wife and son. Emily alone on a bench
          in the shadow of a church.
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GROUP THERAPY - DAY
                         
          The circle of abused children. Lucy among them, a happy
          participant. Nancy filling in for Doug.
                         
          It's EMILY'S POV - as she spies on Lucy through the window,
          second-guessing herself for a moment.
                         
          Session over, Nancy dismisses the group with a smile and
          theatrical applause.
                         
          Emily watches Lucy cross the room. At the coat rack, she
          whispers something to another girl. The veil of Lucy's hair
          partially obscures her profile, but through that veil Emily
          sees something chilling. For a moment, a moment so fleeting
          it might just be a trick of the eyes -
                         
          LUCY'S LIPS APPEAR THICKER, MORE MASCULINE, SPEAKING CAUSTIC
          WORDS THAT HOLD THE OTHER GIRL CAPTIVE.
                         
          Emily draws a sharp inward breath. Lucy, feeling Emily's
          stare now, turns to meet it. Her SWEET INNOCENT GIRL LIPS
          widening into a smile.
           74.
                         
                         
          But Emily knows what she saw. She throws open the door and
          rushes in.
                         
          INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY
                         
          Grabs Lucy by the arm and yanks her bodily from the room.
          This, to the amazement of Nancy, the other children -
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GROUP THERAPY - DAY
                         
          - and to the shock of the other PARENTS waiting outside.
          Nancy comes after her in a fury. Runs her down. Erupts.
                         
                          NANCY
           Who do you think you are barging in there
           like that?!
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't want her in group anymore, I
           don't want her around the other kids.
                         
                          NANCY
           Well that's not your decision, is it?!
                         
          Emily opens her mouth to reply, but Lucy beats her to the
          punch.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a
           lot of stress lately, but she's really
           nice to me and I hope I can stay with her
           a really long time.
                         
          Nancy, disarmed by the glowing praise, turns back to Emily.
                         
                          NANCY
           We'll talk about this later.
                         
          Storms off.
                         
                          LUCY
           See you next week, Nancy.
                         
          Nancy doesn't hear, busily reassuring parents, damage
          control. Emily and Lucy arrive at the elevator. Emily hits
          the button.
                         
                          EMILY
           You're never going back there.
                         
                          LUCY
           Why, Emily?
           75.
                         
                         
          Emily says nothing. Lucy keeps asking the same question, in
          the exact same intonation, as Emily ignores her:
                         
                          LUCY
           Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
                         
          DING. The doors open.
                         
          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
                         
          Emily and Lucy step in. The door closes. Lucy continuing
          her verbal assault as they start to descend:
                         
                          LUCY
           Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
                         
          Suddenly the ELEVATOR LURCHES TO A VIOLENT STOP. It buckles
          Emily's knees. She is terrified, practically
          hyperventilating.
                         
                          EMILY
           W-w-what's happening - ?!
                         
          Lucy has gotten her attention.
                         
                          LUCY
           Can I go back to group next week?
                         
                          EMILY
           You're never going back there!
                         
          Lucy looks at her as one regards a small dumb animal. Then
          looks up at the ceiling.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you sure?
                         
          Horror as Emily realizes what she's thinking. We hear the
          first CABLE SNAP above them. In the CREAKING HUSH that
                         FOLLOWS:
                         
                          EMILY
           No...
                         
          The second CABLE SNAPS. The elevator goes into a HELLISH
          FREE FALL.
                         
          The acceleration is dizzying.
                         
          Emily clutches the rail with both hands, SCREAMING as the
          elevator goes cannonballing down the shaft. Lucy indifferent
          as they plummet toward certain death.
           76.
                         
                         
          The floor indicator light races toward L, the car shuddering
          violently, the noise deafening. It's a horrible way to die.
                         
          Emily closes her eyes in anticipation of impact. And in the
          sudden BLACKNESS there's no noise at all. Just a soft,
                         DISTINCT
                         
          DING.
                         
          A breathless pause then Emily opens her eyes. And sees the
          elevator is no longer falling. Never was. The doors glide
          open to the first floor lobby.
                         
          Lucy gives her a quiet look and strolls out. A businessman
          steps into the elevator, watching bewildered as Emily
          releases her white-knuckled grip on the railing and staggers
          out, so badly shaken she can barely stand...
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Fish swim languidly in the tank. It's after midnight. We're
          looking down the darkened hall at Emily's closed bedroom
          door.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Emily, in a coat and shoes, packing a suitcase. Snaps it
          quietly shut. Looks over at the barricaded door. Draws a
          tense breath.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          From down the hall we hear the DEADBOLTS SLIDE QUIETLY OPEN.
                         
          The door opens a crack.
                         
          EMILY'S TERRIFIED FACE peers out. Making sure the hall is
          empty.
                         
          She steps out, suitcase in hand.
                         
          Tiptoes down the hall. Quietly as possible as she comes past
          Lucy's door. It's open a crack. The room pitch black
          inside. Emily steps closer, breath held. Peers in through
          the little crack. Sees -
                         
          LUCY ASLEEP IN BED.
                         
          But suddenly her EYES SNAP OPEN. Her face horizontal on the
          pillow.
                         
                          LUCY
           I can see you.
           77.
                         
                         
          Emily backs away. Goes quickly to the front door.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          Emily throws the suitcase in the trunk. Slams it shut.
          Comes around to the driver's side door. Jumps in. Closes
          the door. And gets the scare of her life.
                         
          LUCY IS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT!
                         
          Emily recoils with a SCREAM, throwing her body against the
          window behind her. Lucy sits there, silent, betrayed.
                         
          It's too much for Emily. She breaks down. Buries her face
          in her hands and sobs.
                         
          Lucy, after a moment, takes a brush from Emily's bag and
          starts lovingly brushing her hair.
                         
          Emily slowly lifts her head, resigning herself to this latest
          horror. She sits zombie-like behind the wheel, tears
          streaming as Lucy tugs gently at the snarls, playing mommy.
                         
                          LUCY
           Don't be sad. This is your new
           beginning.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY
                         
          Unopened mail and new case files piling up. Emily looks
          terrible, phone to ear, getting SCREAMED at, sworn at,
          interrupted every time she tries to speak.
                         
                          EMILY
           Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let -
           that's not what I said - no, I did not -
           you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will
           you let me respond? - will you let me -
           Mrs Lynch - will you let -
                         
          Emily can't take it anymore. She unloads.
                         
                          EMILY
           SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE
           WOMAN BEFORE I GET IN MY CAR AND COME
           OVER THERE AND BEAT YOUR ASS LIKE YOU
           BEAT YOUR SON! I HAVE YOUR ADDRESS!
           THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU CALL AND
           SWEAR AT ME! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE!
                         
          Slams the phone down. Sits there looking rather dazed.
          Wayne arrives, dazed in a different way, having overheard.
           78.
                         
                         
                          WAYNE
           Um, so, I notice you haven't taken any
           personal days. Come on, you look like
           crap, go home.
                         
          Emily levels a withering stare.
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't want to go home.
                         
          EXT. LOS ANGELES APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Emily knocking on a door in an outside hallway. It opens.
          It's the girl from the bar. BECCA. The friend. Not
          expecting her.
                         
                          BECCA
           Emily...
                         
          INT. BECCA'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Emily, disheveled, five days without sleep, doing her best to
          appear rational.
                         
                          EMILY
           I know I haven't been a great friend
           lately, but... do you think maybe I could
           crash here for a couple of nights?
                         
                          BECCA
           Sure, when?
                         
                          EMILY
           Tonight and tomorrow.
                         
          Becca draws air through her teeth, pained by her predicament.
                         
                          BECCA
           Em, any other weekend you know I'd say
           yes, but I just met this guy and he's
           coming over tonight like for the night
           and it might be, you know, kinda weird.
                         
          Emily nods. And there's nothing more to be said.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Stormy night. Heavy rain. High winds. The trees, thrashing
          outside the window, backlit by a streetlight, cast OMINOUS
          SHADOWS on the walls of the bedroom.
                         
          Emily huddles in the corner, wrapped in a blanket, clutching
          the screwdriver.
           79.
                         
                         
          There is a KNOCK on the bedroom door. Emily's EYES JERK WIDE
          OPEN. She looks at the door, but doesn't answer.
                         
          After a moment, Lucy's voice, innocent, afraid -
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Emily...? Can I come in? I'm scared...
                         
          Emily says nothing. Heart racing. There's another KNOCK. A
          little louder.
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Emily? Please? I know you're in there,
           please...?
                         
          Emily says nothing. Lucy starts pounding on the door.
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Please, Emily...
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          Emily listening, barely breathing. Is that it? Is she gone?
                         
          And then suddenly - WHAM! - WHAM! - WHAM! - the pounding
          turns VIOLENT, practically shaking the door off its hinges.
          Far too violent for a little girl.
                         
          Emily wedges herself into the corner, absolutely petrified.
          There is something very strong and very angry on the other
          side of that door, SHRIEKING in the voice of a child -
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           LET ME IN!
                         
          WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM!
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           LET ME IN!
                         
          WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM! The door getting
          absolutely pummeled, looking like it might splinter from the
          force. And it's so intense that it's almost surreal what
          Emily is seeing. Lucy's voice eerily monotone, the words
          coming inhumanly fast like some auctioneer from hell -
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me
           in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let
           me in, let me in, let me in...
           80.
                         
                         
          Relentless. Tormenting Emily. Until she can't take it
          anymore. And she SCREAMS as loud as she can, half cursing,
          half begging, the veins standing out in her neck -
                         
                          EMILY
           LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
                         
          And the POUNDING STOPS DEAD. All we hear is the rain
          drumming on the roof. And Emily's QUICK TERRIFIED BREATHS as
          she stares at the door wondering what's next.
                         
          But there's nothing. Just the shadows dancing on the walls.
          It appears the nightmare is over for now.
                         
          But not quite.
                         
          A sudden CLUNK in the closet makes her jump. Her head snaps
          around - what was that? She just stares, unable to breathe
          because whatever she just heard is INSIDE HER ROOM!
                         
          White-knuckled grip on that screwdriver, Emily stands up and
          comes slowly over to the CLOSET DOOR.
                         
          Raises the screwdriver. Ready to stab.
                         
          Takes hold of the door handle.
                         
          Slowly turns it.
                         
          Opens the door.
                         
          PITCH BLACK inside.
                         
          A tense pause as she stares into that blackness, then reaches
          a hand into the closet, feeling around for the pull-string.
          Finds it. Gives it a tug. And there, right in front of her,
          is a vision of unspeakable horror:
                         
                         MARGARET SHERIDAN
                         
          Twitching spasmodically in a hospital gown. HIDEOUSLY
          BURNED.
                         
          She comes at Emily arms flailing, clumsy with rage and
          dementia. Emily leaps aside and Margaret goes careening into
          the furniture, howling and spinning like some crazed Whirling
          Dervish.
                         
          Emily scrambles over the bed. Reaches the door. Fumbles at
          the deadbolt. Here comes Margaret. At the last second Emily
          gets the door open. Runs out.
           81.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Tears a path down the dark hallway. Margaret right behind
          her, hideous, reeling, hitting the walls with her flailing
          arms.
                         
          Emily throws open the front door.
                         
          EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Dashes from the house into the abandoned street. Running in
          the rain. Margaret comes crashing out of the house, chasing
          her down the middle of the street.
                         
          Emily sees a city bus parked up ahead. Makes a run for it.
                         
          EXT. METRO BUS - NIGHT
                         
          A metro transit bus idling along the curb. The DRIVER with
          his feet up between shifts, reading a porno mag. Emily comes
          running up to the door. Pounds frantically on the glass.
                         
                          EMILY
           Help me! Please!
                         
          The driver meets eyes with her through the door. Keeps
          reading. Unimpressed. More pounding from Emily.
                         
                          EMILY
           Let me on!
                         
          The driver points to the sign above the door: OUT OF SERVICE.
          Keeps reading. Emily near hysterics at this point. Margaret
          closing in fast.
                         
                          EMILY
           She's coming! Please!
                         
          The driver sighs, weighing his obligations. Emily spins,
          back to the door. Margaret nearly upon her, ten feet away,
          five, four...
                         
          INT. METRO BUS - NIGHT
                         
          The driver opens the door. Emily dives backwards onto the
          bus, the door snapping closed in front of her just as
          Margaret lunges for her throat.
                         
                          EMILY
           Drive!
                         
                          BUS DRIVER
           There's nobody out there.
           82.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           DRIVE!
                         
                          BUS DRIVER
           There - is - nobody - out - there!
                         
          It sinks in the second time. Emily scans the sidewalk, the
          darkened streets outside the bus. Margaret is gone. Was
          never there. The driver opens the door, nods to her - out.
                         
          EXT. METRO BUS - NIGHT
                         
          With a hydraulic HISS the bus releases its brakes and diesels
          off down the empty street. Emily stands alone. Rain-soaked.
          Shivering. Staring at her house down the block.
                         
          The SILHOUETTE OF A CHILD in the window.
                         
          INT. CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Wayne and his BOYFRIEND shake rain off an umbrella as they
          cross the darkened office.
                         
                          BOYFRIEND
           (re: the office space)
           No, I like it. It's like those things
           they put baby cows in to make veal -
                         
          The boyfriend slows as they go past a cubicle. Saw something
          weird.
                         
                          WAYNE
           What?
                         
          He points. Freaked. Wayne comes over, pokes his head in a
          cubicle.
                         
                         EMILY
                         
          head down on her desk, rain-soaked, sleeping in her chair.
                         
                          WAYNE
           Em...?
                         
          No reply. Wayne's face darkens. Is she dead? He comes
          over, puts his hand on her shoulder.
                         
                          WAYNE
           Emily...?
                         
          She awakens with a jolt. Expecting to see Margaret. She
          looks terrible.
           83.
                         
                         
                          WAYNE
           Jesus - are you okay?
                         
                          EMILY
                          (HOARSE WHISPER)
           I... I had some things to catch up on...
                         
          She fumbles unconvincingly at some loose paperwork.
                         
                          WAYNE
           You look like shit, you need to see a
           doctor.
                         
                          EMILY
           I saw a doctor.
                         
                          WAYNE
           What did they say?
                         
                          EMILY
                          (LOSES IT)
           They said mind your own fucking business!
                         
          Shocked by the outburst, by her general appearance, he walks
          away, muttering to his boyfriend. Emily puts her head in her
          hands, pressing down at her temples. Wayne steps into his
          office in the b.g. and grabs something then they exit.
                         
          And the office is quiet again. Emily closes her eyes. Just
          then, she hears -
                         
          A faint CYCLICAL SQUEAKING NOISE in the cubicle right next to
          hers. Goes rigid. Recognizes the sound. Calls over the
          partition without moving.
                         
                          EMILY
           Wayne...?
                         
          No reply, but the SQUEAKING CONTINUES. Rising slowly from
          her seat, scared as hell, she leans over her desk and peers
          over the partition into the adjacent cubicle.
                         
          It's empty. But the OFFICE CHAIR IS TURNING as if someone
          were just playing there.
                         
          Emily steps slowly back. And now hears the same CYCLICAL
          SQUEAKING behind her. The opposite row. She spins.
                         
          EXT. CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Walks slowly from her cubicle. Comes along the row of
          darkened cubicles, following the sound to its source. This
          is the one. She looks in.
           84.
                         
                         
          Empty cubicle. TURNING CHAIR.
                         
          Emily backs away. Terrified. The chair winding slowly to a
          stop.
                         
          Suddenly, behind her, at the far end of the office, a
          different NOISE splits the silence. Emily turns and stares
          toward the sound. The XEROX MACHINE. Someone is using it.
                         
                          EMILY
           Hello...?
                         
          No answer.
                         
          Emily comes slowly down the aisle to the partitioned
          workstation. A torturous walk set to the RHYTHMIC CADENCE of
          the photocopier, the HARSH GREEN LIGHT SWEEPING ACROSS THE
          CEILING ABOVE IT, again and again and again...
                         
          And then it stops, ejecting one final page as Emily enters
          the workstation. And sees there's no one there.
                         
          She stares at the idle machine for a moment, then at the
          STACK OF COPIES lying upsidedown in the tray. She comes
          over, picks them up. Turns them over.
                         
          The first page is a photocopy of a PAIR OF HANDS PRESSED FLAT
          AGAINST THE COPYING GLASS.
                         
          Emily stares, haunted. Tense breath. Continues through the
          stack.
                         
          Successive pages show the same two hands, but leaning forward
          into the inky blackness between them is a FACE, its features
          resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass. The
          last page is a horrific image. A man screaming in such
          terror that his face appears almost deformed.
                         
          It's DOUG. The night of his death. Like a snapshot from his
          bathroom mirror.
                         
          Emily shudders, the stack of pages tumbling to the floor.
          Runs out. And we see the photocopies, lying on the floor,
          are totally BLANK...
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, CHILD SERVICES BUILDING - NIGHT
                         
          Emily, leaving, rushes down a corridor toward the lobby.
          Tense. Head on a swivel. Hears MORE SQUEAKING behind her.
          Spins.
                         
          A NIGHT JANITOR WHEELING A MOP BUCKET
           85.
                         
                         
          She walks on. Turns the corner and RUNS INTO SOMEONE
          UNEXPECTED. Jumps back with a SHRIEK before she realizes who
          it is.
                         
                          EMILY
           Robin...
                         
          A ponytailed woman in her mid-forties, the child placement
          specialist Emily called from home.
                         
                          ROBIN
           What are you doing here so late? I tried
           calling you. I found someone to take
           Lucy.
                         
                          EMILY
                          (STUNNED RELIEF)
           You did?
                         
                          ROBIN
           Anaheim couple. They've helped us out
           before.
                         
          She shows Emily a custody form with an attached photo:
                         
          A KIND HUSBAND AND WIFE WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN.
                         
          Emily's face darkens.
                         
                          EMILY
           (under her breath)
           Oh God...
                         
                          ROBIN
           What's the matter?
                         
          Emily stares at the unsuspecting family. Lucy's next
          victims. She fends off a wave of emotion as the full horror
          of her predicament hits her. Then, matter-of-factly, facing
          that fear head-on:
                         
                          EMILY
           I can't. I'm keeping her.
                         
          As Emily walks off, ripping the custody form to shreds, Robin
          utterly confused...
                         
          INT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Emily sits opposite Edward Sheridan in the visiting room, an
          odd sense of camaraderie between them.
           86.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           If I get rid of her, if I put her into
           the system...
                         
                          EDWARD
                          (NODS YUP)
           She starts all over again somewhere else.
           Can't let her stay, can't let her go.
           That leaves you with one option.
                         
          Eye contact. Emily looks away, shakes her head.
                         
                          EMILY
           I can't, Edward, I --
                         
                          EDWARD
           You have to. You have to find the
           strength. Don't you understand? That's
           why she's doing this. To test you. Test
           your faith.
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't have any faith.
                         
                          EDWARD
           How `bout anger. Got some of that?
                         
          Emily lowers her gaze to the table.
                         
                          EMILY
           How... how do I...?
                         
                          EDWARD
           Kill her? In her sleep, assuming you
           can...
                          (THEN; THINKING)
           Tell you what I'd do different. Count
           myself dead at the outset. Accept that
           going in and use it to my advantage.
           That's the one thing I don't think she'd
           see coming, someone giving up their own
           life to take hers.
                         
          As Emily registers this...
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Middle of the night, the living room is lit by the eerie glow
          of the fish tank. The filter humming. The fish swimming
          languidly. Suddenly they DISPERSE, spooked by something
          outside the tank.
           87.
                         
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The bureau has been pushed in front of the deadbolted door to
          form a barricade. Emily lies in a fetal position on her bed,
          exhausted but unable to sleep.
                         
          She tenses at the sound of a MUFFLED MALE VOICE in the other
          room. Comes over to the door, trying to listen. Thinks she
          recognizes it.
                         
                          EMILY
           (calls through door)
           Mike...?
                         
          No reply.
                         
          A moment of indecision then Emily tightens her grip on the
          screwdriver and quietly slides open the deadbolts.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          She comes slowly down the hall, following the VOICE to its
          source, stops in the living room doorway, haunted...
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
                         THE TELEVISION
                         
          Edward's psych interview playing to the empty room. He's
          straightjacketed, sedated. Talking directly to the camera.
                         
                          EDWARD
           Where is she now? Some family somewhere?
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Why does that concern you, Edward?
                         
                          EDWARD
           `Cause you have to warn them.
                         
          Emily turns off the tv. IMMEDIATELY IT SWITCHES ITSELF BACK
          ON. Emily freezes, realizing the room is not empty.
          Turning, she sees Lucy sitting in the shadows holding the
          remote. Lucy mutes the sound and returns Emily's stare,
          thoughtful, almost empathetic.
                         
                          LUCY
           I like it here. I like you. You want me
           to like you, don't you?
                         
          Emily nods. The room bathed in the tv's flickering blue
          light. Lucy is quiet for a moment. Then, in her innocently
          menacing voice, explains the rules:
           88.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           You have to do what I say. If I say I
           want to go to group, you have to do it.
           If I say I want a new dress, you have to
           do it. If I say I want ice cream every
           day after school, you have to do it.
           Okay?
                         
          Emily gives a haunted nod, remembering:
                         
          A FLASHCUT of Lucy sitting between Edward and Margaret at the
          Child Services meeting, new dress, ribbon in her hair,
          licking her ice cream with a wicked little smile.
                         
          BACK TO SCENE
                         
          Lucy stares coldly at the television: Margaret speaking with
          the sound off.
                         
                          LUCY
           They did what I said for a while and then
           they stopped and started with the
           secrets. But they weren't really secrets
           I guess...
           (looks at Emily)
           ...because I always knew what they were
           thinking.
                         
          She holds Emily's gaze then looks back at the tv. Margaret's
          image reflected in the pupils of her eerie unblinking eyes.
                         
          INT. MARGARET'S PADDED ROOM, PSYCH HOSPITAL - NIGHT
                         
          Margaret, straps unbuckled, sits on the bed beside a YOUNG
          NURSE who checks her temperature. Done, the Nurse heads out.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Don't leave me.
                         
          Terror in Margaret's voice.
                         
                          YOUNG NURSE
           It's okay, Maggie. I'll check on you
           later.
                         
          The Nurse exits. Locks the door.
                         
          CLICK-KA-THUNK. The sound of doom to Margaret.
                         
          She stands up, looking around, trembling at what's to come.
          Her footsteps sound oddly HOLLOW, METALLIC on the floor.
           89.
                         
                         
          MARGARET'S POV - surveying the room, we see what Margaret's
          hell looks like. It's not a room she's living in...
                         
          AN OLD OVEN
                         
          With dark scorched metal walls. A bolted-down bed to one
          side, perfectly white, like a practical joke.
                         
          We can hear the low HISS of it filling with gas. The faint
          POOF as it ignites beneath her. The first SHIMMERING WAVES
          OF HEAT rising up, singeing her hair.
                         
          Margaret runs screaming to the door, claws at the pane of
          glass like a madwoman. But there is no escape from the hell
          of her own mind. The YOUNG NURSE'S FACE APPEARS there in the
          window, shocked by Margaret's insane rantings.
                         
          INT. PSYCH HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT
                         
          Edward, dinner tray in hand, going through the cafeteria line
          with other INSTITUTIONAL PATIENTS.
                         
          He sits down at a table and starts eating, quiet, lost in his
          thoughts. Takes another mouthful of food and suddenly stops
          chewing, noticing something very strange:
                         
          A BALD, MORBIDLY OBESE INMATE SITTING DIRECTLY ACROSS THE
          TABLE IS CUTTING PEAS IN HALF ON HIS PLATE, ABSENTLY, BUT
          WITH AN ALMOST SURGICAL PRECISON, EATING THEM ONE BY ONE OFF
          THE TIP OF HIS KNIFE!!
                         
          He lifts his gaze to Edward. Smiles a knowing, taunting
          smile. Then his WIDE WET MOUTH speaks in a little girl's
                         VOICE:
                         
                          LUCY'S VOICE
           I'm happy you're getting the help you
           need, daddy.
                         
          Edward goes berserk. Launches himself across the table at
          the guy, stabbing him in the neck with his fork. Vicious
          attack. Unprovoked as far as anyone else is concerned. A
          guard rushes over. Edward turns on him, maniacal.
                         
          THE GUARD SHOOTS HIM DEAD.
                         
          As blood pools around Edward's body, some LUNATIC who
          witnessed the event starts to applaud. Others join in. It's
          the most excitement they've seen all year. And as the
          applause spreads through the entire cafeteria...
           90.
                         
                         
          EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily comes down the steps, past the morning paper on the
          walkway. Stops dead in her tracks. Stunned. Comes back and
          picks it up.
                         
          A SMALL PHOTO OF EDWARD ON THE FRONT PAGE WITH A HEADLINE:
          HOSPITAL PROBES DEATH.
                         
          At the bus stop at the end of the street, Lucy mingles
          happily with other CHILDREN. She meets Emily's gaze down the
          length of the sidewalk. Smiles and waves goodbye as she gets
          on the school bus.
                         
          INT. BARRON'S OFFICE, POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          Emily drops the newspaper on Barron's desk. The headline
          about Edward speaks for itself.
                         
                          BARRON
           I know...
                         
          It's a different Mike Barron than last we saw. Gone is the
          quiet assurance. Whatever happened rocked him to the core.
          He closes the door for privacy.
                         
                          BARRON
           There's something I want you to hear.
           Came in at two o'clock last night. You
           might wanna sit.
                         
          Emily sits. Barron cues a voicemail message on his phone,
          plays it over the speaker. After a BEEP we hear it. A
          SINISTER MALE VOICE, guttural, taunting, the voice of a
                         DEMON:
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           (mocking his earlier line)
           `It's hard sometimes to tell the truth,
           but I know you will `cause you're a good
           little girl...'
                          (THEN; INTIMATE)
           Twenty years in the trenches, can't make
           Lieutenant? Hurts, doesn't it? Shakes
           your faith sometimes. You know why they
           keep passing you over? Do you, Michael?
           `Cause you're soft. Soft, soft, soft...
                         
          DELIRIOUS LAUGHTER followed by a CLICK and a DIAL TONE.
          Emily's mouth gapes. After a moment:
           91.
                         
                         
                          BARRON
           You're right. She called Doug. Took me
           an extra couple of days to get your cell
           phone records. That's what she's been
           using.
                         
          Grim pause. Emily digs through her bag. Reaches the bottom.
          No cell phone. Staring into the bag, voice wavering with
                         EMOTION:
                         
                          EMILY
           She's taking me apart, Mike.
                         
          She loses it for a second. Barron sits in front of her on
          the edge of the desk.
                         
                          BARRON
           I'm gonna help you get to the bottom of
           this.
                         
                          EMILY
           (re: Edward's photo)
           He told me I have to kill her.
                         
          Barron registers that in silence. Stuns her, and himself, by
          what he says next.
                         
                          BARRON
           I'll help you.
                         
          Emily looks at him. Disbelief.
                         
                          BARRON
           Whatever it takes.
                         
          She hugs him. A godsend.
                         
                          BARRON
           I'm gonna put Beth and Tim in a hotel.
           Keep her at the house.
                         
          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Emily buttoning her shirt after an exam.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Physically you're fine. How's the
           stress?
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm not sleeping, I was hoping you could
           give me something.
           92.
                         
                         
          The doctor writes on her prescription pad.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Take one of these, you'll sleep.
                         
          Emily watches the pen scribble.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY
                         
          A prescription pill bottle on the passenger seat. Emily,
          driving home, glances at it with apprehension.
                         
          EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
                         
          A high-rise hotel in downtown Los Angeles.
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Barron, saying goodbye to his WIFE and SON, sets down the
          overnight bags they've packed.
                         
                          BARRON'S WIFE
           Why won't you tell me what's going on?
                         
                          BARRON
           Because I can't.
                         
          Kisses her. Turns to his son.
                         
                          BARRON
           Take care of your mom.
                         
          Musses the boy's hair and leaves.
                         
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Barron strides down the corridor, his face reflecting the
          grim task ahead.
                         
          INT. HOTEL PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT
                         
          His footsteps echo in the parking structure as he walks along
          a row of parked cars.
                         
          A faint JANGLING SOUND stops him dead in his tracks. He
          turns and scans the garage behind him. It's quiet, eerily
          still.
                         
          He continues onward, but hears the faint JANGLING SOUND again
          a moment later. Spins, trying to place it. There it is
          again. Closer this time. Something moving, hiding, behind
          the rows of cars over there.
           93.
                         
                         
          He bends, trying to get a look under the cars. Can't see
          anything. Unnerved, he moves on, clicks the button on his
          keychain remote. The lights flash on his car fifty yards
          away.
                         
          But as he continues toward it they reveal themselves,
          trodding into view from between the cars, CHOKE-CHAIN COLLARS
          JANGLING around their necks...
                         
          THREE PIT BULLS
                         
          Battle-scarred. Vicious. The dogs from Diego's house. They
          sit down right in front of Barron's car. It's a surreal
          moment, a trio of attack dogs sitting at quiet attention,
          square-jawwed, black-eyed, the kinetic calm before a predator
          strikes.
                         
          Barron draws his gun. Fires a warning shot over their heads.
                         
          BANG!
                         
          Deafeningly loud, it echoes through the garage like a
          thunderclap. But the dogs don't move, just sit there
          staring.
                         
          Barron lowers his gun. It's time to get the hell out of
          here. He backpedals, making no sudden movements, gun still
          trained on the dogs.
                         
          They watch him, eyes livening with excitement, one of their
          back legs twitching in anticipation.
                         
          Barron quickens his step and that's their cue.
                         
          ALL AT ONCE, WITH EXPLOSIVE SPEED, THE DOGS SPRING INTO
          MOTION, VICIOUS AND MUSCLED AND SMELLING BLOOD.
                         
          Barron fires an errant shot and takes off running. But he
          can't match their pace, the deadly trio race along the row of
          police cruisers, closing the gap with ease.
                         
          At the last second Barron jumps the partition. The pit bulls
          crash skull-first into the concrete, but continue their
          pursuit unfazed as Barron takes off up the adjoining ramp.
                         
          He jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods,
          denting the metal. The dogs jump up behind him, relentless
          in their pursuit.
                         
          Jaws snapping at his heels, Barron takes to the car roofs,
          the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him.
           94.
                         
                         
          He looks back just in time to see the dogs launch themselves.
          They hit him at chest height, sinking teeth in his flesh.
                         
          Stumbling forward, struggling to keep their jaws from his
          throat, Barron doesn't see what's coming. The last car. The
          edge of the parking garage.
                         
          He's over the edge before he even understands, flailing his
          arms for a handhold that doesn't exist. The ground, far
          below, flies up at him in a rush of acceleration.
                         
          We hear a sickening THUD and find Barron lying face down on
          the pavement below, blood pooling around him. Clinging to
          life, he opens his eyes and sees the TRIO OF PIT BULLS
          SITTING OBEDIENTLY BESIDE HIM, unharmed, watching.
                         
          But from a distance we see there is only Barron. Dying alone
          between the parked cars. No dogs anywhere in sight.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Emily opens the front door, peers in, trying not to make a
          sound.
                         
                          EMILY
           Lucy...?
                         
          No reply. She enters. Sees -
                         
          THE CLOSET DOOR IS OPEN.
                         
          She comes closer.
                         
          EMPTY BANKER BOXES strewn in the hall. SCATTERED PAGES.
                         
          At the far end, the light is on in Lucy's bedroom. The door
          open a crack. A shaft of light spilling out into the
          darkened hallway.
                         
          Emily comes down the hallway past SCATTERED FILE PAGES.
          Preliminary reports. Medical records. Personality
          profiles...
                         
          She opens the door to Lucy's room.
                         
          INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Freezes in the doorway, shocked by what lies before her.
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh my God...
           95.
                         
                         
          Black eyes. Bloody noses. Bruises. Cuts. Burns. PHOTOS
          OF ABUSED CHILDREN COVER THE ENTIRE FLOOR. A collage of
          misery.
                         
          Lucy is nowhere to be seen. Emily comes in and starts
          quickly picking them up.
                         
          Tucked between the file cabinet and the wall is a CORKBOARD.
          Emily pulls it out. It's covered with PHOTOS FROM WORK.
          COWORKERS. HER KIDS. Two of the photos are turned around.
          She flips them over in rapid succession. Diego. Doug.
                         
          She rips all the photos from the board.
                         
          Photos bunched in her hands, she heads for the door, but
          hears something that stops her in her tracks -
                         
          A strange INTERMITTENT BUZZING NOISE
                         
          It lasts two seconds and stops. She turns around, scans the
          room. Puts down the stack of photos. There it is again:
                         
          BZZZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZZZT.
                         
          Sounds like a housefly trapped against a window, but it's
          bigger, angrier, and appears to be coming from the
                         
                         KNOTTED RUG
                         
          at the foot of Lucy's bed. Emily crosses to it. The BUZZING
          STOPS. She bends. Takes hold of a corner. Peels it slowly
          back to reveal
                         
                         BARE FLOOR
                         
          Weird. Nothing there.
                         
          BZZZZZZZZZZZZZT! BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT!
                         
          Emily straightens, turns. It's coming from the
                         
                         BED
                         
          As she approaches it the BUZZING INTENSIFIES, louder, more
          agitated.
                         
          Pauses as she gets there, terrified of what she might find,
          the bed BUZZING FURIOUSLY FROM WITHIN. Something is trapped
          under those blankets, waiting for release.
                         
          Emily extends a trembling hand, takes hold of the blankets
          and, slowly, rigid with fear, peels them back to reveal
           96.
                         
                         
                         BARE MATTRESS
                         
          Impossible, because the BUZZING IS LOUDER THAN EVER.
                         
          With a tense swallow Emily realizes it's coming from lower,
          deeper within the bed, between the mattress and the box
          spring.
                         
          She slips her fingers into the crack.
                         
          And slowly lifts the mattress, the BUZZING GROWING
          FRIGHTENINGLY LOUD as its source is exposed, something
          hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to
          see what lies below -
                         
          HER CELL PHONE
                         
          Vibrating. BZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZT. On the viewscreen:
          "INCOMING CALL..."
                         
          She picks it up. Stares at it vibrating in her hand.
          Presses the TALK button. Brings it to her ear.
                         
          The LOW STATIC of an open line. Then, a RASPY MALE VOICE:
                         
           MALE VOICE ON PHONE
           Emily...
                         
          Emily flinches.
                         
                          EMILY
           Who is this...?
                         
           MALE VOICE ON PHONE
           It's Wayne, Emily, I just got a call,
           Mike's dead...
                         
          Emily, stunned, barely able to speak.
                         
                          EMILY
           No... he's...
                         
           WAYNE (V.O.)
           They don't know if he fell or what
           happened...
                         
          Emily's phone hand drops to her side in shock. From down
          there, we hear Wayne's voice:
                         
           WAYNE (V.O.)
           Emily? Emily, are you okay...?
                         
          After a moment, she lifts it.
           97.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           I have to go.
                         
          Hangs up. On the brink of emotional collapse. Her only
          confidante dead.
                         
          Just then she hears BREATHING from behind the open door.
          Someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there.
          She crosses to it. Pulls back the door and there sits
                         
                         LUCY
                         
          quiet, innocent, chin on her knees.
                         
                          EMILY
           What did you do to him?
                         
          Lucy says nothing. Emily grabs her by the arm. Yanks her to
          her feet.
                         
                          EMILY
           WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!
                         
          After a moment:
                         
                          LUCY
           He did it to himself.
                         
          WHACK! Emily slaps her. Hard across the face. Knocks her
          to the floor. Lucy sits up, lip split. Tastes the blood
          with her tongue. Hint of a smile. The taste of victory.
                         
                          LUCY
           Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The
           moons of Jupiter. We got back our
           astronomy tests today.
                         
          It's there on the floor. A++ Well done, Lucy!
                         
          There's a LOUD BEEP in the other room. Lucy gets up and
          walks out. Emily watches as Lucy goes into the kitchen.
          Takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave. Empties it into a
          bowl. Sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv
          remote, watching it like nothing ever happened. Emily walks
          over and pitches the tv onto the floor. The SCREEN SHATTERS.
                         
                          EMILY
           Get out of my house.
                         
          Lucy, unimpressed, expressionless, takes another handful of
          popcorn. Chews it. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Emily swats
          the bowl from her hands.
           98.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           GET OUT!
                         
          Flicking bits of popcorn off herself, Lucy stands up from the
          sofa. Her face catches the light from the hallway. Emily
          shudders at the sight.
                         
          Lucy's features look altered somehow, sharpened. It's
          subtle, but the overall effect is chilling. THE FACE OF A
          LITTLE GIRL LAID OVER THE MUSCULATURE OF SOMETHING MORE
          DEVIOUS AND WICKED.
                         
                          LUCY
           Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to
           yell at me.
                         
          Emily backs away, mortified, takes off down the hall.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Rushes in. Slams the door. Bolts the deadbolts. CLUNK.
          CLUNK. CLUNK. Moment of panic. Will they hold?
                         
          Slides her bureau in front of the door. Shoves her bed in
          front of the bureau just to be sure.
                         
          In the silence we hear LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall
          toward the door.
                         
          Closer, closer...
                         
          There's nothing else to block the door with. Emily backs
          away, trembling as
                         
          LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS arrive at the door. A tense silence. Then:
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Emily... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to...
                         
          Emily grabs the screwdriver, clutches it in both hands.
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Can I come in so we can talk and work it
           out?
                         
          There's a GENTLE KNOCK on the door. Emily flinches,
          remembering last time.
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Emily...?
                         
                          EMILY
           Stay away from me!
           99.
                         
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Don't be mad. I said I was sorry. I'll
           brush your hair for you.
                         
                          EMILY
           STAY AWAY FROM ME!!
                         
          Silence.
                         
                         THEN:
                         
          WHAM! The door shudders from a MAMMOTH IMPACT. Last time,
          it shook the door, this time it shakes the entire wall.
          Emily recoils, dropping the screwdriver.
                         
          WHAM! CRACKS APPEAR in the door as it bows from the
          tremendous force.
                         
          WHAM!! CRACKS FAN OUT into the plaster around the doorframe.
                         
          WHAM!! Half the SCREWS HOLDING THE HINGES fly from the wall.
                         
          WHAM!! The DEADBOLTS BENDING from the ungodly pummeling.
                         
          WHAM!! The DEADBOLT SCREWS getting yanked from the wood.
                         
          Emily frozen in terror, watching. Whatever's out there is
          coming in.
                         
          WHAM!! One of the DOOR HINGES rips clean from the wall.
                         
          WHAM!! The FIRST DEADBOLT comes flying off.
                         
          WHAM!! The SECOND DOOR HINGE gone.
                         
          WHAM!! ANOTHER DEADBOLT flies off.
                         
          WHAM!! The DOOR SPLITS down the center.
                         
          WHAM!! The THIRD DEADBOLT lands on the floor at Emily's feet
          with a METAL THUD.
                         
          A breathless silence.
                         
          Then the DOOR RATTLES and drops loose from the frame with a
          DEAD WOODEN CLUNK.
                         
          Nothing holding it in place now except the bureau and the
          bed. And now they both start to SLIDE BACKWARDS as whatever
          is on the other side starts pushing its way in.
           100.
                         
                         
          Emily topples a high bookcase against the door and pushes
          back with every ounce of strength she can muster, but it's no
          use. The bureau overturns, CRASHES to the floor. Emily's
          bare feet slide backwards along with the bed.
                         
          And then they stop. The barricade sufficiently breached.
                         
          Emily, in her panic, makes a hasty decision. She hides under
          the bed.
                         
          We HOLD LOW on the open door as LUCY'S FEET step into the
          room, the feet of a child, but the BREATHING we hear sounds
          emphysemic and the VOICE is unquestionably male - harsh,
          guttural, taunting Emily as it comes for her:
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           Emily...
                         
          Wide-eyed with terror under the bed, she watches those feet
          pick their way over the shattered remnants of the barricade.
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           Emily... We need to learn healthier ways
           of resolving conflict, Emily.
                         
          The feet step gingerly past the overturned bureau.
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           ...Most families don't even know they
           have a problem...
                         
          The feet stop at the SCREWDRIVER.
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           ...until it's too late.
                         
          A HAND reaches down and picks it up, a girl's hand, but the
          fingers as they wrap tightly around the handle look strong
          and sinewy.
                         
          The feet stand motionless for a moment then turn and come
          toward the bed, stopping right in front of EMILY'S HORRIFIED
          FACE.
                         
          A pause and then, still from Emily's POV, we see Lucy lower
          herself onto her knees.
                         
          WHAM!! - with shocking force that hand IMPALES THE
          SCREWDRIVER IN THE WOODEN FLOOR!
                         
          Another pause then both hands come into view, palms flat on
          the hardwood, as she leans her head down.
           101.
                         
                         
          Emily recoiling in anticipation as the face comes into view -
                         
          LUCY'S INNOCENT FACE
                         
          A little girl. With a little girl voice to match.
                         
                          LUCY
                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           What are you doing, you silly
           pumpkinhead?
                         
          Emily, hyperventilating, stares in shock. Lucy reaches her
          hand in. Emily backs away, wedges herself in the corner.
                         
                          LUCY
                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           You don't want me to come under there and
           get you, do you?
                         
          Emily, crying now, shakes her head. Lucy, almost
          sympathetic, frowns.
                         
                          LUCY
                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           I'm going to count to three. One...
                         
                          EMILY
           No...
                         
                          LUCY
                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           Two... Two and a half...
                         
                          EMILY
           Please...
                         
                          LUCY
                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           Two and three quarters... Three...
                         
          Lucy starts crawling under the bed.
                         
                          LUCY
           Here I come.
                         
          Emily tries to go backwards, but there's nowhere for her to
          go.
                         
          LUCY'S FACE SLIDING CLOSER LIKE THE HEAD OF A SNAKE.
                         
          Trapped, Emily screams.
           102.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           WHAT DO YOU WANT?!!
                         
          Lucy stops crawling. Folds her arms, sets her chin on them.
          Comfortable here under the bed. Delighting in the question.
                         
                          LUCY
           What you wanted from your mother. I want
           you to love me.
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay... okay, I will, I will, I promise.
                         
          Lucy weighs Emily's surrender for a moment. Then, oddly
                         BRIGHT:
                         
                          LUCY
           Come tuck me in.
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay... I'll be right there.
                         
                          LUCY
           You better come.
                         
          Lucy slithers out and we see her feet scamper from the room.
          Emily puts her head down on the floor and cries, covering her
          mouth with her hands so she won't make a sound.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          A WHISTLING KETTLE on the stove.
                         
          Emily, still in tears, takes it from the burner. Dumps SIX
          SLEEPING PILLS from the prescription bottle. Crushes them
          with the blunt edge of a knife. Stirs them into a cup of
          Chamomile tea.
                         
          She freezes at a NOISE behind her. Looks tensely over her
          shoulder.
                         
          The fridge.
                         
          She adds sugar, continues stirring.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          We follow the TEA CUP, in Emily's hand, as she comes
          nervously down the hall to Lucy's room. We can see Lucy in
          there, waiting for her in bed. Emily, playing the part,
          dries her eyes and enters.
           103.
                         
                         
          INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Sits down on the bed, hands Lucy the tea.
                         
                          LUCY
           Chamomile.
                         
          Emily nods. The face of a loving mother. Lucy brings the
          cup to her lips, pauses.
                         
                          LUCY
           Maybe you should have it, you look
           stressed.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'll have one later.
                         
          Lucy considers this, nods okay, takes a sip of tea. Emily
          picks up a brush and brushes Lucy's hair.
                         
                          EMILY
           Tomorrow's our new beginning.
                         
                          LUCY
           I'll be good.
                         
                          EMILY
           I know.
                         
          Lucy takes a few more sips and sets the tea cup on the
          bedside table. Emily, tucking her in, gives the cup a
          nervous glance. Did she drink enough?
                         
                          EMILY
           Get some rest.
                         
                          LUCY
           Say it.
                         
                          EMILY
           I love you.
                         
                          LUCY
           Forever and ever?
                         
                          EMILY
           Forever and ever.
                         
          Emily kisses her on the forehead. Lucy looks up at her and
          for a moment she's the little girl Emily met. Innocent,
          angelic, closing her eyes for sleep. They flutter open one
          last time.
           104.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           Where are you if I need you?
                         
                          EMILY
           Right down the hall.
                         
          Lucy's eyes shut. Emily, brushing her hair, staring at the
          HALF-FULL TEA CUP.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Lucy asleep in bed. Emily watches from the door, wary,
          expecting Lucy's eyes to snap open any second.
                         
                          EMILY
           Sweetheart...?
                         
          She doesn't move, dead to the world. Or is it a game? Emily
          closes the door. Leans against the wall, shaking,
          contemplating her next move.
                         
          Wedges a chair under the door handle. Time of the essence.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Junk-filled. The door lifts to reveal Emily, silhouetted,
          looking in. Amid the clutter is a lawnmower. Beside it, a
          big can of GASOLINE.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Emily stifling sobs as she douses the walls of the house.
          The hallway, the bathroom, the kitchen, all of it.
                         
          TIP OF A MATCH strikes flint, ignites.
                         
          Emily stares at it for a long moment.
                         
          Lets it fall.
                         
          FLAMES SCURRY in a shimmering blue-gold sheet across the
          floor. Climb the walls, the entire house ablaze in a matter
          of seconds.
                         
          Emily sits and watches as the door to Lucy's bedroom is
          engulfed. It's an image straight from hell: A YOUNG WOMAN
          SITTING ON A SOFA IN A HOUSE OF FIRE.
                         
          The fish, frantic in their tank, catch Emily's eye. She goes
          over and grabs the tank.
           105.
                         
                         
          EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Smoke swirling past her, she exits the house, locking the
          front door behind her. She backs away and watches it burn,
          holding her fish tank, the only thing she saved.
                         
           TIME CUT TO:
                         
          Billowing black smoke. The house fully engulfed as fire
          engines arriving on the scene, sirens wailing. Emily
          watching with neighbors on the sidewalk as the FIREFIGHTERS
          uncoil their hoses.
                         
          The window to Lucy's bedroom is a bright red square, an
          inferno. And as Emily stares at it, disbelieving what she's
          done, the figure of a CHILD appears.
                         
                         LUCY
                         
          Her whole body ablaze. Horrific. She just stands there,
          arms at her sides, burning.
                         
          Just now the FIRE MARSHALL crosses to the onlookers. Hollers
          over the noise and commotion:
                         
                          FIRE MARSHALL
           Everybody get out okay?!
                         
          Emily wavers, not sure what to say. The Fire Marshall sees
          her indecision.
                         
                          FIRE MARSHALL
           This your house?!
           (she nods yes)
           Anybody else inside?!
           (off her hesitation)
           Ma'am...?!
                         
          Emily opens her mouth to reply, but sees something behind her
          that closes her throat.
                         
                         LUCY
                         
          standing on the sidewalk in her pajamas. Unscathed.
                         
                          FIRE MARSHALL
           Anyone else inside?! Yes or no?!
                         
          Emily, in shock, shakes her head no. The Fire Marshall
          rushes off, walkie-talkie squawking. Emily stands frozen as
          Lucy comes through the crowd to her. More dismayed than
          angry.
           106.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           That was mean.
                         
          She takes Emily's hand. Together they watch the house burn.
          Firelight playing on their faces. The fish bouncing off the
          glass in the tank at Emily's feet.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          The blue halflight before dawn. Emily and Lucy sit in the
          Volvo, eyeing the scorched remains of the house. The
          firecrew stowing equipment. Emily puts the car in drive.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAWN
                         
          The FISH FLOATING DEAD at the top of the tank in the back
          seat as Emily drives down the freeway at daybreak. Lucy
          gazing out dreamily at the sunrise.
                         
                          LUCY
           Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming
           pool.
                         
          Emily says nothing. Lucy turns and looks at her, thoughtful,
          almost empathetic. She draws up her knees and rests her chin
          on top, levels an appraising stare at Emily like the one she
          leveled at Doug.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's sad, isn't it? How it gets passed
           on. How people do to their own kids what
           their parents did to them. That's why
           you got the job...
                         
          Emily turns on the radio, full volume, trying to drown out
          Lucy's voice. Lucy reaches over and turns it off. CLICK.
                         
                          LUCY
           ...To prove to yourself you're not like
           her, that you're not like your mother.
           Because that scares you. Scares you more
           than anything.
                         
          Lucy, in mock sentiment, puts her hand on Emily's.
                         
                          LUCY
           I love you... even if you don't love me.
                         
          Emily looks at her, gutted. But defiant. Turning her gaze
          forward, she tightens her grip on the wheel and calmly,
          resolutely, JAMS THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR. The
          acceleration pitches Lucy backwards into her seat. She sits
          up, eyes wide, didn't see this coming. A suicide run.
           107.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           What are you doing? Slow down.
                         
          A tense smile from Lucy. The tables have turned.
                         
                          LUCY
           Did you hear me?
                         
          Emily stares dead ahead, red-lining the tachometer. Lucy
          flits her eyes skyward. IMMEDIATELY IT DARKENS AND STARTS TO
          RAIN. Emily turns on the wipers, speeds on, unfazed.
                         
                          LUCY
           I said slow down!
                         
          Emily ignores her, going eighty now, weaving through SLOWER
          TRAFFIC THAT FLIES TOWARD THEM OUT OF THE GRAY HAZE. Lucy,
          panicking, changes channels like a tv. Innocent child all of
          a sudden.
                         
                          LUCY
           Please, stop, Emily, I'll be good.
                         
          Emily ignores her, beyond apology. And Lucy's face sharpens.
          She points down the road.
                         
                          LUCY
           Look out!
                         
          Through the heavy rain we see -
                         
          A TRACTOR-TRAILER RIG CRASH THROUGH THE DIVIDING MEDIAN AND
          JACKKNIFE, BARRELING AT THEM HEAD-ON!
                         
          Emily goes for the brake, but reconsiders, seeing the truck
          for what it is: a test of faith. She welcomes it. Tightens
          her grip on the wheel and goes full throttle again, right at
          the truck. Lucy shrieks in terror.
                         
                          LUCY
           What are you doing?!
                         
                          EMILY
           It's not real.
                         
                          LUCY
           Yes, it is!
                         
                          EMILY
           Are you scared?!
           108.
                         
                         
          Pedal to the floor. Inviting the head-on collision. You can
          see the BIG RIG DRIVER in the cab, wrestling frantically with
          the steering wheel. Lucy bracing herself, screams -
                         
                          LUCY
           STOP!
                         
          Emily clenches her teeth in anticipation of impact, of death.
                         
          THE CHROME GRILLWORK OF THE TRUCK RUSHES TOWARD THEM IN THAT
          FINAL MOMENT, THE AIR HORN DEAFENINGLY LOUD!
                         
          But the impact never comes. In the blink of an eye the truck
          is gone. Open road in front of them. It's not raining.
          Never was. The wipers SQUEAKING on a dry windshield.
                         
          Lucy sits in silence, her bag of tricks empty. Emily,
          triumphant, turns to her with a vindictive smile, the
          speedometer hitting a hundred.
                         
                          EMILY
           ARE YOU SCARED?!
                         
          She clutches Lucy's wrist.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'M NOT!!
                         
          Emily jerks the car off the road, crashing through the
          guardrail. Trees snapping in half across the hood as they go
          careening through roadside woods and down a steep embankment
                         TOWARD -
                         
          EXT. LOS ANGELES RESERVOIR - DAY
                         
          The car tears through a chainlink fence and leaps off the
          high embankment into the water.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S VOLVO - DAY
                         
          Impacts and sinks with frightening speed. Water rushing in
          from all sides. Emily shackles Lucy with her arms as the
          water rises to cover their mouths.
                         
                         UNDERWATER
                         
          They stare wide-eyed at one another through the water. Hair
          swirling around their faces as they sink to the bottom.
                         
          LUCY'S LIPS CURL INTO THAT CREEPY MANNISH SMILE.
                         
          As though she anticipated this. Or welcomes it. Or knows
          something Emily does not. And now Emily sees what Lucy sees -
           109.
                         
                         
          A FIGURE SWIMMING DOWN TOWARD THEM THROUGH THE MURKY WATER.
                         
          A HAND pries open the door and wrestles Lucy from Emily's
          grasp. Pulls her from the car, swimming to the surface with
          her. Emily is left empty-handed, stunned, alone in her
          watery grave.
                         
          SHE DROWNS IN STAGES, EACH ONE DIFFICULT TO WATCH, THE
          INITIAL FRANTIC FLAILINGS, THE HOPELESS PANIC, THE SLOW
          DAWNING OF ACCEPTANCE, THE MUSCLES LOOSENING, ARMS FLOATING
          LIMP, EYES FIXED IN A BLANK STARE.
                         
          And just when her death seems certain, a HAND grabs her by
          the shoulder and yanks her out the driver's side window...
                         
          EXT. BANK OF RESERVOIR - DAY
                         
          Ambulances. Patrol cars. Paramedics. Onshore, drying off
          with a towel, talking to a uniformed officer is the PASSERBY
          who saved Lucy's life.
                         
                          PASSERBY
           Right through the guardrail, never
           touched the brakes...
                         
          Emily goes by on a gurney, semi-conscious, oxygen mask over
          her face. Paramedics checking her vitals.
                         
          Loaded into the ambulance, she meets the gaze of Lucy who is
          being attended to by a female PARAMEDIC, who puts her arm
          around Lucy in a maternal gesture, shielding her from the
          sight of Emily as Emily did of the Sheridans.
                         
                          PARAMEDIC
           Don't look at her, okay? Just don't even
           look.
                         
          Lucy nods, the innocent victim. Clinging to her protector as
          she watches the ambulance take Emily Jennings away.

          INSTITUTIONAL PATIENTS watching tv in the psych hospital rec

          INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY
                         
          Emily talking agitatedly to a MAN IN A SUIT who is writing
          something and not paying attention to her. We only see her
          face at first.
                         
                          EMILY
           Where is she? Where'd they put her?
           Foster care? Is she with a family? You
           have to let me talk to them...
                         
          She snatches the pen from his hand.
                         
                          EMILY
           Do you hear me?!
                         
          He looks at her, quietly takes back his pen.
                         
           MAN IN SUIT
           I hear you.
                         
          Continues writing. There's a KNOCK on the door. A BAILIFF
          pokes his head in.
                         
                          BAILIFF
           Set.
                         
          Emily stands up from the chair she's been sitting in and we
          see she's wearing an ORANGE LA COUNTY JAIL JUMPSUIT. The
          man, her public defender, instructs her as they exit:
                         
           MAN IN SUIT
           Let me do the talking in here.
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE WOODED ROAD - DAY
                         
          Lucy walks a private road through sunlit forest with a kind
          RETIRED COUPLE. Temporary guardians who've taken her in for
          the weekend.
                         
                          LUCY
           Why can't I live with you?
                         
                          RETIRED WOMAN
           Oh, darling, we're not foster parents, we
           just help out when the system's full.
           111.
                         
                         
                          RETIRED MAN
           They'll contact us, Lucy, when your
           placement comes through.
                         
          The woman puts her arm around her as they walk on.
                         
                          RETIRED WOMAN
           Some nice family that always wanted a
           little girl.
                         
          Lucy smiles, shy, innocent, quietly taking in the scenery.
                         
          INT. FOSTER PLACEMENT SERVICES - NIGHT
                         
          Two women cross the office after hours, a pudgy middle-aged
          FOSTER CARE SUPERVISOR and a younger CASEWORKER who is
          leaving for the day. The office reminds you of Child
          Services, another tier of the child welfare system.
                         
                          CASEWORKER
           Going to the thing Saturday?
                         
                          SUPERVISOR
           I don't know.
                         
                          CASEWORKER
           Oh, you should. It'll be fun.
                         
                          SUPERVISOR
           Maybe I will, I don't know. We'll see.
                         
                          CASEWORKER
           Bye, Janey.
                         
                          SUPERVISOR
           See you tomorrow.
                         
          The Caseworker exits. The Supervisor comes down the row of
          cubicles dropping files on desks. Alone. After hours. A
          thankless profession.
                         
          It lands on some random desk, amid the usual backlog of mail
          and paperwork. A case file like all the others. The name
          typed on the label:
                         
          SHERIDAN, LUCY.
                         
           FADE OUT.

TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.
We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the
distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
Downtown Los Angeles skyline.
In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.
HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a
gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the
landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.
CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent
Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to
admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the
driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical
placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE
KEYHOLE into the foyer.

INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING
We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an
athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as
she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
side.

                     WOMAN
               (into phone)
          Yes Donna, I'm out the door.
We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the
kitchen, unable to see her face.

                     WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Just inform Kayleigh that
          anesthesia is on the way to prep
          the epidural and I'll be there as
          soon as I can.
Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently
straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
talks.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          And promise her she's about to have
          a woooonnderful labor.
As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her
HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.
They give each other a silent wave.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Right, I'll see you in twenty.
She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but
ready for the day ahead.

                     JESSICA
          Buenas dias, Rosario.



                      ROSARIO
           Good morning Miss Jessica.
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.
In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.

                 MALE VOICE
           (on machine)
           Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the-
And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--
SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts, noise and confusion.
Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.
Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --

                     LEAD GUNMAN
          Get away from there! Don't touch
          that -- !!
-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He
blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on
Jessica.

                 LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
          (dire)
          Where is he?
Jessica cringes.

                     JESSICA
          Where is who?

                     LEAD GUNMAN
          Wrong answer.
The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
face, knocking Jessica cold.
Then he turns to his men.

                     LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
          Search the house.
And as the answering machine fills the silence:

                CRAIG VO
          (on machine)
          -I'll call back later.
The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness
of his masked face.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:



EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY
The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.
We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:
An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its
destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is
dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.
As the van stops--

                                     WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:

INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE
A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--

THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER
Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid.
Imposing.

                     JESSICA
          Wh... what do you want?
Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...
Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.
Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.
Grim as death, he stalks toward her --

                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
          No, wait..
And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --

                     JESSICA (CONT'D)

          NO!   PLEASE--//
SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
hung there.
As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns
and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking
Jessica in the darkness.
Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to
show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--



                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
            Wha... what the hell is happening?!
The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE OCEAN
Skimming along the water.
And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern
California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA

PIER.

EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are
preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier.
VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.
BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.
HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.
FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.

INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING

ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.
The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer
generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.
Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:
RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the
beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal
reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi
Master of the game.
Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
screen.

                       RYAN
            You recording this?

                       CHAD (OS)
            Yeah, sure...
CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces
on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.
Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes
on the shoulder.



                       RYAN
            Move, bitch.
He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD."
Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.

                        KID
            Nice.
The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.

                        RYAN
            Get that?
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.

                       CHAD
            Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum
            Monster in Hi-Def videostream-

                      RYAN
            C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on
            that.
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the
cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".

                        CHAD
                 (through cup-holding
                  teeth)
            Sweet. It's going to my email
            right now.
S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
wipes it dry on his pants.

                       RYAN
            Watch it dude, I gotta return that
            thing in seven days.

                       CHAD
            They aren't giving you shit yet?

                       RYAN
            Nah, whenever I return it, I just
            list off why the phone sucks and
            they give me a new model. Figure
            by the tenth time I'll have to go
            somewhere else.
Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.

                                            CUT TO:

THE OCEAN
As seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in,
but it's still a forty foot drop.


RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
contemplating his last meal.

                      CHAD
           Go already. No one's looking.
His left hand holds his WALLET.

                 CHAD (CONT'D)
           (re: wallet)
           Need me to hold that?
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.

                     RYAN
          Waterproof.
But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left
leg starts trembling like crazy.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          This is stupid. I could get
          killed. Pick another dare.
Chad lowers the phone, irritated.

                     CHAD
          My ass. Not after you made me
          march in the Gay Pride Parade
          wearing a thong.

                     RYAN
          Screw it then. In one... Two...
          Two and a half--

                     CHAD
          Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts
snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to
the deck.

                    CHAD (CONT'D)
          Just so you know, I'm emailing this
          to every chick you ever met.
But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are
glued to something else--

                CHAD (CONT'D)
          (speaking like HAL 900)
          Transmitting pussy file now.
CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can
pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS
carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
"Heal The Bay" rally.
Ryan walks over like he owns the place.



                      RYAN
           Got any more? I'm here to help.

                      CHLOE
           Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.

                      RYAN
           What's in 'em?
Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           Cool, you're handing these out
           during the concert?

                     CHLOE
          Yeah, wanna help?
Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.

                       RYAN
          Hell yeah.     I'm all about "Heal the
          Bay. "
His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
          thing, of course...
An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,
pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so
Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          We've collected water samples with
          the Stream Team, raised money on
          the Promenade... I'm surprised I
          haven't seen you.
He offers his hand.

                       RYAN (CONT'D)
          Ryan.
She takes it.

                       CHLOE
          Chloe.
The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and
they both smile at each other. Chad splits.

                     CHLOE (CONT'D)
          I can't tell if you're full of it.
Ryan stops posturing, gets real.

                     RYAN
          You ever go up to Santa Barbara?
          My dad used to take me there all



                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           the time. Their pier is amazing,
           clear water, huge crabs everywhere,
           oysters right there on the rocks,
           starfish... Hard to believe it's
           the same ocean sometimes.
He's managed to win her back.

                     CHLOE
           Maybe you and I can take a break
           later when Pat Benatar goes on.

                      RYAN
           Sounds like a plan.
There's a moment...     Then --

                     CHLOE
          Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to
          pick up a box of T-shirts at the
          Kinkos on Venice.

                     RYAN
           I'll do it for you... if you want.

                    CHLOE
          Seriously, you would?

                       RYAN
          Sure.     How much is the bill?

                       CHLOE
          Nothing.    It's been paid up front.

                    RYAN
          Do you promise not to go anywhere?

                       CHLOE
          Done.
Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back.

                     RYAN
          Okay, I won't be long.

                CHLOE
          (laughing)
          Bye.
Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:

                    RYAN
          Dude, does Santa Barbara have a
          harbor or a pier?

                                                CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE - DAY
A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice
neighborhood.


Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn
across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now
sits on the shotgun seat.
Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.
Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,
and grabs the cellphone.

                      RYAN
                (into phone)
           Dex, wassup? You won't believe the
           hotties I just met at the pier.
           Smoking. You wanna meet them?
           Yeah? Well don't get too excited
           'cause I need my money.
Ryan stops at a red light.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           Bullshit, you're not going
           anywhere,
                (quickly adding)
           I'm pulling up right now.
Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening.
Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels
away angrily.

                    RYAN (CONT'D)
              (covering his ear)
          What? Yeah, you better be. And I
          need your shower, I'm talkin' code
          red stankage-
The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan
drives under an OVERPASS.
Suddenly --
The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan
notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car
skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before
hitting the other car's bumper.
He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED

WITH STATIC.

                RYAN (CONT'D)
          (into phone)
          Dex? You still there...?
And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.

                    RYAN (CONT'D)
          Damn.

EXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER                           10
As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass--


ID                                                                   iu





     SFX:   THE CELLPHONE RINGS.
     Ryan picks up the phone.

                           RYAN
                Sorry, got cut off.      Hey -- what's
                my Caller ID say?
     But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
                Yo Dex...?

                                                   MATCH CUT TO:

     ECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES
12   Their insulation picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG 12
     the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone,
     foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS,
     tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to
     simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:

                             RYAN (VO)
                Hello...?
     Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head
     slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a
     desperate hope filling her eyes.

                                                   CUT BACK TO:

13   INT. FORD BRONCO - CONTINUOUS                                   13
     With still no answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear --

                             RYAN
                Whatever.    Signing off-
     -- and is just about to hit END CALL when he hears a tiny
     female voice on the other end.

                            JESSICA (VO)
                Wait!    Don't hang up!
     Ryan puts the phone back to his ear.

                             RYAN
                Hello?

                           JESSICA (VO)
                There's not much time! I need you
                to go to the police. My name is
                Jessica Martin; I've been kidnapped!

                           RYAN
                     (not buying)
                Oh really? Kidnapped, huh?


13                                                                          j.j





                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Please. I know what you're
                  thinking, but it's real! I'm in an
                  attic somewhere. I think they're
                  going to kill me! You need to-

                             RYAN
                  Awfully polite kidnappers to give
                  you a phone...
     Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably.        Desperate, fearful
     and frustrated.

                              JESSICA (VO)
                  No!   You don't understand!
     Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear.          He pulls
     it away and looks at its faceplate.

14   INSERT SHOT - THE CELLPHONE                                            14

                  If you were really in trouble, you
                  would've called the cops, not me.
                  Now I've got a real call on the
                  other line--

     A WIDER SHOT so we see Jessica's bound hands. Her bruised
     face. Whispering frantically into the DEMOLISHED TELEPHONE
     she's JERI-RIGGING back together as she talks.

                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Goddamn it, listen to me! The
                  phone I'm on...it's shattered!
                  There's no dialer! I've been
                  clicking wires together for hours
                  trying to get someone, anyone, and
                  you 're the only connection I was

                  anyone else.

     SFX: Ryan's call waiting BLIPS again.        He considers
     everything Jessica has said, then:

                            RYAN
                  Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank
                  yanking someone else. Late.

     A TELEMARKETER checks Ryan's name on a list, then glances at
     the script.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Hello, Mr. Ackerman. My name is
                 Mark and I'd like to discuss with
                 you the benefits of Mastercharge
                 Credit Union's-

                           RYAN (VO)
                 Awesome, I can totally use a credit
                 card. Tell me more.

                               TELEMARKETER
                 Absolutely.     We've lowered our APR-

                           RYAN
                 -Shucks, now's really not a good
                 time, but why don't I get your
                 number and get back to you later.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Sure, it's 818...

                           RYAN
                 That's the office number?

                              TELEMARKETER
                 Yes.

                            RYAN
                 Why don't you give me your number
                 instead. That way I can call you
                 when you're having dinner with your
                 family.
     A beat.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Sorry to have bothered you.
     Click!    The Telemarketer hangs up.

                            RYAN
                 Damn skippy.
     And that's when he notices the message flashing on the
     phone's faceplate: CALL ON HOLD. Ryan clicks the FLASH
     button to pick it up...and Jessica is still there.



INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/JESSICA IN ATTIC                    19

                      JESSICA (VO)
           --an you hear me?!

                     RYAN
           You still there? You're getting
           kinda creepy, lady. See ya.

                       JESSICA
          No!    Don't! They're going to kill
          me!    They're going to kill me!!
A silent beat.   A calculated look in her eyes...
RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang
up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold.
On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY.

                    RYAN
          Oh, it's like that, huh?     Nice with
          the fake tears, lady...

                      JESSICA
          Please...   I just need help.
But Ryan won't be manipulated.

                    RYAN
          You need acting lessons. Now go take
          your meds and bug someone else.

                    JESSICA
          These men!!!--
Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in
her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at
the attic door, then continues, more in control.

                     JESSICA (CONT'D)
          These men killed my housekeeper.
          My dog. You have to help me.
Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this.

                    RYAN
          No, actually( I don't. Not with a
          hot chick waiting for me at the
          pier.

                      JESSICA
          Please...you're my only hope.
               (beat)
          What's your name?
That catches Ryan off-guard.   He stalls, not wanting to make
this personal.

                     RYAN
          Why, you writing a book--?


19                                                                  x?





                           JESSICA
                --Please, just tell me your name!
     Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone
     fountain outside a French Restaurant.

                           RYAN
                Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain.

                           JESSICA
                Johnny... What if it was your
                mother who was calling for help?
                How would you feel?

                           RYAN
                Well, I'd be damn impressed,
                considering she's dead.

                           JESSICA
                Goddamn it, how difficult is it to
                hand this phone off to the police?!
                I'll pay you!

                           RYAN
               How much?

                          JESSICA
               Five thousand dollars.

                          RYAN
               Sure you will. I'm hanging up now.

                          JESSICA
               No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's
               a eighty percent chance I'm lying,
               you nave a one in five chance to
               make five grand f9r a lousy twenty
               minutes of your life.
                    (panics as Ryan is silent)
               Haven't you ever bet on a horse or
               bought a Lottery ticket? I'm
               talking one-in-five odds, twenty
               minutes.
     Ryan slaps the radio off.

                          RYAN
               What do you want me to do?

     In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos unfolds around us like a

     OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams

     CLOSE UP:    BOB MOONEY'S EYES.    Concerned, but not panicked.
     MOONEY'S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with
     a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall,
     legal but hard.
     SFX:   A HEARTBEAT.    OURS.    FAST... And possibly IRREGULAR?
     CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the

     LEFT WRIST.
     MOONEY'S EYES.      Watching.   Counting... Suddenly --
     WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed
     into the station desk by a ROOKIE.

                            ROOKIE OFFICER
                 Problem, Mooney. If I put this one
                 in with the others, there's gonna
                 be a bloodbath.

                            GANGBANGER
                 Put me in there! I'll waste all
                 them pussies!
     REVEAL SERGEANT BOB MOONEY -- a tough, fifty-something beat
     cop who's fighting growing old every step of the way. He
     rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of PIZZA.

                            MOONEY
                 Come on Powell, put the Sharks with
                 the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets
                 and make room.
     Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the
     Gangbanger back over to the holding cells.
     Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the
     news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner.

21   ON THE TELEVISION                                                 21
     a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him,
     FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court;
     being led away in handcuffs.

                            NEWS REPORTER
                 ...was somber when the indictments
                 came down this afternoon in the
                 23rd Precinct corruption scandal.
                 Though the names of six police
                 officers were read aloud, the
                 District Attorney stated that this
                 was merely the "tip of the iceberg"
                 and that unfortunately many other
                 arrests are likely to be coming as
                 the investigations proceed.



'2    BACK TO POLICE STATION                                      22
     As DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN passes Mooney, he nods toward the TV.

                           DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                Sucks for the fellas at the Two-
                Three right now, huh?

                          MOONEY
                Dirty pricks deserve what they get.
                Public hates us enough without this
                shit.

                      DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                (leaving)
                There's good men over there.
     A FEMALE OFFICER passes Mooney and reaches for his box of
     pizza.

                          FEMALE OFFICER
               Mooney? What are you doing?      You can't
               be eating this crap.
     Mooney plants his own firm grip on the box.

                         MOONEY
               Keep walking, Shelly.   Nothing to
               see here.
     A friendly tug of war.

                          FEMALE OFFICER
               You sure you wanna do that?     What
               would your wife say?
     That's it. Mooney snatches his lunch back and turns to
     lecture this little girl.

                          MOONEY
               She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not
               gonna know about it! Christ, Shel,
               my old man had eleven heart
               attacks. Eleven! I have one
               little infarction and you guys
               start treating me like an invalid!
               I'm a grown man! Leave me alone,
               will you?!

                          FEMALE OFFICER
                    (abashed)
               I was merely referring to your
               cottage-cheese ass.
     Mooney sighs and lifts his pizza to his mouth when --
     WHAMM! The station doors burst open and two dozen GANG
     MEMBERS are bum-rushed into the room by a squad of COPS in
     riot gear. The screaming is deafening.



                                                               17.

                           MOONEY
                I hate this place.

                                               CUT TO:

23   EXT. 15TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS                                 23
     The Ford Bronco roars up; snags the handicapped spot. Ryan
     hops out and limps theatrically the first few steps until
     he's far enough away from the car to start running.

                          RYAN
                    (into phone)
               I'm here.

24   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS                                 24
     Cops try to wrangle the dozens of shouting GANG MEMBERS who
     cram the Station Desk, waiting to be booked.
     Ryan takes a deep breath and shoves his way through the
     mayhem to the extremely shorthanded Station Desk where:

     MOONEY
     is busy doing ten things at once. Signing release papers.
     Booking a DRUNK whose wife-beater Tee is drenched in blood,
     Etc.

                         RYAN
               Excuse me, officer --
     But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that
     suddenly need arrest sheets signed.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               Hey, I've got an emergency here --
     Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a
     cuffed CRACKHEAD TRANNIE in tow. The Trannie's wrists ache.

                          CRACKHEAD TRANNIE
               Loosen these, man, please?! Jus'
               gimme a chance--

                         CREWCUT OFFICER
               Hey, Moon! Where do you want me to
               put Whitney Houston?

                          MOONEY
               Christ, I've only got two hands here!
               Stick him in the can, will ya?
     Crewcut nods and moves off towards the bathroom.

                          RYAN
                    (shoving forward)
               Come on, man! I've got some lady
               on the phone here who says she's
               been kidnapped!

     Ryan holds up the phone.         Mooney looks around.

                           MOONEY
                Nice try, kid, but I got no time
                for pranks.

                           RYAN
                Seriously, a lady was murdered!

                          MOONEY
                Which is it, a kidnapping or a
                murder?

                           RYAN
                Take the phone and find out moron!
     A COP snickers somewhere.

     Jessica holds her breath. She stares apprehensively at the
     attic door, praying for Mooney to just take the damn phone.

                             JESSICA
               Please. . .

     Ryan looks sincere.     Mooney deliberates, then sighs.

                           MOONEY
               Okay.   Give it here.
     Ryan thrusts the phone at him, happy to get rid of it.

                          JESSICA (VO)
                    (barely audible whisper)
               Oh thank God! You've got to help
               me. My name's Jessica Martin and
               I've been kidnapped. This morning
               five men broke into my home in
               Brentwood and kidnapped--
     Mooney strains to hear.     His eyes go wide and he quickly jots
     notes on a pad.
     Mooney's eyes shift as three TWEAKERS, wide eyed and sweating
     profusely, are led inside by their ARRESTING OFFICERS.

                             MOONEY
               Ah shit.
     Mooney holds out the phone.

                          MOONEY (CONT'D)
               Hurry kid, take this upstairs to
               Robbery/Homicide and ask for
               Detective Tomlin.



                                                              19.

     Ryan reluctantly takes the phone back as more people converge
     on the Station Desk.

27   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          27
     Jessica hears the phone being shuffled around.

                             RYAN (VO)
                Where?

28   BACK TO POLICE STATION                                          28
     Mooney, recognizing an emergency when he hears one, ignores
     the incoming CROWD him long enough to assist Ryan.

                          MOONEY
               Up the stairs, Tomlin!
     Ryan turns away, and as he returns the cellphone to his ear,
     he's startled to hear--

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (terrified)
               Oh my God...

     SFX: FOOTSTEPS.     RIGHT OUTSIDE HER DOOR.

                          RYAN (VO)
               Lady, what's going on?!
     Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it
     behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and
     two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her,
     they stand silently, trying to unnerve her.

                         LEAD KIDNAPPER
               Where's your husband?

                            JESSICA
               What?     I don't-
     The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica
     wants to collapse to the ground, but remains sitting TO KEEP
     THE PHONE HIDDEN behind her.
     The Leader bends down and yells right in her face.



                                                                     20.

      SLAP!!!   This one's even nastier than the first.

      Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs
      for the station stairwell.

                 Please, he should be at work!
                 That's all I know.
      The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with
      relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is
      short-lived as:

                My son --
     Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts
     breaking up the call.

               It's just static. I'm running
               upstairs to the detectives. Hold
               on, I might lose you for a sec--

                    (realizing)
               No, don't! Stop. You can't lose

                    (still running)
               Wait, we're almost there.

               Stop! Johnny, goddamn it, stop!

               STOP! IF YOU LOSE ME, I'M DEAD!!
     Hearing her fearful tone, Ryan stops reluctantly.

                         RYAN
               Well, what the hell am I supposed
               to do?!
     Ryan looks at himself, standing on the stairs like an idiot.

                           RYAN (CONT'D)
               Jesus!   I'm almost there!
     Ryan checks the SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR on the phone.
     There's only one bar left. Defiantly, Ryan takes a step
     UP...and the bar DISAPPEARS. He quickly hops BACK DOWN.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
               Crap!
                    (shouts up stairs)

               HELLO? DETECTIVE TOMLIN! WILL

               SOMEONE GET TOMLIN FOR ME, PLEASE?!
     There's no response.   Ryan can't believe this.

                (yells upstairs)

                IS ANYONE UP THERE?!
     Jessica calms herself, resolving to save her child's life.

                          JESSICA
                Johnny, listen to me. My son's
                school lets out at 1:45.

                          RYAN
                Good, then if I get a cop--
     Ryan exits the stairwell to find Mooney -- but Mooney's not
     there anymore! There's some NEW GUY -- and he's SWAMPED!

                         JESSICA
                No. There's not enough time. You
                have to pick him up before they--

                          RYAN
               Pick him up? Hell no, lady!     I
               ain't goin' nowhere else--
     Ryan tries to get the NEW GUY's attention, in a dream.

                          JESSICA
               Please please stop standing there!
               He 's just a little boy!

                          RYAN
               But I'm in a police station!

                          JESSICA
               Go!
     Ryan grunts in frustration.

                                                   SMASH CUT TO:

33   EXT. 15TH PRECINCT - MOMENTS LATER                                   33
     ECU - THE FORD BRONCO'S TIRES -- Burning rubber...

                                                   CUT TO:

34   INT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - LIVING ROOM             34
     The furniture in this abandoned house is all covered with
     sheets giving the entire place a creepy, haunted feel.
     FOLLOW the LEAD KIDNAPPER as he descends a nearby stairwell
     and pulls off his mask--

     REVEAL GREER
     Forties, salt and pepper hair.    He looks to his crew:

     THE KIDNAPPERS



                                                                 23.

34                                                                     34




     They're all trim. Athletic. In good shape. They're
     UNMASKED, watching the TV with interest. The news on the
     corruption scandal.
     Greer snaps the TV off.     Checks his watch and nods grimly.

                          GREEK
               Go get the kid.
     Instantly, a hulk of a man (DEASON) and an arrogant, red-
     headed prick (ELLIS) stand and exit the house.
     As Greer stalks away( BOOM DOWN the bar to REVEAL a telephone
     sitting there, unnoticed by the men -- and on its face, the
     LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR LIGHT is lit.
     PUSH IN on the flashing orange light that threatens to give
     Ryan and Jessica's call away. Closer and closer, until we
     ENTER the phone and TRAVEL THROUGH THE WIRES to --

35   A MATCHING LIGHT ON RYAN'S CELLPHONE                              35
     As we PULL BACK we see that we're in the Ford Bronco, racing
     through:

36   EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY                                           36
     Ryan guns the engine as Jessica panics on the other end of
     the phone. We can hear her hyperventilating.

               Where are you now?!

                          RYAN
               I just got off the 405.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               You've got to go faster, Johnny!

                          RYAN
               You've gotta chill! You're
               stressing the crap out of me!
                   (looking around)
               Where the hell is a cop hiding in a
               speed trap when you need one?
     Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.    Pushing it against
     his better judgment.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
               What do these guys want, anyway?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               How should I know?!

                          RYAN
               What do you do?

                          JESSICA
               I'm an obstetrician. They don't
               want anything from me.



                                                                  24.

36                                                                      36


     Ryan slaloms around other cars like a racecar driver.

                          RYAN
                So your husband's like, uber-rich?

                          JESSICA (VO)
                What--? No. He's an accountant.
                I make more money than he does.

                           RYAN
                Could they've mistaken you for
                someone else?

                           JESSICA
                No! I don't know.    None of this
                makes any sense.
     Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much
     that he takes the next corner too fast and -- SKKRRASH! --

37   EXT. ROAD CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS                                37
     The BRONCO EXPLODES through an orange-and-white "ROAD CLOSED"

     CONSTRUCTION BARRIER!
     And dead ahead is a CONSTRUCTION CREW resurfacing the road!

                          RYAN
               Oh...SHIT!!
     Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group
     of workers -- and OBLITERATES THE BRONCO'S PASSENGER SIDE
     MIRROR against another BARRIER --
     Ryan cringes with every muscle!
     And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes
     through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend!

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
               (smirking)
               ...Ain't that a bitch.
     As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit
     out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet
     asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away,
     CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER.
     More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and --

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               There's the school.
     Ryan's right.   Just ahead, we see:

38   EXT. THE WYMAN SCHOOL - DAY                                        38


        private prep school for boys. Ryan pull: A private prep
       it. Walks quickly toward the building.    school for
                                                 boys. Ryan
     pulls over and hops
     out,





                                                                  25.

38                                                                      38





                           RYAN
                Okay, I'm here.

                           JESSICA (VO)
                How much time do we have?
     Ryan checks his watch.     It reads:   "1:40 PM".   He enters.

                          RYAN
               Five minutes. What's your kid's name?

                            JESSICA (VO)
               Ricky.

                          RYAN
               Ricky what?

                            JESSICA
               Martin.

                          RYAN
               Ricky Martin? You named your kid
               Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you
               tattoo "kick me" on his ass while
               you were at it?

                         JESSICA
               He was named before the singer ever-

                            RYAN
               Forget it.     What does he look like?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               He's eight years old. Blonde hair.
               Green eyes. Small for his age.
               He's wearing a light blue shirt and
               dark blue pants--

                         RYAN
               They're all wearing blue shirts and
               pants!
     Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right.      It's
     filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS.
     As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him
     and wheels him around.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               Ricky Martin?
     The Boy's eyes get huge.     He tries to pull away.

                          TIMID BOY
               Don't touch me!

                          RYAN
               No, kid, it's okay!    I didn't mean
               to--



                                                                26.

38                                                                    38





                            TIMID BOY
                Help!   Don't touch me!   Don't touch!!
     Ryan quickly moves on... aware that other ADULTS are now
     beginning to take notice of him.

                          RYAN (INTO PHONE)
                Does he have anything else? A
                jacket? A backpack? What's his
                lunch box look like?

                           JESSICA (VO)
                I don't remember.

                           RYAN
                You don't remember your own kid's
                lunch box?!

                          JESSICA
               I don't pack it! Rosario, our
               housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig,
               but...
     Jessica begins to sob, which causes Ryan to panic further.

                          RYAN
               Ricky Martin, where are you!?
     None of the Stepford kids respond.

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (through tears)
               I wish I could give you more.
     Now Ryan's running.    He yells into a BATHROOM.

                         RYAN
               Ricky Martin?

                         MALE VOICE (OS)
               Can I help you, sir?
     Ryan turns to see a MUSCULAR GYM TEACHER looming there.
     Clearly, the guy thinks Ryan's peeping into the boys' room.

                          RYAN
               I'm looking for a little blond boy--
                    (off his shocked look)
               --No, no! Not like that!

                          GYM TEACHER
               Sir, come with me, please!
     Ryan isn't going anywhere. And that's when the BELL RINGS.
     Like a nightmare, HUNDREDS OF UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS come
     racing out of their classes.

                            RYAN
               Oh shit...



                                                                27.

38                                                                    38


     As the boys stampede by, Ryan yanks the WHISTLE from around
     the Gym Teacher's thick neck and starts blowing it like
     crazy.

                           GYM TEACHER

               HEY--11

                           RYAN

               RICKY MARTIN! DOES ANYONE KNOW
               WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't
               believe I'm yelling this at an all-
               boys school.
     All hell is breaking loose. The kids ignore him. The huge
     Gym Teacher races after him. Jessica yells in his ear.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               Was that the bell? Was that the
               bell?!

                            RYAN
               Yes.    RICKY! RICKY MARTIN!!
     Ryan wades through the sea of uniforms.

                         JESSICA (VO)
               He'11 go to the parents' pick-up
               spot. Oh God, they're going to get
               him!

"\
     Ryan turns around and starts bulling through.    The Gym
     Teacher violently grabs his arm and yanks--

                          GYM TEACHER
               Where do you think you're going?
     --causing the phone to fly out of Ryan's hand and --crack!--
     hit the pavement.

                           RYAN
               No--!
     Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone.   The LCD
     display GLASS is cracked into a SPIDERWEB.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
               (desperate into phone)
               Jessica? You still there?!

                           JESSICA (VO)
               Yes?
     Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school.

                          RYAN
               No one's gonna get your kid!    He's
               not slow, is he?

                           JESSICA (VO)
               What--?   No!



                                                                28.

38                                                                    38





                          RYAN
               Then he won't go anywhere with
               strangers.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11
               think it's Rosario and hop right in!
     She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the
     pick-up spot. Scans the lot.

                         RYAN
               What color?

                          JESSICA
               Black!

                     RYAN
               (looks)
               Of course it is.
     PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac
     Escalades.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               There's three of them.    What's your
               plate?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I
               don't remember!

                         RYAN
               Like you don't remember the lunch
               box? Or anything else about your
               kid--
                    (stops, realizing)
               Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't
               it?

                         JESSICA (VO)
               No!

                         RYAN
               Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady.
               Your friends too. Getting me to
               scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys
               school. Damn, you really nailed
               me.

                         JESSICA (VO)
               No--


               This is great, the police think I'm
               a whack job. The school thinks I'm
               some kind of perv child molester.
               I'll probably get the Herpes from
               the gym teacher's whistle --

     But Ryan's had enough.     He turns to leave --

                          RYAN
               I'm done being your entertainment for
               the day. I'm going back to the pier
               while I still have a chance --
     -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT-
     YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan
     hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides
     "screw it", and keeps on hoofing.
     Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym
     Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD.

                          GYM TEACHER
               Here he is! He's the one that's
               been stalking the students.

                            RYAN
               Stalking?!     No, I can explain--
     The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.

                          RENT-A-COP #1
               Okay, we got him. We're at the
               front of the school.
                    (then, to Ryan)
               Sir, come with us.

                         RYAN
                   (as they grab him)
               Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a
               sec! This is a huuuge
               misunderstanding--
     A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls
     up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly
     leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--

                          JESSICA (VO)
                    (interrupting)
               Lord of the Rings! I forgot his
               father bought him a Lord of the
               Rings lunchbox last week!
     Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy
     with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school
     steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades.

                         RYAN
                   (struggling)

               RICKY MARTIN!!
     The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name
     called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan lock eyes--





                                                        [CONTINUED)

         --and that's when a HAND reaches out, snags his backpack and
         YANKS Ricky into the dark of the car! Instantly, the door
         slams shut and the Escalade begins to take off.
         WHIP PAN to Ryan's shocked reaction. He's the only one who's
         seen it. He tries to struggle free of the Guard.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh shit!    You just see that?!
         Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner
         in the car.

                               RENT-A-COP #1
                    Roy, some help over here!
         Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway.

                              RYAN
                        (struggling harder)
                   Goddamn it, that little kid was
                   just kidnapped!! Do something!!

                                RENT-A-COP #1
                   Roy--! !
         The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but
         as he gets near -- Ryan breaks free!

                                RENT-A-COPS

                   HEY--! !
         They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the
         idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its driver's
         seat.
         Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs
         Ryan's collar -- and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws
         the little car in gear and burns away.

39       INT. RENT-A-COP CAR - RACING DOWN A RESIDENTIAL STREET           39

         feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he
         slaloms through the streets of East Hollywood.

         There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade.

                   It's okay, I can see them ahead.

     back sits Jessica's son, RICKY; who eyes the two men
     suspiciously. CCR plays on the RADIO.
      Ellis, turns down the radio.       Faking sincerity, he turns to
      face Ricky.

                             ELLIS
                       (gesturing to the radio)
                  Do you want me to change the
                  station to something else?
     Ricky refuses to answer.        Ellis turns around, his fake smile
     quickly vanishing.

                              ELLIS (CONT'D)
                  Yeah.   I like Creedence too.
     He's about to turn the radio volume up when --

                             RICKY
                  Where's Rosario?

                             ELLIS
                  I told you, kid, she had a doctor's
                  appointment, so your mother asked
                  us to pick you up. Don't worry,
                  you'll see your mommy in a few
                  minutes.
     Ricky nods... but we can tell by the look on his face that
     he's not buying their story one bit.

     Cautiously, so as not to give himself away, Ryan PASSES one
     commuter car. Then the next. Narrowing the gap between the
     rent-a-cop car and the Escalade to one last auto.
     It takes Ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up
     enough speed to get around the final car. Now the Escalade
     is dead ahead. Ryan begins gently closing the distance
     between them, and is just starting to relax, when--

     A CITY BUS
     merges into traffic from a Bus Stop right ahead of him!



                                                                  32.

                 SHIT!
       Ryan SLAMS on his breaks and is forced to crawl along at a
 ainful 25 m.p.h.. Worse, he has his view of the Escalade
glocked by the bus' titanic silver ass.

      Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of
      the Escalade still ahead.

                (taps his horn)
                Come on!
      But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the
      security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the
      hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)

                Can't you go around it?
      There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic--
      But suddenly there's    a break in the  flow! Seizing the
      moment, Ryan SLAM-SH   IFTS the rent-a -cop car's uni-cylinder
      engine into gear and    starts to tear  around the bus -- but has
      to SWERVE BACK as a    SPEEDING TRASH  TRUCK rounds a bend and
      almost creams him!

                           RYAN

                     (irritated)
                That's nice.
     Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over.

                           RYAN (CONT'D)
                Hey, here we go!

     As the bus pulls aside, Ryan floors the wanna-be cop car
     around it...but directly in front of him is a HOMELESS MAN,
     dressed like a sheik, dragging his caravan of TWO COVERED

     SHOPPING CARTS.

     heads straight    for a the FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW of a CAR

     center aisle. CAR SALESMEN and PATRONS are forced to dive
     out of the way as the rent-a-cop car MOWS DOWN DISPLAYS and
     everything else in its path.

     Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade

               to see you this morning. Had some
               rap about a kidnapping --

                         DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask
               around. Kidnapping, huh?

                          MOONEY
               I thought it was a prank at first,
               but the kid was so worked up--

                          DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               Well, don't you get worked up.
                    (slaps Mooney's chest)
               If the kid comes back, page me, and
               I'll be sure to see him.

                          MOONEY
                    (swallowing his pride)
               Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks.
     And as Tomlin walks off --

                                              CUT TO:

     Ryan lead-foots the gas. The speedometer climbs.   Forty.
     Fifty. Sixty miles an hour.

                         JESSICA (VO)
               Look, Johnny, you've got to go back
               to the cops--



                                                                        36.

                            RYAN
                 Are you high?! I just jacked a car!

                            JESSICA (VO)
                 Goddamn it, stop thinking about
                 just yourself! You can explain
                 everything to them later!

     SUDDENLY -- SFX: RYAN'S PHONE BEGINS BEEPING.



                              RYAN
                 What now?
     Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out.

     INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE
     The BATTERY INDICATOR is flashing:         LOW BATT.   LOW BATT.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
                 Great!   Now the battery's dying.

                           JESSICA
                Don't you have a charger?

                           RYAN
                It's in my car!      Hold on.
     SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!    The battery indicator has lost another bar.
     Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens
     the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out.

                              RYAN (CONT'D)
                Jesus -- !

                           JESSICA
                What's going on? Did you find one?

                           RYAN
                     (staring at the gun)
                Not exactly...
     SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!!     Jessica starts growing afraid.

                           JESSICA
                Johnny, don't lose me!

                          RYAN
                Well what the hell do you expect me
                to do?!
     Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED
     to a halt ahead. He tries to maneuver around it, but is
     almost immediately boxed in.

     SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!

                              JESSICA
                Johnny--!



                                                              37.

                            RYAN
                 I know, Jessica!
     The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And
     traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately.
     Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop
     down a HILL to a strip mall below--
     STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of
     the store's signs: "VERIZON WIRELESS".
     Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter-
     mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it
     there.

     SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP...'.'
     Ryan's got to do something.      Now.

                            RYAN (CONT'D)
                 You know that money you promised me?

                            JESSICA (VO)
                 Yes.

                            RYAN
                 I'm giving myself a raise.

47   EXT. VERIZON MALL HILL - CONTINUOUS                             47
     And with that, Ryan CRANKS the steering wheel hard right and
     HITS THE GAS!   Despite other drivers' protests, the little
     Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through
     the rusty GUARD RAIL and -- VROOOOM! -- flies off the side of
     the hill!
     Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear
     blue sky.

                          RYAN

                HOOOOLLYYY SHIIII--
     THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope.
     Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile,
     miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE STUMPS.
     He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its
     antenna in his teeth.
     There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly
     hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan HYPERVENTILATING.

                           JESSICA (VO)
                What's going on?!

                           RYAN
                     (with phone in teeth)
                mmmrrmph mrm mrmph!
     Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until
     the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two
     wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings



                                                               38.

     it back down -- SLAMM! -- so hard that the phone goes flying
     across the car!

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
                Shit!
     Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he
     bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!

                             RYAN (CONT'D)

                WHOAAAAAA!
     Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the
     billboard's concrete posts, but -- WHAM! -- obliterates the
     rent-a-cop's BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard's lower edge.
     Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the
     rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where
     it SKIDS OUT.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
                (grabbing phone)
                Jessica?! Can you hear me?!

                             JESSICA (VO)
                I'm here!
     Ryan hops out and races inside--

48   THE VERIZON WIRELESS STORE - CONTINUOUS                         48
     And of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed.
     Every SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy.

     SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!
     Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter --

                           IRATE CUSTOMERS
                Hey, what do you think you're
                doing? There's a line!
     -- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else.

                           OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN
                ..and if you get the new Nokia

                Are you feeling fierce?
     The salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand.

                           EASILY-EXCITABLE CUSTOMER
                Oh, how fun!

                         RYAN
                Excuse me--

                           OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN
                I'm sorry, sir, I'm with a customer

                  But if you take a number, someone
                  will be with you shortly.
       Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with
       tickets ejected from the mouth. The next ticket it offers is
       "#97"...and the Now-Serving Display on the wall reads "#71".

       SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!I
       Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by.     Ryan grabs her.

                               RYAN
                  Hey! Hey!      I've got an emergency
                  here --

                             RYAN
                  Damn it, will you listen to me?!
                  I've got a life and death call on
                  this phone and my battery's dying!
                  Do you have a charger?

                             BUSY SALESMAN
                  Sure.
                       (walks away)
                  Take a number and one of the sales
                  associates will grab you one when
                  your turn comes up.

       SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!
       Ryan breaks out in a cold sweat. Can't catch his breath. As
       a SALESWOMAN rushes by, Ryan reaches for her.

                               RYAN (CONT'D)
                  Help, I --

                  Take a number.
       The room starts spinning around him. It's clear no one's
       going to help him. Like the clap of doom, the NOW-SERVING
       DISPLAY on the wall flips happily to "#72"

       SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!


       Frantic, Ryan glances at the phone. And just as the last
       BATTERY BAR on the power indicator FLICKERS and DISAPPEARS --

                             RYAN
                  Aw, screw this...
       -- Ryan pulls the rent-a-cop's big .38 SPECIAL from his
       pocket and BLOWS THE SMILEY FACE DISPENSER TO DUST!

     Mooney exits the mayhem of the s   tation and walks to a SQUAD
     CAR. Gets in. As he pulls his      seatbelt on, something
     CRINKLES in his breast pocket.     He pulls it out -- the SCRAP
     OF PAPER where the scribbled the    words "JESSICA MARTIN" and
     "BRENTWOOD" when Ryan handed him    the phone.
     Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but
     stops himself. He stares at the words, then unable to let it
     go, punches keys on the MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. A name and
     address appear on the screen:

     JESSICA KATE MARTIN.   327 ELMWOOD ESTATES, BRENTWOOD.


     Mooney stares at the name. Then, after a moment, he sighs
     and pulls a LA LAKERS cellphone from his coat. Dials.

               Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm gonna be a

     Greer's question still hangs in the air.

                           JESSICA
               N-no...
     Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another
     direction from the phone that lies OUT IN THE OPEN.

                          JESSICA (CONT'D)
                ...but I am going to, aren't I?

                          GREER
               Up to you. Your husband left a
               message asking you to meet him in
               left field. Where's that?

               What?   I don't understand--?
     Greer winds up and BAM! Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking
     the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground.

               wouldn't leave a message that
               didn't make sense to you!
     Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again--

                          JESSICA
               Wait! The bleachers behind left
               field at Dodger Stadium! That's
               where we first met.

      Greer stares at Jessica for a long uncomfortable moment,
      searching her soul. She's lying.

                             JESSICA (CONT'D)
                  Please! Believe me. That has to
                  be where he means. I swear to God.
     Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long
     enough for Jessica to NUDGE the phone back behind the beam!

                            GREER
                  Working in my profession as long as
                  I have, you begin to recognize the
                  truth when you hear it.
     Jessica, trembling, hangs on Greer's every word.

                      (turning back)
                  Go to the window, Jessica. There's
                  something I want you to see.
     Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to
     the attic window -- and GASPS.

55   JESSICA'S POV - THE YARD BELOW                                    55
     Down in the yard below, Jessica's eleven-year-old son Ricky
     stands uncomfortably in the middle of a basketball half-court
     as one of the kidnappers (a severe-looking ex-con named
     HODGES) stands nearby, watching.

     Hodges looks up and sees Jessica's face in the window.   Then
     turns and tosses a basketball to Ricky.

                             HODGES
                  Shoot hoops.

                       (threatening)
                  Shoot.
     Nervously, Ricky begins to bounce the ball.

     Jessica sees her son start shooting the ball -- completely
     oblivious to Hodges, who flicks open his coat, revealing
     SILENCED PISTOL tucked into his waistband.

     Down below, Ricky shoots baskets, unaware of Hodges closing
     his hand around his gun.

     Frantic, Jessica locks eyes with Hodges, silently pleading
     for him not to do this. Hodges stares back with glacial ice.

                    (welling up with tears)
               Do you think I like gambling with
               my son's life?

                         RYAN
               I can't tell. You seem pretty good
               at it --

                         JESSICA
               Don't you see, Ryan? Once they get
               Craig, we're all gonna die.

                          RYAN
               You can't know that for sure.

                          JESSICA
               Be realistic. Does letting us live
               benefit them in any way? No! The
               only chance he's got is if you can
               get to the airport and find him
               before they do.

                         RYAN

               It's suicide. They'll kill me!

                They won't! You're invisible to
                them! They don't know who you are.
                They don't know anything about you.
                Please! You've got to try!

                Lady, I've jacked two cars, been
                accused of being a child molester,
                obliterated a car dealership, and
                busted three caps in a Verizon
                store. -- Don't tell me I'm not
                trying!
     Jessica tries another tack.

                          JESSICA
               Look, I have no right to ask you
               this Ryan, but you re my family's
               only chance...and I am asking.
     Something in the way she says that last sentence, a mixture
     of strength and vulnerability, gets through to Ryan.
     And against his own will, he's swayed.

                          RYAN
                    (gives in)
               I'll get the phone to your husband,

     Ryan, heading toward the airport, floors the gas.

                                               CUT TO:

78   EXT. BRENTWOOD   NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY                               78
     A PATROL CAR prowls down a quaint residential block. Comes
     to a stop in the driveway of what we know to be Jessica
     Martin's house. Mooney gets out. Knocks.
     The door opens, revealing the ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN from
     before.

                         MOONEY
               Ms. Martin?

                          ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
               Yes?

                          MOONEY
               Jessica Kate Martin?
     The Woman nods. Mooney is plainly disillusioned by the
     woman. Maybe his hunch was wrong...

                          ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
               Cam I help you, Officer...?
     She scans Mooney's badge.



                                                                   50.

                           MOONEY
                Mooney.
                     (shakes his head)
                No. No, I guess not. Must've been
                a prank. I m sorry to have
                b9thered you, Ms. Martin. Have a
                nice day.
     The Woman smiles and nods, and Mooney walks off. When he
     gets to his car, he CRUMPLES the paper with Jessica's name
     and address, and shakes his head, chuckling at himself.
     As Mooney drives off--

     THE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
     walks back into the house and flips open her CELLPHONE. When
     she finishes dialing, a familiar DEEP MALE VOICE answers.

                            DEEP MALE VOICE (VO)

                          ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)
                An Officer Mooney from your
                division. Know him?
     Now, we start PULLING BACK, revealing the man's features.

                          DEEP MALE VOICE
                Mooney? He's a desk sergeant.      What
                would you want with him?

               I had to do a B & E and he came
               snooping around the house looking
               for the owner.

                          DEEP MALE VOICE
               And what did you say?

                         ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)
               That I was her, of course.
     Continue PULLING BACK.   We can almost recognize him now...

                         DEEP MALE VOICE
               Did he believe you?

                         ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN   (VO)
               I think so. He said he thought
               someone was pulling a prank on him.

                          DEEP MALE VOICE
               Mooney doing an investigation?
               What's are you really up to?
     The man swivels around in his chair and we see clearly it's--

                          DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               And no bullshit. Right now you're

     Jessica's voice trails off as she catches a glimp se of
     herself in an OLD MIRROR standing in the corner.  Bruised.
     Clothes torn. Staring at her own cracked reflect  ion, she
     breaks down, but silently this time, locked in he r own
     personal hell.
     For Ryan, the silence is deafening. Despite his frantic
     driving, he feels her pain. And hates being unable to help.

                          RYAN
               Jessica... ?
     There's an emotional beat, then--

                          JESSICA
               Do you think God will forgive me?

                          RYAN

               For what I've done...   For giving
               up Craig...
     Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice.

                          RYAN
               Jessica, they have your kid. You
               had no choice.

                          JESSICA
               I don't know. I don't know...

                         RYAN
               1 know. I heard what they were
               doing to you over there. You held
               out for as long as you could.

               Ryan. They already have us. But
               maybe I could've saved Craig...
     The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan. And just
     when Jessica is about to lose herself to despair --
     Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he
     had.

                          RYAN
               Jessica, listen to me. I promise
               you, I'm not going to let that

     There is a moment between them, two people connecting on a

     But the moment is suddenly cut short as a STATICKY VOICE
     start bleeding into their phone call -- some BRITISH ASSHOLE
     having his own phone call.

               Look woman, tell your kidnapping
               story to someone who gives a shit.
     Ryan can't hear Jessica's side of the conversation; only the
     British Asshole's, which comes in loud and clear.

                             RYAN
               Jessica?!     Jessica?!
     As Ryan goes mental, a CAR PASSES HIM on the opp9site side of
     the road -- a new Cadillac XLR convertible! Inside is an
     appropriately asshole-ish looking guy. He could only be the
     British Asshole.

                 Gotcha.
     Ryan pulls a HARROWING 180 DEGREE TURN, barely missing an
     oncoming car by inches.
     He RACES up to the Cadillac, which has a VANITY PLATE that
     reads, "IDOL MKR." Ryan looks through the window at --

     to be none other than SIMON COWELL, host of American Idol.
     Simon continues his spittle-spraying rant -- at no one.      It
     appears he's using the car's SPEAKERPHONE.

     Ryan sees Simon Cowell MOUTH THE WORDS "STUPID COW" in synch
     with the conversation. BINGO!
     Ryan floors the Rent-a-cop car ahead of the Cadillac and
     PULLS A 90 DEGREE turn at an intersection; cutting Cowell
     off!
     SCREEEECH! Cowell, trying to avoid a collision, SLAMS on the
     brakes, causing the Cadillac to SKID twenty feet.
     Ryan jumps out of the rent-a-cop car he's left in the middle
     or the intersection and runs over to the Cadillac, banging on
     the window with the .38 Special.
     Cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the
     gun and the kid with the crazy look in his eyes.

84   THE RENT-A-COP CAR                                              84
     EXPLODES into tiny pieces of junk as the semi PLOUGHS THROUGH
     IT! Flaming debris rains down around Ryan, and he covers his
     mouth, unable to believe his shitty luck.

                           RYAN
                Ain't that a bitch!
     Ryan turns back to Simon Cowell.

                           RYAN (CONT'D)
                Out of the car! Now!
     Cowell all but dives out.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
               Where's your phone?!

                           SIMON COWELL
                It's on speaker!
     Ryan turns to the car.    Calls out.

                           RYAN
               Jessica?

                            JESSICA (VO)
               Ryan?!    I'm here!
     Her voice says she can't believe her ears.
     Relieved, Ryan jumps in the Cadillac XLR and tosses his phone
     on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the
     engine and STOMPS the gas.
     As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just
     enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of
     Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away.
     Practically frothing at the mouth, Simon Cowell chases after
     on foot, cursing as his beautiful new Cadillac disappears in
     the distance --

                           SIMON COWELL
               Your career's over!    YOU HEAR ME?!

               OVER!

85   INT. CADILLAC XLR                                               85
     As Jessica's voice RESOUNDS around him, he notices the
     phone's controlled through the radio. He turns it up.

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (still shaken)
               I thought they... I thought I was--



                                                                     56.

                               RYAN
                    You're okay. It's okay now.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

    86   EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - ESTABLISHING                              86
         Along with the million other cars, FIND the Cadillac
         threading its way up to the main terminal.

    87   INT. CADILLAC XLR - AIRPORT                                       87
         Ryan tries to avoid eye contact with the TRAFFIC COP
         assisting the flow of cars.

                               RYAN (INTO PHONE)
                    I'm here... Oh shit!
         SCREEEECH! Ryan steps on the brakes, seeing something ahead.
         WHIP PAN AROUND to see what Ryan's staring at. Just ahead,
         JESSICA'S ESCALADE is pulling up to the curb.

                               JESSICA (VO)
                    What?

                              RYAN
                   Your car's here.
         Ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough-
         looking men exit the vehicle. We recognize them as Greer,
         Deason, Ellis and Hodges.

                              JESSICA (VO)
                   Hurry, Ryan! Just find Craig!
         Ryan hops out -- but stops when the car CALLS OUT TO HIM.

                             JESSICA (CONT'D)
                   Wait, Ryan! What about me--?!
         Ryan searches the car and finds the HANDSET in the armrest.
         As he grabs it and races after Greer into the airport, a
         Traffic Cop comes up to the car.

                              TRAFFIC COP

                   HEY, YOU CAN'T PARK HERE!!
         But it's too late.   Ryan's already gone.

    88   INT. LAX AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS                                     88
         Greer and his men stride through the airport like sharks
         honing in on bleeding prey.
         Soon, the Kidnappers break up into two groups: Greer and
         Ellis heading for the DEPARTURE GATES; Deason and Hodges go
         the other way towards the INFORMATION KIOSK.

         Ryan heads toward the --



                                                             57.







R9   INT. SECURITY CHECKPOINT - LAX                                  89
     Greer, who waits in the LINE OF PASSENGERS waiting to pass
     through airport's METAL DETECTORS. This is Ryan's chance.
     He cuts through the line.

                         RYAN
               Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My
               grandmother needs her walker...
     Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and
     BUMPS into him. As he does, NOTICE --
     ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special
     into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket.
     Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there.
     Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that
     we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands
     innocently the next line over--
     --but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd.
     Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to
     walk through the metal detector and...

     SFX:   BZZZZZZZTTH
     ...sets off the alarm.

                          DETECTOR OPERATOR
               Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
               emptying your pockets over here?
     Confused, Greer does. He lays his wallet on the table, then
     his keys... Then looks baffled as he pulls out -- the GUN 1

                            DETECTOR OPERATOR (CONT'D)
               Code red!     Code red!
     The response she gets is stunning. SECURITY GUARDS jump out
     of the woodwork with guns drawn. ALARMS go off. SECURITY
     GATES start coming down. Travelers start SCREAMING and

     PANICKING!

                            SECURITY GUARDS

               GET DOWN!    GET ON THE GROUND!!

                            ELLIS
                   (reaching for something)
               Wait, this is a mistake--

                             TENSE GUARD

               HANDS/     HANDS!!
     As one, the entire security force POUNCES on Greer and Ellis,
     TACKLING them to the ground and IMMOBILIZING their limbs.



                                                                58.

     And while that chaos is going on, Ryan slowly backs through
     to the metal detector...and starts running for Left Field.

                                                MATCH CUT TO:

90   INT. LAX AIRPORT - METAL DETECTORS - CONTINUOUS                  90
     GREER AND ELLIS are crushed under the dogpile of security.
     Behind them, a door slams open and a formation of NATIONAL
     GUARDSMEN race on-scene, showing just how seriously security
     is taken in the wake of Sept. 11th.

                                                CUT TO:

91   INT. CONCOURSE - LAX                                             91
     Ryan jogs down the concourse when--

                          PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM
               Attention travelers. Due to a
               security problem, all persons are
               required to clear the terminal and
               return immediately to the security
               checkpoint at the entrance to
               Concourse B...
     At once, everyone begins filing out of the terminal. Ryan
     looks like a salmon swimming upstream, the only figure moving
     against the tide of people rushing to get out.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               "Left Field" is in Terminal C.

                         RYAN
               Listen to me! They're clearing the
               terminal. Before your husband passes
               me, what does he look like?

                         JESSICA (VO)
               He's thirty-eight. Six feet.     Trim
               build. Thinning hair...

                          RYAN
                    (scanning the passengers)
               That's not enough! What's he
               wearing?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               I don't know! We have completely
               different schedules. I was fast
               aslee p--
                    (thinking it through)
               -- A suit... He wears glasses,
               thick rims, like Buddy Holly or--
     Bingo! The Buddy Holly glasses is what did it. Ryan sees a
     man in the distance hurrying in his direction -- CRAIG.

                            RYAN
               Found him!



                                                                      59.

        And just as Ryan bee-lines it towards Craig--

                  VOICE (OS)
        Excuse me, sir--
        Ryan turns and finds a NATIONAL GUARDSMAN right behind him.

                              NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
                   You can't be here now. You have to
                   leave the area.

                               RYAN
                  But --

                               NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
                  Now, sir.
        And as Ryan is marched away he sees--

                                                    CUT TO:

92      GREER AND ELLIS                                                     92
        Knees in their necks.    Hands covering their faces.

                              GREER
-- if you'd just listen to me! I
can explain! Someone reach into my
coat pocket! Goddamn it, reach

*'V
         A YOUNG GUARDSMAN does -- and in a big reveal, we see that he
         WITHDRAWS A BADGE. A Los Angeles policeman's badge...
       Ryan's jaw drops.      He can't believe it -- they're cops?!

                             YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                  Hey, this one's on the job.

                            RYAN
                  Holy shit, Jessica, these guys are
                  cops!

                               JESSICA (VO)
                  What?!
       The Guardsman's SUPERIOR OFFICER examines it.      Is it real?

                               SUPERIOR OFFICER
                  Run it.
                  (the Guardsman runs off;
                  turns back to Greer)
                  Is that your gun?

                             GREER
                       (hesitates)
                  --yes. Yes. It's my piece.

                            SUPERIOR OFFICER
                  Well, you're supposed to declare it.



                                                                  60.

                I know. We just got focused on a
                rabbit we're here to nab.
     Just then, the Young Guardsman returns.

                          YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                He's clean. Badge matches his I.D.

                      SUPERIOR OFFICER
                (grumbles)
                Unhook 'em. Stand down security.

     Ryan looks relieved when the airport's alarms SHUT OFF._ The
     P.A. system cheerily thanks everyone for their cooperation
     and, all around, security gates begin to rise.

                          RYAN
                    (noticing; to Guard)
               Hey, can I go now? Can I go?!
     The Guard nods, and Ryan takes off like a shot, racing back
     towards the bar.
     Ryan spots Craig Martin outside the Left Field sports bar.
     Ryan grabs him by the elbow and starts hustling him through
     the concourse.

                         CRAIG
               Hey, what the hell?!    Get your

               Shut up and keep walking. If they
               see us they'll kill us both.

                          CRAIG
               What--?

                          RYAN
               Your wife sent me.

                          CRAIG
               She did?   But how--?

               Would you hurry your ass?! You
               need to hide. They're here, and
               they're looking for you. They
               already have your family.
     Craig looks at him, growing terrified.

               Forget about the cash. Just get you
               and y9ur son home safely and we'll

     Trying to act inconspicuous, Ryan guards the entrance to the
     Men's Room. He's starts to check out a magazine rack at an
     adjacent concession stand when he hears:

                            CRAIG

               HEY, RYAN?    RYAN!
     Ryan turns. RACK FOCUS past Ryan to Craig standing fifty
     feet back, holding the phone out.

     In utter disbelief, Ryan turns back toward the gate -- and
     sees Greer, Ellis, Hodges and Deason, cornering another MAN.
     Tall. Lean. Thinning hair.
     And wearing Buddy Holly glasses.    The real CRAIG MARTIN.

109   EXT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. BUILDING - ESTABLISHING           109
      With an all cement exterior (and few windows), it's a
      cellphone user's nightmare.

110   EXT. SURFACE STREETS - DAY                                        110
      As Ryan huffs and puffs toward the building, he sees a BIKE
      MESSENGER bullshitting with a HOT DOG VENDOR. Ryan stops and
      stares at the PACKAGE POUCH on the seat and a flashy red BIKE
      HELMET hanging on the handlebars.
      The helmet is futuristic, like something The Flash might
      wear. Ryan eyes the Messenger, grabs the bike, hops on and
      peddles for dear life toward Craig's building with the
      Messenger hot on his heels.

111   EXT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. BUILDING                              111
      As Ryan arrives at the building, the Escalade pulls up in
      front of him and Greer, Hodges and Ellis file into the
      building.



                                                               70.
Ill                                                                  111


      Ryan skids to a stop.   Eyes the carrying pouch...

*12    INT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. - LOBBY - DAY                      112
      Ryan, carrying the carrying pouch and bike helmet, enters the
      lobby. Greer and the others disappear into an ELEVATOR.
      N9W inside, STATIC starts playing hell with their connection.
      Fine in some areas, terrible in others.

                           JESSICA (V.O.)
                Wait, we --(bzzt!)--ve to think!
                What --(bzzt!)--re we going to do?

                            RYAN
                 I have an idea...
      Ryan fights his way through the tourists to the elevator bay.
      Quickly scans the DIRECTORY. Among the long list of CPAs,
      there's a MAILROOM on the 3rd floor.

                                                   CUT TO:

113   INT. MOONEY'S BEDROOM - DAY                                    113
      Mooney (looking damn awkward in a suit and tie), lies on the
      bed, watching the news.
      In the background, Marilyn can be seen in the master
      bathroom, sitting before the vanity mirror in her wheelchair.
      She puts on makeup.

                           MARILYN
                In five minutes, I'll need you to
                give me a hand.

                           MOONEY
                Whenever you're ready, hon.
      Still wearing his holster, he shifts uncomfortably on the bed
      as he watches the news.

                          NEWS ANCHOR
                ...and authorities are now asking
                your help in identifying this man--
      Mooney jolts upright as they display A FUZZY PHOTO OF RYAN
      from the Verizon surveillance cameras.

                           NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)
                -- believed to be responsible for
                today's bizarre string of crimes,
                most notably the theft of an $80,000
                Cadillac at gunpoint.

                           MOONEY
                What..?
      Mooney watches as they continue to detail Ryan's "wild crime
      spree", but gets the bigger picture, realizing that every
      event --the Verizon store; searching for the Martin kid;



                                                                  71.

      stealing the Cadillac -- centers around the cellphone call
      Ryan tried to tell him about this morning.
      Detective gears turning, Mooney reaches for the phone on the
      bedside table. Dials 411.

                           OPERATOR
                 Thank you for using Pacbell. This
                 is Claire, how may I help you?

                            MOONEY
                 I need the phone number for a
                 residence. Jessica Martin in
                 Brentwood.

                           OPERATOR
                 That number is (310) 555-8364.    For
                 an extra seventy five cents-
      Mooney hangs up, dials the number. The phone rings and
      rings. Eventually, an answering machine picks up.

                           JESSICA'S VOICE  (VO)
                Hi, you've reached the hom  e of
                Craig and Jessica Martin.   We can't
                get to the phone right now  , but if
                you leave your name and a   message--
      Mooney listens intently -- and is troubled.

                           MOONEY
                     (to an oblivious Marilyn)
                The woman at the house didn't have
                an accent.
      Marilyn smiles, realizing he's really talking to himself.
      Mooney hangs up, thoughts racing. He reaches behind him, and
      without looking he grabs his wallet and keys.
      He then walks over to Marilyn and kisses the top of her head.
      She knows him, and knows something's up.

                           MOONEY (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry honey( but I have to
                check on something real quick.

                          MARILYN
                You've got to be kidding-

                          MOONEY
                Delay the reservation if you have
                to; I'll be back in twenty minutes.
      And Mooney's gone...

                           MARILYN
                Twenty minutes my foot.

                                                  CUT TO:

U4    INT. ELEVATOR - DAY                                             114
      A few SECRETARIES get out on the second floor.
      Alone with the others, Greer eyes the mysterious .38 Special.

                            GREER
                      (re: .38 Special)
                 Keep your eyes open.

115   INT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. - THIRD FLOOR - DAY                115
      Dripping with sweat, Ryan shambles out of the stairwell, the
      bike helmet now strapped to his head and the pouch over his
      shoulder -- just as the ELEVATOR ARRIVES behind him!
      As Greer, Hodges and Craig get out, Ryan turns and searches
      for the mailroom that's supposed to be here! Where the hell
      is-- Ah I He finds it and hustles into --

116   INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     116
      A wide COUNTER separates Ryan and a few BUSINESS MEN and
      WOMEN from the MAIL CLERKS that busily work the other side.
      Ryan leans against the wall, pretending to be an ordinary
      bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the dirty
      cops enter, brushing right past him.
      Craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter,
      desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally. He
      ignores Ryan completely, whose face is mostly hidden by the
      tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet.
      Craig notices an AGING SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area,
      but knows better than to make any waves.

                      MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                (recognizing Craig)
                Anything I can help you with Mr.
                Martin?

                           CRAIG
                Hey, Benny. This might sound
                ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD
                mailer into the chute this morning
                and I forgot to put down an
                address.

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Happens all the time. Let me see
                what's back there. Gimme a sec'.
      The Supervisor disappears into the back room.
      Greer and Hodges take a seat only a few feet away from Ryan.
      The moment is uncomfortable...and gets infinitely worse as--



                                                               73.

116                                                                  116



                          MAIL CLERK ,
                Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir?
      Ryan turns, realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is
      speaking to him.

                           RYAN
                Me?

                          MAIL CLERK
                You waiting for a package?
      Now everyone's looking at Ryan.     Including Greer.

                           RYAN
                     (facing away)
                Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick
                something up for Mr. Fountain over
                at the Bonaventure.

                           MAIL CLERK
                From what department?

                           RYAN
                I'm not sure... They said it was a
                contract, though, I know that, so
                what would that be, Legal?

                          MAIL CLERK
                What's the tracking number?

                           RYAN
                     (patting himself down)
                Uh... Right. Tracking number.
      It's looking grim.   Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Mr. Martin? I found a number of
                things that could be what you're
                looking for. Mind coming back to
                take a look?
      Hodges shoots Craig a look, "go".

                           CRAIG
                Sure.
      The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room.
      Unfortunately, Greer stays behind.

                           RYAN
                     (patting himself)
                I might... Maybe it's on the
                clipboard on my bike?
      Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and
      Craig disappear inside the vault.



                                                                 74.

116                                                                    116





                           RYAN (CONT'D)
                 I, uh, may need to call somebody.

                                                  CUT TO:

117   INT. MAILROOM - BACK ROOM                                        117
      There's an entire shelf that serves as a dead letter office.
      One plastic bin is filled with reusable interoffice
      envelopes, another bin is overflowing with small mailers,
      computer disks, unlabeled video tapes, Etc...

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Help yourself.
      HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers,
      opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside
      down -- and a DVD case slides out!
      A quick glance at the label, "ADT Digital Surveillance'.
      5/19/05 06:00 - 07:00" confirms it's the disc.

                           CRAIG
                This is it.
      Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over
      his shoulder.

                            HODGES
                Let's go.

                                                  BACK TO:

118   INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                                       118
      Ryan now sits by the window, cellphone pressed to his ear.
      Feigning frustration.

                          RYAN
                You believe this? Everyone's got
                their head up their ass over there.
      The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to.
      Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal
      is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window
      at the end of the hall.

                          MAIL CLERK
                    (impatiently)
                Sir? You think you could just go
                outside and get your clipboard?
      Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.

                            MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)
                Sir?
      Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone.
      At Hodges, almost out of the bank. As he and Craig near the
      door --



                                                                  75.

118                                                                     118




      A moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and
      suddenly realizes: This is the guy!
      It's now or never.   Ryan has to do something.

                           MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)
                 Sir!?

                            RYAN
                      (to Clerk)
                 Screw the package.
      Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a
      metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by--

                           MAIL CLERK

                 WHAT ARE YOU DOING--?!
      -- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!!   Hodges
      drops like a slaughterhouse cow.
      Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their
      lives. Craig dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has
      come to life; drawing down on them.

                           SECURITY GUARD

                FREEZE!
      Craig does.   But Ryan grabs him and moves, racing out of the
      bank.

                COME ON, LET'S GO!

119   INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                      119
      At the end of the hall, GREER sees Craig and Ryan running out
      of the mailroom. Drops his phone, draws his gun --

                           SECURITY GUARD (OS)

                FREEZE!!
      -- just as the Guard comes running out. His gun was fixed on
      Ryan, but now that he sees Greer with a piece, he trains his
      gun on him instead.

                          SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)

                DROP YOUR WEAPON!
      Ryan and Craig are struck in the middle of the crossfire.

                           GREER
                     (flashing his badge)

                L.A.P.D.! I'M A COP!

                           SECURITY GUARD

                DROP IT NOW!!
      The instant Ryan and Craig try to escape into a nearby
      stairwell -- Greer turns his gun on the SECURITY GUARD --

      BANG! BANG!



                                                                     76.

119                                                                        119


      -The Security Guard drops and Greer aims his weapon at Craig
      again!
      BANG! -- Greer fires.
      Craig, SHOT IN THE BACK, slams against Ryan with the impact.
      They fall half-in/half-out of the stairwell. Craig weakly
      shoves the DVD into Ryan's hands.

                             CRAIG
                 ..run...
      But Ryan is overwhelmed.       His legs feel like a thousand
      pounds of jelly.

                           CRAIG (CONT'D)
                 ..ruuuUUUUNNNNNN!!
      As Craig slumps to the ground, Ryan stares in shock -- but
      when Greer starts sending a hail of bullets toward them, he
      DIVES into:

120   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                                 120
      He starts flying down the stairs...but when he sees four
      BUILDING SECURITY GUARDS racing up from below--

                             RYAN
                Damn!
      --he turns around and starts RUNNING UP instead.

121   INT. MAILROOM - DAY                                                  121
      Hodges gets to his feet. Stumbles out, holding his gushing,
      broken nose. Yells at Greer, who's racing into the stairwell.

                             HODGES
                The kid!!

                             GREER
                No shit.

122   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                                 122
      With the Guards and Greer only a floor behind, Ryan thinks
      fast and CHUCKS HIS BIKE HELMET down the corridor, ELBOWS the
      In-Case-Of-Emergency Glass, setting off the FIRE ALARM -- and
      starts running UP.
      Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards
      sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.

                             GUARD
                     (racing down the hall)
                This way!
      The other Guards follow...but Greer isn't convinced.       On a
      hunch, he turns and continues running UP also.
      Peeking over the edge from the floor above--



                                                                  77 .

122                                                                      122



      RYAN
      Sees Greer and Hodges coming.     Big-ass guns out and ready.
      Shit.'
      THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM.     PEOPLE start filling the stairwell
      on every floor.
      Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs
      until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves
      open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof.
      He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--

123   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                               123
      GREER and HODGES reach the floor beneath. See the door
      swinging shut -- but neither fall for the bait. They runs up
      toward the-

124   EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                    124
      Ryan's eyes SCAN the rooftop. Construction is in progress up
      here; tarpapering. Huge ROLLS OF TARPAPER lie about,
      PALATTES holding supplies covered with TARPS, an industrial

      AIR CONDITIONER...
      Ryan quickly shoves a 2"x4" under the doorknob to jam it.
      Heart pounding, he races to the building's edge and looks
      down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down.
      Footsteps are approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts
      behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --

125   EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                    125
      GREER shakes the 2"x4" loose.     He and Hodges explode out onto
      the roof, looking for Ryan.
      Greer encircles the huge air-conditioner while Hodges hunts
      behind a large SATELLITE DISH. No Ryan.

                           GREER
                     (to Hodges)
                Here.
      Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp-
      covered stockpile and waits for Hodges to secure the other.
      This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around --
      But Ryan's nowhere to be found!

                             GREER (CONT'D)
                Dammit!
      No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that
      leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on
      ground level.



                                                                      78.

125                                                                         125




      Greer peers down the chute for long seconds...but nothing can
      be seen from this angle. It all falls to blackness.

      THE ALARM STOPS.
      Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence. The only
      sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell. He
      eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster, thinks...

      REVEAL --

126   INT. METAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS                                         126
      RYAN, wedging himself against the sides of the chute, tries
      to be as still as possible. Every slight movement makes the

      ALUMINUM BUCKLE AND GROAN.
      From his shirt pocket, Jessica's tiny desperate voice pleads.

                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I
      But Ryan just sits there.    Afraid to move.     Terrified to
      discuss Craig.

127   EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS                                                127
      Greer picks up a large roll of tarpaper and starts lugging it
      toward the open mouth of the chute...

.28   INT. METAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS                                         128
      Ryan holds his breath.    Trembling.   His leg threatening to
      rabbit-foot again.
      Straining to hear Greer, it's impossible not to hear:

                             JESSICA
                  You have to talk to me! Ryan,
                  please you have to talk to me--.'
      The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he
      catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the
      stressed metal.
      Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls
      the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear.
      Desperate to console her, Ryan --
      BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks
      up to see it angrily launching itself right at him!
      He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit.      He presses
      himself to one side but --
      WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS

      SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE!



                                                                       79.

      Ryan reaches out, but the phone goes sliding down the chute!

                                                     CUT TO:

129   INT. ATTIC                                                             129
      Jessica hears a loud SCRAAAAPE, CRASH and a wash of STATIC.

                               JESSICA
                   Ryan?!    OH MY GOD, RYAN?!   RYAN--?!

130   INT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME                   130
      The hulking Deason hears Jessica's PANICKED VOICE and stands
      with a start. As he moves toward the attic, he notices a
      small RED LIGHT FLASHING behind the bar. As he passes, he
      checks it out and--

                              DEASON

                   WHAT THE--?!
      WHIP PAN DOWN to what Deason sees: The red light is on one
      of the house phones. The LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR.
      And it's lit.
      Shaking like a bear pissing pineapples, Deason rages away
      toward the attic...

                                                    CUT TO:

      Jessica is curling herself into a tiny sobbing ball on the
      floor when -- WHAMM! -- the attic door crashes open. Jessica
      jumps. Deason looms there. Sees the phone.

                              DEASON

                   YOU STUPID BITCH!
      Jessica hurls the phone receiver away.

                             DEASON (CONT'D)

                   WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?! WHO HAVE YOU

                   TOLD?!

                              JESSICA

                   NO, DON 'T H URT M E--
      Deason roars up and grabs Jessica's neck with one hand.
      HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR,
      shattering it in a million pieces around her.
      Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she
      struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip.

                             DEASON

                   YOU AND YOUR KID ARE DEAD!
      She lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath...        You win.



                                                                         80.

                                    JESSICA
                        Don't hurt me, and I'll do
                        anything... Anything.. .
             There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason
             responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her
             flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty
             fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him.
             Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins
             to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted
             as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she
             flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper
             arm.
             Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs
             as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--

                              DEASON
                        (sarcastic)
                        Oooh.
             --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason
             looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt
             sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto
             the floor like a river.
             Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused.

                                   JESSICA
                        Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30
                        liters of blood per minute...and
                        there's only five liters in the
                        human body.
             Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the
             attic.

                                                         BACK TO:

             RYAN'S still trapped. Sounds of approaching SIRENS in the
             distance. Ryan listens for Greer; is he still there?
             BANG!!   BANG!!   Two more heavy TARPAPER ROLLS come right at
             him!
             The first one he gets lucky with, but the second NAILS HIM
             before bouncing furiously away and Ryan loses his grip
             completely and slides out of control.

 133         EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                   133
             GREER watches amazed when Ryan actually tumbles out of the
             ass-end of the metal chute into the dumpster. He drops the
             next roll of tarpaper ready to go and reaches for his gun --

--.

-434    EXT. INSIDE DJUMPSTER - CONTINUOUS                               134
       RYAN is in serious pain.    He frantically fishes through the
       refuse to find:

       SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE
       Or rather, what's left of it:      A million shattered pieces
       scattered everywhere.
       Ryan sifts through the plastic debris as if he had secretly
       hoped he could still use it. Yeah, right... He's barely able
       to sit up when --

       BLAM!! BLAM!! BLAM!!
       He ducks back down as bullets ricochet off the steel
       dumpster.
       As SIRENS get louder, closer, Ryan's got to make his move --
       he jumps out of the dumpster, landing on his ass on the
       opposite side of Greer.

       BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!


       Bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster and Ryan summons his
       courage -- and takes off limping!

135    EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS                                            135
       BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!! Greer's pistol is ill equipped for long-
       range shooting. The kid's too far away by now. He grabs his
       walkie --

                            GREER
                      (into walkie)
                 The kid's outside, headed toward

                            HODGES
                 -Gotta go, boss. The Guard's dead.
       Hodges waits by the rooftop door, looking concerned
       as COPS spill out around him onto the roof.



                            COPS
                 Who the hell's shooting up here?
       Greer points to Ryan bolting around the corner.

                           GREER
                 Sonofabitch shot the poor bastard

       Jessica races across the dead brown lawn toward the guest
       house/prison that holds her son. Getting her first good look



                                                                  82.

      at the secluded premises she's on confirms that screaming
      would do no good. She's on her own.
      When she reaches the guest house, she's shocked to find a
      HUGE LOCK on the front door. Frantic, she makes her way
      around the structure to a BIG BAY WINDOW. Though it's
      protected by SECURITY BARS, she can see Ricky through the
      glass.
      Jessica pounds on the glass, and Ricky turns.    When her son
      sees her, he races to the bars.

                              RICKY

      Jessica looks around for something to bend the bars with.
      There's nothing.

137   EXT. THE MARTIN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON                            137
      A gold FORD TAURUS pulls up in front. The driver door opens
      and Mooney gets out. Walks to the front door and KNOCKS.
      But this time, there's no answer.
      Mooney rings the bell. Still nothing. Suspicious, he checks
      around the side...and sees the back door SWAYING in the wind.

138   INT. MARTIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                 138


      Mooney's cop senses scream as he walks inside. A POLICE
      SCANNER chatters in the background. The place is a shambles.
      Someone's been looking for something. He then sees-
      BLOOD STREAKS the floor. It leads from over by the telephone
      to underneath the pantry door.

                             MOONEY
                       (calling into house)
                   Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody home?
      No answer.    Drawing his gun, Mooney stalks carefully into--

139   INT. MARTIN HOUSE - THE ENTRYWAY - DAY                            139


      A SMALL STAIRCASE leads up to the second floor. As Mooney
      starts up the steps, BOOM UP to the top to REVEAL:

      THE IMPOSTER JESSICA MARTIN (BAYBACK)
      Hiding in ambush at the top of the stairs, gun in hand. She
      listens to Mooney's footsteps and when she thinks he's neared
      the top -- she springs out, blasting away down the staircase!
      But Mooney's not there.



                                                                  83.

                            MOONEY
                 Drop your gun, now.   I got you.
      Now we see him. Still down in the entryway, behind some
      cover, gun aimed and steady.

                            MOONEY (CONT'D)
                 I said drop it.'
      Bayback relaxes -- then WHIRLS around, disappearing down the
      hall! Mooney curses and quietly jogs up the stairs,
      following her into--

140   INT. SHADOWY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                140
      A narrow hallway with multiple OPEN DOORWAYS on each side.
      The Imposter Jessica could be hiding in any one of them...
      Taking care not to give himself away, Mooney inches down the
      hallway. And just when he's thinking that he may have
      successfully created an element of surprise for himself--
      SFX: SQUEEEEAK -- the floorboards of the old house groan
      softly -- GIVING HIS POSITION AWAY!
      Instantly Bayback swings out from a doorway right next to
      Mooney, taps her gun to his chest pulls the tang--
      But Mooney DIVES OUT OF THE WAY! BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!   Two
      miss, but the third shot NAILS HIS SHOULDER!
      OOF! Mooney lands hard. Blood spreading out under his white
      dress shirt. He cocks his head... listening for the sound of-
      BAYBACK EJECTS A MAGAZINE and is about to reload--
      Mooney JUMPS UP, RETURNS FIRE -- slamming Bayback against the
      wall with two .38 caliber slugs. She collapses to the floor.

                            MOONEY
                Damn it!   DAMN IT!!
      Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to
      the kidnapper laying in the hall, bleeding out. Kicks her
      gun away and kneels.
      But for the first time, Bayback isn't tough.   Just scared.

                          BAYBACK
                ..a-ambulance...

                          MOONEY
                Tell me where Jessica Martin is or
                you bleed to death right here.

      Fuck this, Mooney kicks her ribs.



                                                                   84.

                            MOONEY

                  WHERE IS SHE?!
       Bayback struggles for air, reaching for him--

                            BAYBACK
                  ...I'm a cop...
       Bayback squeezes her eyes shut against a wave of pain -- and
       DIES. Mooney stares at her. What did she say? Starts
       patting her down.
       And that's when he finds her BADGE.     L.A.P.D.   23rd Precinct.
       She is a cop.

                              MOONEY
                 Oh shit...
       Mooney grits his teeth against a fresh wave of pain and picks
       up the phone, dials 911.

       Ryan wanders the streets. Checks his wallet -- a measly four
       bucks. Despair overtakes him and he almost gets CRUSHED as a-
       TOW TRUCK speeds by -- An old Hyundai mounts it like a hippo!
       A lightbulb clicks on for Ryan.

                              RYAN
                 Ho - shit!
       Ryan bolts to the nearest BUS STOP just as a BLUE LINE BUS
       pulls up.

       uses it to try to pry the bars apart. The limited leverage
       won't enable her to bend them enough for Ricky to squeeze
       through.

       And just then--

       SFX: GRAVEL CRUNCHING IN THE DRIVEWAY
       Jessica leans her head around the back corner of the
       guesthouse -- and sees the Escalade pulling in!



                                                                85.

143    EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE / INT. ESCALADE                     143
       Pulls into the driveway.
        Greer and his team are going over surveillance photos taken
        from the cameras at the Fegan Securities Building. The
  hotos are useless, though, as Ryan's face is obscured by his
E helmet and visor.

                            GREER
                 These are the best pictures you
                 could get of him?!

                            ELLIS
                 He was wearing a visor.
       Greer glares at him -- no shit -- and throws the pictures .

                            GREER
                 Useless!
       The car parks and Greer storms out, followed by Ellis and
       Hodges. They head for the house, and the moment they enter --
       Jessica reappears. But now she's STARING at something.
       The Escalade.

                            JESSICA
                      (to son; through window)
                 Baby, listen to me. I want you to
                 get away from this window. I want
                 you to go to the other side of the
                 room as far away from the door as
                 you can --

                            RICKY
                 No, don't leave me!     Don't leave
                 me!!
       The terror in his voice breaks Jessica's heart.

                            JESSICA
                 Honey, I'm getting you out of
                 there!

                 Where are you going?!

                            JESSICA
                 I'm only gonna be gone a second,
                 and then we're gonna go home, but
                 you have to do this first. It's
                 gonna be loud, but don't be scared,
                 okay? Now go find somewhere safe
                 like I told you.

      pretty shaken up.

                You're lucky. Shot went clean

      Mooney watches other PARAMEDICS carry sheet-covered corpses
      into awaiting ambulances. Flashbulbs POP from inside.
      A sedan pulls up and Mooney's relieved to see Tomlin get out.

                What the hell, Moon? It's all over

                Dana Bayback. From the 23rd.     She
                was one of the kidnappers.
      Tomlin looks stunned by the revelation.

                Let me call the tw9~three. See

      Tomlin pulls out a cellphone.

                I hate to think more cops are

145   EXT. POLICE. IMPOUND YARD - LATE AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING         145
      A GONZOLEZ TOW TRUCK drives up (like the one we saw at the
      airport), and stops temporarily beside:
      Simon Cowell, from the CADILLAC XLR incident, who stands at
      the window, screaming at the JADED CASHIER.
      His car idles just on the other side of an IMPOSING FENCE.

                               SIMON COWELL
                    Just give me my goddamned car!

                               JADED CASHIER
                    Don't take that tone of voice with
                    me, sir. I've already told you, we
                    do not release vehicles until all
                    impound fees are paid.
      In the E.G., NOTICE Ryan skulking closer, behind the GONZALEZ

      AUTO TOW TRUCK.

                          SIMON COWELL
                But I didn't cause it to get
                impounded! Can't you understand
                that?! It was stolen from me!

                           JADED CASHIER
                Sir, do you want the car back or
                not?
      Noticing Cowell standing at the window, Ryan presses further
      into the shadows, not wanting to be noticed.

                              SIMON COWELL
                Yes!     But I'm not paying for it!
      The Cashier signals a GRUNGY YARD WORKER on the other side of
      the fence.

                           JADED CASHIER
                Nevermind, Howie. Take 'er back.
      Howie nods, and just as he's about to drive the Cadillac back
      into the yard --

                           SIMON COWELL
                Wait, wait! All right you bloody
                fascist, I'll pay. But if there's
                even the slightest scratch on it...
      Howie smiles, thought so, gets out and splits. As Cowell
      angrily starts making out a check, the Cashier flicks the
      switch to open the gate, and as it opens--
      Ryan slips in. He sneaks behind the wheel of the idling
      Cadillac. And the moment Cowell hands over his check --
      VRRRROOOM!!    Ryan burns rubber out of there.



                                                                  88.

       Cowell chases it -- and watches in horror as Ryan takes a
       speed bump too fast and TEARS THE REAR BUMPER OFF THE

       CADILLAC XLR CONVERTIBLE IN AN EXPLOSION OF SPARKS!

      As he zooms away, Ryan searches the passenger seat with his
      free hand. He hunts through the car and finds -- HIS BLUE

      TOOTH VIDEO CELL PHONE!

                              RYAN
                 Thank you!
      As he flips it open, his eyes spot THE LAPTOP on the floor of
      the passenger seat.
Ryan thinks, pulls out his SECURITY DVD and pops it in.
At first, the SCREEN is a mere wash of digital gobbledygook--
And as Ryan grunts with frustration --
--a Hi-Res QUICKTIME MOVIE suddenly fills the screen:

      The Fagen Securities Building parking lot. A police pursuit

      TWO HISPANIC YOUTHS, forcing it to come to a dead stop.
      GREER and HODGES explode from their cars, guns drawn.
      BAYBACK and ELLIS come from the back. DEASON appears, and he
      and HODGES yank the teens out of the car, who struggle
      frantically to avoid vicious baton blows. When one decks
      Hodges and tries to run, ELLIS SHOOTS HIM in the back!

      WE QUICKLY PAN TO ANOTHER ANGLE:
      Inside the building, CRAIG gets up from his chair, hurries

       RYAN watches in horror. He PULLS OVER, too riveted to drive
       and watch simultaneously. Finally understanding the
       magnitude of this disc.

       And as BAYBACK drags a DEAD HISPANIC YOUTH out of the frame,
       legs disappear off-screen in short bursts.

       PAN DIAGONALLY TO ANOTHER ANGLE:
       And more terrifying, GREER stops picking up shell casings,
       turning his head ominously toward the CAMERA! Noticing us!
       Greer motions to several others; DEASON and BAYBACK, who rush
       OUT OF FRAME toward the front entrance.
       ANGLE ONE: At the SIDE DOOR, ELLIS and HODGES start kicking
       in the door with full force.

                           TELEMARKETER
                Look, sir, we can take your name
                off our list if you want, but you
                don't have to get nasty--

                             RYAN (VO)
                What--?    Who is this?

                              TELEMARKETER
                Mark.     At Mastercharge Credit Union-

                 just hit "Last Incoming Call"--
       Ryan suddenly puts it together.

                            RYAN (VO) (CONT'D)
                 You bastard.
       The Telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly.

       Greer listens intently to a call.   So who is on his end of
       the phone? Tomlin.

                            TOMLIN (VO)
                 Look, Captain, we've got to do
                 everything we can to protect this
                 guy. I mean, shit, with all his
                 years in he's owed a little.

       TOMLIN STANDING NEXT TO MOONEY OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE

                            GREER VO
                 He's with you? How'd he find out?

                            TOMLIN
                 Said something about a kid who came
                 into the station earlier--
       Greer grimaces, putting it together.

                            GREER
                 Early twenties? Stumbled out of
                 Brian Wilson's hamper?

                             TOMLIN
                 Yeah.   Something like that.

                            GREER
                 Tomlin. Take care of him.      No
                 witnesses.
       That's more than Tomlin bargained for.

                            TOMLIN
                 Are you sure that's necessary, sir?

                            GREER
                 You know once the shitstorm starts,
                 there's nothing I can do to save
                 you.

                            TOMLIN
                 Sure. That's what I thought.        I'll
                 tell him.



                                                                   92.

        Tomlin hangs up with a calm FLICK.   The Paramedic finishes up
        Mooney's bandage.

  161   INT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - STAIRWELL LEADING TO THE ATTIC 161
        Greer slips the cordless into his jacket pocket, continuing
        up the stairs. Hodges follows, staring expectantly.

                              HODGES
                  Well?   What'd he say?

                             GREER
                  You know a desk jockey named
                  Mooney?

                             HODGES

                  -- HOLY SHIT!
        Greer sees Hodges gaping up the stairwell. Following his
        look, Greer turns...and sees the attic door WIDE OPEN!
        Further in, he can make out Deason's bloody body and the
        rigged-together phone...
        In fact, the only thing Greer doesn't see is Jessica.

                             GREER

                  NO!
        Greer turns and pounds down the stairs.

 162    EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY                                 162

        JESSICA - IN THE ESCALADE
        She TWISTS the key and STOMPS the gas, sending the monster
        SUV on a collision course with -- SMASHHH -- the guest house
        window! The bay window SHATTERS and the security bar SNAP
        LIKE TWIGS as the Escalade BULLDOZES through!

--

 *,


        Unable to open the door because of all the debris, Jessica
        rolls down the window and yells to her son --



                                                                   93.

-^               -..           JESSICA
                  Ricky!    Come on!
       -- but he's frozen in fear at all the noise and dust.    He
       shakes his head. No.

                             JESSICA (CONT'D)
                  Baby, please! It's okay now.
                  We're gonna go home!
                       (glances back nervously)
                  Ricky, please!
       Somehow, the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to
       the Escalade, where his mother scoops him up into the cab
       just as--
       The kitchen door bursts open and Greer's team spills out into
       the yard. They spot her instantly.

                            ELLIS
                  Get out of the car!    Get out of the
                  goddamned car!!
       As they rush at her--

163    EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE/INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS             163
       Jessica throws the big car in reverse and tries to back out --
       but the Escalade's stuck! Caught by the debris, the wheels
       just spin.

                              JESSICA
                 Come on!    COME ON!!
       Jessica rocks the car forward, and back. Forward, and back.
       And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH!!
       The window next to Jessica's head EXPLODES in a shower of
       tempered glass, shocking us. Two arms snake in and wrap
       around Jessica's neck. Greer.
       But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS, hoping the big car will pull
       her free.
       It doesn't. As the Escalade surges away across the lawn,
       Greer's vice-like grip holds, PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken
       window and -- THUMP! -- to the guest house debris below.
       As Jessica watches in horror:

       THE DRIVERLESS ESCALADE
       Careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar.    Hodges
       races over and yanks Ricky out.

       GREER
       Balls his fist in Jessica's hair and yanks her around hard.

                            GREER

                 WHO DID YOU TELL?!



                                                                 94.

                            JESSICA
                 Nobody!

                            GREEK

                 LYING BITCH! ! WHO WAS THAT KID IN

                 THE MAIL ROOM?!
      Jessica screams as he yanks her to her knees.

                             RICKY
                 Stop it!   Don't hurt her!!
      Seething mad, Greer rips his gun from its holster and is
      literally about to blow Jessica's brains out when--

      SFX:   THE CORDLESS PHONE IN GREER'S POCKET STARTS RINGING!
      The entire world stops. There's an awkward moment: Jessica
      cowering, Greer recovering, the phone just ringing and
      ringing... The telephone is the only sound in the world,
      getting louder and louder with each ring until--
      Greer answers it.

                            GREER
                 Bad timing, Tomlin.
      But it isn't Tomlin on the phone this time.       It's--

                           RYAN (VO)
                 Feel like a trade?

      Greer snaps his fingers at Hodges, indicating it's Ryan.

                 The mysterious bike messenger.   How
                 did you get this number?
      In the Cadillac, PUSH IN on Ryan t9 show the CELLPHONE MANUAL
      he picked up at the Verizon store in his hand.

                           RYAN
                Gotta love modern technology... My new

                What do you want?

                           RYAN
                Just the woman and her kid.

                           GREER
                Who are you? What's your name?



                                                              95.

                           RYAN
                My name is F you. I've got your
                shit, pal, it doesn't work that
                way.

                           GREEK
                Really?
                     (turns to Ellis)
                Go cut the kid's throat.
      Though Ryan's eyes widen in panic, his voice remains cool.

                             RYAN
                Fine.     Your loss.   Nice talking to
                you.
      And Ryan hangs up. He waits nervously, sweating, staring at
      the phone for the longest seconds of his life--

                              RYAN (CONT'D)
                Ring.     C'mon, damn it, ring!   RING!
      Then it does. Ryan waits a couple rings, slowing his
      speeding heart, then nonchalantly picks up.

                          GREER
                So, how do you want to do this?

                          RYAN
                Put on a big ass Ronald McDonald smile,
                apologize to the kid and the woman and
                bring 'em to the Santa Monica pier.

                              GREER (VO)
                No.     Somewhere quieter.

                           RYAN
                Dude, you're lucky I'm still
                talkin' to your sorry ass. You do
                as I say, exactly as I say, or I
                hang up now and slap this bitch on
                Nightline, you know what I'm
                sayin'?
      There's a long beat.

                             GREER (VO)
                Fine.    But you come alone.

                             RYAN
                Done.

                           GREER (VO)
                How will I recognize you?

                           RYAN
                You let me worry about that.
                What's your cell number?

                          GREER (VO)
                (310) 555-8342. An hour then?



                                                                   96.

                            RYAN
                 I can hardly wait.
      Ryan hangs up.    A scared, but satisfied smile...

      Mooney grunts his gratitude as Tomlin heads toward a
      wasteland of warehouses. And just as any potential witnesses
      vanish from sight --
      Tomlin's cellphone RINGS!      He lowers the gun and answers the

                Good. We're making a trade with the
                kid at the Santa Monica Pier. Your
                boy can ID the kid for us. Bring him
                down.

                (relieved)
                I'm on it.
      Tomlin flips his phone closed and turns the car around.

                            TOMLIN (CONT'D)
                We caught a break with the kid. He's
                been spotted on the pier. Think you
                can hang on a little longer? Just
                enough to ID the kid before we patch
                you up?
      Mooney clearly doesn't want to say "no."     But it hurts.

                          MOONEY
                    (sweating profusely)
                Jesus, kid, calm down!!
      Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him
      backwards, SLAMMING his injured shoulder into the PIER

      RAILING.
      Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing--
      Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney COLLAPSE to the
      ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder. Ryan looks over
      to Chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion.

                           CHLOE
                Oh my God--
                     (checking Mooney)
                Someone call 911!
      A CROWD starts to gather when --
      Ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back.     Tomlin's
      gun.

                           TOMLIN
                It's over kid.
      Fuck! Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end
      of the pier.
      MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of
      Tomlin backing Ryan quietly into the crowd. Not trying to
      help. Not calling for an ambulance. In that instant, Mooney
      knows he's been betrayed. Tomlin's in on this.



                                                                 104.

                              TOMLIN (CONT'D)
                   For all the trouble you've caused,
                   you'd better have that goddamned
                   disc. Where is it?
      Just then, Greer appears through the crowd ahead of him.
      Like a nightmare, he closes in.
      Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his
      windbreaker and zips it up.

                                RYAN
                   Aw shit...
      Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, the

      TENSION...
      He KICKS BACK hard into Tomlin's SHIN. It is enough for
      Tomlin to release his grip and Ryan bolts.
      Tomlin recovers and raises his GUN to get a bead on Ryan, but
      it causes the crowd around him to PANIC.

                              CROWD GOER (OS)
                   Dude's gotta gun!
      Ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see
      Greer and Tomlin quickly gaining ground.
      He has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal
      with Greer and Tomlin. Ryan decides on the ocean. He runs
      to a MAN FISHING WITH HIS SON and uses their ice chest as a
      step. Just as he JUMPS THE RAIL -- Tomlin gets off a SHOT!
      SLIIIIIICEE!!! The bullet tears through Ryan's shoulder as
      he spins headlong into the Pacific!
      TOMLIN AND GREER run to the railing and see Ryan HIT the
      CHOPPY WATER below.

                              GREER
                   Under the pier. Go! Go!

      Ryan is struggling. Bleeding. Sinking. Dying. His lungs
      convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a thousand red-hot
      needles are pushing their way through his chest.
      The WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just
      as Ryan comes up for air he's SLAMMED into a wooden pylon!
      Ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater,
      BASHING him repeatedly against the pillars. It's not pretty.



                                                                  105.

       As he struggles toward the shore, he's constantly thrown back
       and forth underwater like a rag doll.

       The place is dark. Empty. An array of rowing shells covered
       in ghostly, flapping tarps make the place look vaguely haunted.
       This place is also filled with storage equipment, such as
       buoys and safety netting used by the beach patrol.

       He looks for anything that'll save him, but finds only

                 You better lie still. The
                 paramedics should be here shortly.
       But Mooney's obstinate.   He rises despite her best efforts.

      TOMLIN - By the time his eyes adjust to the dark, Ryan is
      nowhere to be seen. TARPS undulate over jumbles of boxes and
      equipment everywhere -- a hundred places to hide.
      Alone, Tomlin stalks among the equipment.     Gun out.   Hunting
      Ryan like a snake on the scent or prey.

                            TOMLIN
                 You're wounded kid, just give me
                 what I came for, and I'll let you
                 all go.
      Police sirens in the distance grow louder.
      Tomlin's offer goes unanswered.    That's when he notices the
      BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail
      to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends!
      It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit!
      He's gonna have to search this whole place--
      Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone,
      making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT
      MESSAGE to--

      Greer pulls out his ringing cell phone. On the text screen
      it says, "CALL HIM". Greer flashes an wicked grin, and dials
      the last number on his call log.

      Tomlin's ready to pounce.
      SFX:   Nearby, Ryan's cellphone starts to RING, betraying him!
      Instantly, Tomlin hones in on the noise -- coming from under
      a bulky tarp along the far wall -- and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it!
      The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault.
      Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp.

                            TOMLIN
                 Shoulda stayed at home this
                 morning, kid.
      And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing--
      Ryan's cellphone.   And nothing else.

      obliterated. Ryan, looking like a psychotic Babe Ruth, gives
      Tomlin two more vicious WHACKS before grabbing his cellphone
      and high-tailing it out of there.

                         okay. Put it down.
              Jessica slowly lowers the gun and looks into Ryan's face.

                                    JESSICA
                         Thank you for keeping your promise.
              As the cops move in and drag Greer to his feet, Ryan calls
              out to him.

                                   RYAN
                         Hey man, your shitty day is about
                         to get a whole lot shittier.
              Ryan flips open his phone and on the SCREEN plays the
              SECURITY FOOTAGE of the murder in the parking lot. We see
              that Ryan must've copied the DVD with his videophone.

                        Ain't that a bitch?
              And through the tears, Jessica manages a laugh. A small one.
              But enough to let us know everything's going to be okay. And
              as we PULL BACK on the scene--

              Ryan's shoulder has now been BANDAGED, his arm's in a sling.

                 It hurts... But you're making it
                 way better. I'm just glad it's
                 over.

                Modesty can be sexy.

                Next time, skip the shower.
      In the background, Jessica and Ricky exit a hospital room and
      join the two lovebirds.

                           JESSICA
                Craig's very weak, but the doctors
                say it looks promising. He's
                probably going to have to walk with
                a cane, but that's the worst of
                it... I'm just thankful.
      Chloe senses that Jessica and Ryan might need a moment alone.

                           CHLOE
                Come on Ricky, let's get a hot
                chocolate.
      A small smile forms on Ricky's exhausted face. Chloe leads
      Ricky down the hall.

                          JESSICA
                I can't believe I almost lost
                everything that means... I don't
                know how I can ever thank you.

                           RYAN
                I do.
                     (weak smile)
                Don't ever call me again.
      A shared laugh, then as they turn to the television--

      ECU OF SECURITY FOOTAGE OF THE PARKING LOT MURDER
      A CELL PHONE RINGS on a nearby table. They turn to look at
      it, neither one apparently having any idea to whom it might

      But this time, as we PULL BACK on the scene, we realize no
      one's going to answer it.

          EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN
          
          A small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles
          circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
          
          A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE
          COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to
          shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves
          OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.
          
          INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          She throws water on her face as the music continues. She
          looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead.
          She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day.
          The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she
          smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER
          Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS
          is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see
          much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's
          important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the
          following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                      Walter...time for school, honey.
          
          She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair.
          
                                WALTER

                               WALTER
                     It's cereal, it's supposed to be
                     cold.
          
          She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits
          on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again.
          
          EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING
          
          A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the
          street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's
          and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.
          
          INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in
          her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to
          an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that
          only a few other kids have arrived.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     We're here, sweetie.   Come on.
          
          She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward
          the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the
          school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as
          Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there.
          
          She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it
          rumbles away.

          
          INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
          Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room
          is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy
          wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening
          and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.
          
          Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created
          by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator
          to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns
          at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane
          toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Okay Sandy, what's the prob--
          
          The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off.

                     going near it.
          
          Christine struggles on the headset.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor,

                     sometimes do listen in on party

                     Are you sure? Maybe there's a
                     problem with the phone line. He
                     could be asthmatic, or --

                     Oh. No, I...I've never heard of
                     anything like that before either.
                     Guess there's a first time for
                     everything, right? No, I'm afraid
                     there's nothing we can do about
                     people abusing the equipment or...
                     themselves. I'm sorry. I --
          
          She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end
          as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Everything all right?
                               CHRISTINE

          She roller-skates off toward another operator waving another
          pink sheet of paper.

          EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY
          
          Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick
          telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself.
          
          Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees
          gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine
          closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up,
          we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows
          indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun.
          
          She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again.
          She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
          
          Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings,
          announcing the end of classes. Kids run outside, Walter among
          them. He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Hey, sport.
          
                                  WALTER

                     Okay. We learned about dinosaurs,
                     and I got in a fight with Billy
                     Mankowski.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     What happened?
          
                                  WALTER
                     He hit me.

                     a fight, but always finish it. So

                               WALTER
                     Because I hit him.

                               CHRISTINE
                     Well, the same day you were born,
                     something else arrived. It came in
                     the mail, in a box just slightly
                     bigger than you. You know what was
                     in that box?
                         (he shakes head)
                     Something called responsibility.
                     Now, to some people, responsibility
                     is fun, it's what you live your
                     whole life for. Other people think
                     it's the scariest thing in the world.
          
                               WALTER
                     So he ran away because he was scared
                     of what was in the box?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yup.
          
                               WALTER
                     That's dumb.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     That's what I thought.
          
          She turns and crouches down in front of him.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Walter, I decided a long time ago
                     that I would always tell you the
                     truth, that I would treat you like
                     a grown-up. I can't expect you to
                     respect me unless I respect you.
                         (beat)
                     I've never lied to you. Your father
                     leaving had nothing to do with you,
                     and everything to do with what was
                     in the responsibility box.
          
                               WALTER
                     Pinky-swear?

                               CHRISTINE
                     Pinky-swear.
          
          She takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug.    He smiles.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     First one to the corner store gets
                     ice cream!
          
          He laughs and tears off. She runs after him, letting him
          stay ahead of her the whole way.
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which
          is playing the closing moments of Amos and Andy. Christine
          enters and turns off the radio. He stirs, looks up at her.
          
                               WALTER
                     Did I miss Amos and Andy?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I'm afraid so, sport.   Come on now,
                     time for bed.
          
          She picks him up and carries him up the stairs.
          
                               WALTER
                     Are we still going to the movies
                     tomorrow?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie
                     Chaplin playing down at Grauman's,
                     and a new serial called The
                     Mysterious Airman.
          
                               WALTER
                     Who's that?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't know. Nobody does. That's
                     what makes him so mysterious.
          
                                WALTER
                     Oh.   Am I too heavy for you to carry?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Not for years yet, Walter.     Not for
                     years.
          
          And she disappears upstairs.

          INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          She's getting ready for the day and is almost out of the room
          when the phone rings. She hesitates, then picks it up.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: MARCH 10, 1928
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Hello?
                         (beat)
                     Oh, hello, Margaret. I'm fine,
                     thanks. No, I was just --
                         (beat)
                     You're kidding. When did she call
                     in sick?
                         (checks watch)
                     What about Myrna? I know she could
                     use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's
                     just...I promised Walter I'd take
                     him to the movies today. There has
                     to be somebody else....
                         (beat)
                     All right, I...guess we can do it
                     tomorrow. I'll get there as soon
                     as I can. But just until four,
                     okay? See you in a bit.
          
          She hangs up. She doesn't like this, but there's no way out
          of it. She straightens and heads out of the room.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          A disappointed Walter sits on the couch as Christine puts
          things together quickly.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     There's a sandwich and milk in the
                     icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley
                     if her daughter can stop by in a
                     couple of hours, just to --
          
                               WALTER
                     I can take care of myself.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Of course you can. She's coming by
                     to check on the house, not you.
          
          She stops in front of him, kneels down to eye height.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies.
                     Then we'll ride the Big Red down to
                     Santa Monica and walk on the pier.
                     How's that? That okay?

                         (he nods)
                     Good. I'll be back before it gets
                     dark.
          
                               WALTER
                     I'm not afraid of the dark.     I'm
                     not afraid of anything.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I know you're not, honey. That's
                     how I raised you.
                         (kisses his head)
                     Be good. See you in a bit.
          
          She heads out, the screen door clattering shut behind her.
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOME - CONTINUOUS
          
          She crosses the lawn and turns at the sidewalk, glancing back
          as Walter looks out at her from the window. She waves. He
          waves back. With one last look, she continues off.
          
          INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
          
          If the place was hectic before, now it's even worse: lines
          buzzing, voices chattering, operators following Christine
          around with papers and question.
          
                               OPERATORS
                     We've got lines jammed from here to
                     Ohio...he insists on talking to
                     someone in charge...I've tried
                     everything and the console's just
                     dead...I need your signature here
                     for a supply requisition....
          
          Christine glances up at the clock, 4:39.    She's already late.
          But she does what's necessary.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     All right, get me the Omaha routing
                     station, see if we can put the calls
                     through their switchers...and let's
                     get that console running....
          
          She hurries off to take care of it all, the others following.

          START on a clock which reads 5:20, then TILT DOWN as Christine
          comes out of the switchboard room, pulling on a sweater, ready
          to leave...as the floor manager steps out of his office.

                     your work reports, and I just want
                     you to know that I'm very impressed.
          
          She glances down the block. The street car is approaching,
          but she doesn't want to piss off her boss by running off.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     When I first suggested hiring female
                     supervisors, my superiors weren't
                     big on the idea. But you've held

                     Thank you, Mr. Harris, but I --
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Ben, please. Point is, we're looking
                     for someone to take on a managerial
                     position in our new Beverly Hills

                     That's great, Mr. Harris, I really
                     appreciate the vote of confidence.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Good, good...so maybe we could --
          
          She looks up to see the streetcar right at the stop.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I'm sorry, but I really have to go.
                     We'll talk on Monday. Good night!
          She races out to
          
          EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - CONTINUOUS
          
          running after the streetcar as it closes its doors.

          But the streetcar rumbles away before she can catch it.
          Frustrated, she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly.
          
          INT. STREET-CAR - EARLY EVENING
          
          Christine sits on the front bench, watching as the shadows
          lengthen, then pulls the bell. The car rumbles to a stop as
          she steps out onto the sidewalk.

          EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING
          
          She passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and
          continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street.
          We HEAR parents telling their kids to come in for dinner,
          radios playing music or radio dramas. Peaceful, charming.
          Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house --
          
          -- and it's dark, closed up. No lights on inside, no music
          or dramas on the radio. Dead silent.
          
          Christine pauses, then picks up her pace. No need to panic,
          he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house,
          where the lights wouldn't show.
          
          She goes to the front door.     It's unlocked.    She enters --
          
          INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
          
          It's dark, silent.    She puts her purse down.     Looks around.
          
                                   CHRISTINE
                      Walter?
          
          Nothing.   She goes into

          switching on lights as she goes. Nothing. She checks the
          refrigerator. The sandwich she made Walter is untouched.
          She moves to the staircase.
          
                                   CHRISTINE
                      Walter...?
          
          INT. WALTER'S ROOM
          
          She opens the door to his room.      No Walter.
          EXT. COLLINS HOUSE
          
          She crosses to the sidewalk.     Looks up and down the street.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                      Walter?   Honey? Time to come in.
          
          A little GIRL on a tricycle rolls past.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                      Susie honey, have you seen Walter?
          
                                   GIRL
                      Nuh-uh.
          
          The girl continues away. Christine's concerned, but she hasn't
          hit the panic button, not yet. She crosses the street to --

          -- and rings the doorbell.       The door opens and MRS. RILEY,
          forties, emerges.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                        Mrs. Riley, I'm sorry to bother you
                        at dinnertime, but I was wondering
                        if Walter was here.
          
                                  MRS. RILEY
                        No, I'm afraid not.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                        Do you know if Jamie was able to
                        look in on him?
          
                                  MRS. RILEY
                        Well, I mentioned it to her, but
                        she was going to a dance with some
                        of her friends...you know how
                        teenagers are. Is everything all
                        right?
          
                                   CHRISTINE
                        I'm sure it's fine, I just...
                            (beat)
                        Thank you, Mrs. Riley.
          
          Christine heads away.
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Christine stops at the sidewalk in front of her house, looks
          up and down the street, arms folded against the growing chill.
          
                                     CHRISTINE
                        Walter...?     Walter....
          She starts walking again. Faster now. Looking around trees
          and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide. She
          hears children playing. Laughing. She picks up her pace,
          homing in on the sound.
          
          She turns the corner to find three children playing, none of
          them Walter. She looks down the ominously empty streets.
          
          Her worry growing, she heads to the house.       Faster now.   Heels
          clicking on the hard sidewalk.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
          
          She bursts in, leaving the door open, looking around in case
          he came in while she was out. Nothing. She crosses to the
          phone, hesitates for just a BEAT, then picks up the receiver.

                     Yes, Operator, give me the police.
          
          There's a long pause as she waits, looks out the window, then:

                               CHRISTINE
                     No, he always stays around the house
                     when it starts to get dark. Can
                     you please send someone down here?

                     we don't dispatch units on missing
                     child cases for twenty-four hours.

          Christine walks down the street, arms wrapped around herself.

          Christine watches out the curtained living room windows, eyes
          red rimmed from worry but not from tears, not yet, as a police

          out and approach the house. HOLD on Christine's face, pale

                     as we have every day since we first
                     learned of her situation on the
                     radio, and in the newspapers.

                     We are told that the Los Angeles

                     it can to reunite mother and child,
                     and I am sure that is true.

                     police department this side of the
                     Rocky Mountains, that's not saying
                     a great deal.

                     Every day, new bodies show up along
                     Mulholland, or in ditches, the work
                     of Police Chief James Davis and his
                     so-called "gun squad." Every day
                     the needs of honest citizens are
                     put second to greed and personal
                     gain. Every day, the city sinks
                     deeper into a cesspool of fear,
                     intimidation and corruption. Once
                     the City of Angels, Los Angeles is
                     now a place where our protectors
                     have become our brutalizers...where
                     to be the law...is to be above the
                     law...where none dare speak truth
                     to power.
                         (beat)
                     But we will not be silent. We will

                     their failures in full view of the
                     public. We will not be intimidated.

          Christine walks past the door to his bedroom. Looks inside.
          Goes over to the bed. Her hand lingers, touching it, UNDER:

          Christine and Mr. Harris, the floor manager, approach the
          doors to the switchboard room.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     I mean, if you need more time --

                     The police are doing all they can,
                     and frankly I could use the money.
                     It's been almost a month, and...it
                     wouldn't do any good to find Walter
                     and bring him home if he doesn't
                     have a home to come back to, right?
          
                                  MR. HARRIS
                     Of course.
          
          He smiles as he says it, but there's the sense that he doesn't
          think Walter's coming back. It's been too long. She senses
          it, but moves past it, pushing open the door and entering
          
          INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          As loud as before...until the operators see Christine, and
          the noise stops. She tries to smile, as if to say, I'm okay,
          but can't quite manage it.

          Several women approach and hug her as the noise level begins
          to climb, but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Well...I'll leave you to it, then.
          
          She nods as he exits, then heads off herself.
          
          INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - LATER
          
          Christine moves from station to station, the noise level still
          noticeably low. Every time she approaches an operator, they
          lower their voices, as if not to bother her.
          
          One operator holds up a pink request sheet. Christine starts
          toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor
          and hands it off. Knowing she has to do something about this,
          she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says:
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Excuse me, can I have your attention?
          
          The room grows quiet.   Everyone is looking at her.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Listen, everyone, I appreciate your
                     consideration, but I'm not made of
                     porcelain. I won't break down and
                     cry if the station to station call

                         (a thin smile)
                     Actually, I...promised myself that
                     I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself
                     cry...until I knew, one way or
                     another, what....
                         (beat)
                     Point is...I like the noise here.
                     So don't be afraid to talk and...push
                     buttons, and drop things. If it
                     wasn't noisy, how would I know I
                     was in the right place?
          
          She manages a thin smile as the place returns to normal.
          
          EXT. PHONE COMPANY LUNCH AREA - AFTERNOON
          
          Mr. Harris steps out into the lunch area where a number of
          the operators and supervisors are hanging out.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Excuse me, has anyone seen Christine?
          
                               OPERATOR
                     I think I saw her in the back office.
          
          He nods his thanks, and continues off.

          INT. PHONE COMPANY - BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          He approaches the door, slowing as he HEARS Christine inside.
          
                               CHRISTINE (O.S.)
                     -- well, if you do hear anything,
                     would you let me know? Thanks, I
                     appreciate it. Goodbye.
          
          A hang-up, then dialing.   He glances in the open doorway.
          
          Christine sits at a table, phone in hand, a list of phone
          numbers in front of her. The list reads LAS VEGAS MISSING
          PERSONS DEPARTMENT, SACRAMENTO MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT,
          SAN FRANCISCO MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT...on and on...with
          each having multiple checks beside it, indicating all the
          times she's called. Her lunch sits untouched beside her.
          
          She puts a check next to LAS VEGAS MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT
          then looks up as someone answers at the other end of the phone.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Missing Persons department, please.
                         (beat)
                     Yes, hello, this is Christine
                     Collins, I...yes, fine, thank you.
                     I was just checking back to see if
                     you had found any missing or lost
                     children that might match the --
                         (beat)
                     I see. No, I appreciate that, it's
                     just...it never hurts to make sure
                     all the lines of communication are
                     working. I mean, that's what I do
                     for a living, right?
                         (beat)
                     Well, I'll try back next week. If
                     you do hear anything in the meantime,
                     would you be sure to let me know?
                     Thanks. Goodbye.
          
          She hangs up and ticks another department off the list and
          dials again. Mr. Harris heads away, deciding that whatever
          it was he planned to talk to her about...it can wait.
          
                               CHRISTINE

          EXT. DINER - AFTERNOON
          
          A single car is parked in the dirt lot outside the small,
          roadside diner.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: DE KALB, ILLINOIS.   JULY 10, 1928

          INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS
          
          THe COOK who owns this dive is cleaning the griddle and keeping
          an eye on the only two customers in the place: a MAN and a
          young BOY, both wearing hats, as was the custom. They're
          unkempt, dirty, like they've been on the road a long time.
          They finish the last of the food as the cook approaches, tears
          off the bill and puts it on the table.
          
                               COOK
                     Two dollars.
          
          The Man reaches for his wallet.   Pats an empty pocket.   Tries
          the other pocket. Nothing.
          
                               MAN
                     Hell...looks like I left my wallet
                     at home. Can I owe it to you?
          
                               COOK
                     No credit. Pay up or I call the
                     cops. I'm tired of bums like you
                     coming around here.
          
                               MAN
                     I'm not trying to stiff you, chief.
                     I just left my wallet at home, that's
                     all. I'll go back and get it.
                     Five, ten minutes tops.
          
          The Cook hesitates; he doesn't want the trouble of bringing
          in the cops, but he doesn't want to get stuck, either.
          
                               COOK
                     You got any collateral?
          
          The Man glances at the Boy seated beside him.   The boy's face
          is dirty, partially obscured by the hat.
                               MAN
                     Can't ask for better collateral
                     than a man's own flesh and blood,
                     right?
                         (to the boy)
                     You stay here, son, I'll be right
                     back.
          
                               BOY
                     But --
          
                               MAN
                     Now don't give me any trouble.
                     He's a good man to trust us like
                     this. You just sit here while I go
                     get my wallet. Okay?

          The boy nods reluctantly, looks away as the man rises.
          
                                COOK
                      Ten minutes, then I'm calling the
                      cops.
          
          The Man nods, exits and drives off.     The Cook squints warily
          at the Boy, then at the wall clock.     It's 2:00.
          
          EXT. DINER - LATER
          
          No car.   Just the empty parking lot.
          
          INT. DINER - ON CLOCK
          
          It's 3:15. The Cook is annoyed.      He glances to the Boy, who
          won't meet his gaze. Finally:
          
                                COOK
                      Ah, hell....
          
          He goes to the phone.    Clicks the receiver a few times.
          
                                COOK
                      Hello, Myrtle? It's Harve, down by
                      the diner. Would you get me Sheriff
                      Larsen? Yeah, I'll wait.
          
          He casts a sour look in the boy's direction.
          
                                COOK
                      What's your name, son?    Son...?
          
          The boy takes a BEAT, looking out at the road.    Then:
          
                                BOY
                      I don't remember.
                                  COOK
                      Swell.
          
          INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
          
          As before, Christine hurries from one station to another,
          lost in the barely-managed chaos. She stops at one station,
          glancing over papers, then looks over at --
          
          -- the window to Mr. Harris' office, where he is talking with
          a police officer, CAPTAIN J. J. JONES, 30s, serious, arch.
          
          She slows, unable to look away, a growing dread settling in
          her heart. Harris points out the window. Points...to her.
          The police captain nods and enters the switchboard room.
          
          As Jones heads for her, the strength goes out of Christine's
          legs. She holds onto the a desk as he stops before her.

          She manages a nod. Behind her eyes is the terror: he's going
          to tell me my son is dead. The room gets very quiet.
          
                               JONES
                     My name is Captain J. J. Jones,

                     missing child cases, including your
                     son's, and....
                         (beat, a smile)
                     He's alive, Mrs. Collins. He was
                     picked up two days ago by local
                     police in De Kalb, Illinois. He's
                     safe and unhurt. He was in the
                     company of some drifter, we've got
                     an APB out for him now, and --
          
          But she hasn't heard anything past he's safe and unhurt. She
          almost goes to the floor as other women rush toward her, crying
          and embracing her.
          
          For the first time, Christine cries, great wracking sobs, all
          the emotion she's been fighting back all this time coming out
          at last...he's okay...he's okay.

          Jones and Christine are in a police car pulling up to the
          train station. It moves through a police line holding back a
          crowd of reporters who SHOUT questions at the passing car.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     All these reporters...you didn't

          As Christine and Jones step out, they're mobbed by the press.
          Jones smiles splendidly for the cameras, waves, one arm wrapped
          around Christine, who looks stunned by it all.

                               "WALTER"
                     Did you know that Los Angeles is

                     But with all this attention, who
                     knows, maybe they will.
          
          The boy turns his attention back out the window as we HEAR
          the WHISTLE of the train pulling into Union Station.
          
          INT. UNION STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY
          
          We HEAR the same train whistle from this side as Christine
          and Jones come to the ramp, POLICE CHIEF DAVIS is waiting.
          The reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce

                     hours before filing a report, but --
          
                               DAVIS
                     Technicalities aside --
          
          The train stops.    Doors begin to open.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes...other than that, no complaints.
                     They've all been wonderful.
          
                               DAVIS
                     Good, then you won't have any problem
                     telling that to the press, and how
                     the LAPD is concerned first and
                     foremost with the safety of --
          
          But she's already running down the platform as people start
          to step off the train. Jones exchanges a look with Davis.
          
                                 JONES
                     Women.    Just a sec....
          
          He trots off to catch up with Christine, who walks alongside
          the train, looking from window to window, anxious, eager.
          
          Then: the Matron gets off the train, her frame momentarily
          blocking the view of the boy beside her...but Christine spots
          them. With Jones not far behind, she breaks into a run.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Walter...Walter!
          
          She runs toward them. The matron turns, sees her, smiles and
          gets out of the way, revealing the boy.
          
          Christine stops. Staggers so hard she almost falls. She
          steps forward slowly, a hand going to her mouth. For a moment,
          we're not sure what's going through her mind. She looks to
          the matron, who smiles. Looks to the boy, who smiles.
          
          Then she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as Jones comes
          jauntily alongside her.

                                JONES
                     Well?   Aren't you going to --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's not my son.
          
          Jones freezes at the words.
          
                               JONES
                     I...what are you --
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     He's not my son.
                         (beat)
                     He's not my son.
          
                               JONES
                     I'm...I'm sure you're mistaken.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                     Mistaken?
          
                               JONES
                     He's been through four long, terrible
                     months...he's gone through changes,
                     lost weight --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I know my own son.
          
          He glances over his shoulder to where the Chief of Police is
          waiting, not aware of any of this, and beyond him...the press.
          
                               JONES
                     I'm just saying...I mean, you're in
                     shock, and he's changed, and --
          
          He turns from her, stoops down to look at the boy.
                               JONES
                     What's your name, son?   Can you
                     tell me your name?
          
                               "WALTER"
                     Walter Collins.
          
          Christine steps back as though slapped.     This can't be.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     It's a common name, it --
          
                               JONES
                     Do you know where you live, Walter?
                     Do you know your home address?
          
          The boy considers for a moment...then:
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                   24.
          
          
                                "WALTER"
                     My house is at 210 North Avenue 23,
                     Los Angeles, California.
                         (beat)
                     And that's my Mommy!
          
          And he RUNS to her, grabbing her around the waist, which only
          magnifies her horror. Jones has no idea what to make of her,
          or this, or the boy. The only thing he knows is that the
          chief of police is standing right over there, smiling now
          that he thinks he's seen a mother and child reunion. The
          press is nearly insane trying to get through to them.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins...listen to me. I
                     know you're feeling uncertain right
                     now, but that's to be expected...a
                     boy this age changes so fast...but
                     we've compensated for that in our
                     investigation. We're experts in
                     child identification. There's no
                     question that this is your son.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     It's not Walter.
          
                               JONES
                     It's not Walter as you remember him.
                     That's why it's important for you
                     to take him home, on a...trial basis.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     A trial basis?
          
                               JONES
                     Once you've put him back in familiar
                     surroundings, and given yourself
                     time to recover from the shock of
                     his changed condition...you'll see
                     that it is him. I swear to you,
                     Mrs. Collins. I give you my word.
                     Trust me...this is your son.
          
          She looks from him to the boy...who is not terribly dissimilar
          from Walter...so that even the audience may not be entirely
          sure if it's him or not...and part of her wants desperately
          to believe...the pressure is immense.
          
                                JONES
                     If there's any problem, any problem
                     at all, come and talk to me and
                     I'll take care of it.
                         (beat)
                     Mrs. Collins...he has nowhere else

          It's an agonizing moment, then finally:
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I...look, I'll take him home, but
                     only because I...might not be
                     thinking clearly right now, and --
          
                                  JONES
                     Thank you.
          
          Without giving her a moment to reconsider, he waves and the
          Chief of Police approaches as the press rushes toward them.
          
          In an instant, they're overwhelmed by people shouting
          questions, flashbulbs popping, a fever of excitement.

                     How does it feel to have your son
                     home, Mrs. Collins? What did you
                     think when you saw him for the first
                     time?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     It was...it's...hard to explain.
          
                               JONES
                         (jumping in)
                     It was certainly quite a shock. At
                     first she hardly recognized him.
                     Perfectly natural, the boy's been
                     through quite an ordeal.

          He poses Christine and "Walter" so she is holding the boy in
          her arms. Dazed, stunned, confused, she manages to smile for
          the cameras. Bulbs FLASH and --
          
          -- time SLOWS DOWN, the SOUND MUTED, as Christine looks around
          at it all as though in a dream...reporters shouting questions
          she doesn't hear...bulbs flashing...the boy beside her, smiling
          at it all. He looks at her, mouths the word Mommy, as --
          
          INT. POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          -- the car door SLAMS and she and the boy sit side by side.
          The silence is in profound contrast to the madness of a moment
          earlier. An officer gets in they drive off, passing Jones
          and the Chief of Police, talking quietly off to one side.
          
          Christine looks to the boy.   He smiles at her.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          The only noise is the clock on the wall, ticking. Christine
          sits at one end of the table, "Walter" at the other. Studying
          him. He is finishing a sandwich, not meeting her gaze.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Was the sandwich all right?
                         (he nods)
                     Would you like some more milk?
          
                               "WALTER"
                     No.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, thank you.
                               "WALTER"
                     No, thank you.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Now you need a bath. You're covered
                     with soot from the train ride.
          
          He turns, and heads up the stairs.   She follows.
          
          INT. HALLWAY FRONTING BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Carrying a pair of pajamas, Christine comes into the hall and
          stops in front of the bathroom door. Knocks.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I found you a pair of pajamas. I
                     bought them for Walter but he didn't
                     like the fabric, so --

                     Ow!
          
          She hears him fall and pushes the door open.
          
          INT. BATHROOM
          
          She helps "Walter" stand, discreetly turned away from us.

                     Are you all right?
          
                                "WALTER"
                     I fell.   Stupid tub.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Did you hurt yourself?     Let me see --
          
          She stops suddenly, reacting to something we don't see.
          Looks slowly looks up to his face.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     ...circumcised....
          
          She takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom.
          
          INT. HALLWAY
          
          She places him against the wall where she measured Walter's
          growth over the years. The marks put him four inches shorter
          than the one labeled March. She looks at him, very serious.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     The last time I measured Walter --
                     the last time I measured my son --
                     he was four inches taller than you
                     are right now.
                         (beat)

                     Who are you?
          
          He says nothing.   HOLD on her look of growing desperation.
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Jones walks quickly down the hall, trying to look interested
          in a clutch of papers in his hands, Christine following after.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's not my son.

          CHANGELING A True Story                                   28.
          
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't know who he is, or why he's
                     saying he's Walter, but there's
                     clearly been some kind of mistake.
          
                               JONES
                     We agreed you would give him time
                     to adjust --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's four inches shorter than Walter.
                     Boys his age don't shrink. If
                     anything, he should be taller.
          
                               JONES
                     Maybe your measurements are off.
                     Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable
                     explanation for --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's circumcised. Walter wasn't.
          
          Jones glances back, uncomfortable about discussing circumcision
          with a woman in public view. He lowers his voice.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins...your son was missing
                     for four months. For at least part
                     of that in the company of an as-yet
                     unidentified drifter. Who knows
                     what such a disturbed individual
                     might have done? He could have had
                     him...circumcised... might have --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Made him smaller? Captain, please --
          
          He's on the move again, stepping into --
          INT. JONES' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- and getting behind his desk as Christine follows him in.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     -- why won't you listen to me?
          
                               JONES
                     I am listening, damn it, I --
                         (beat, calmer)
                     I am listening. And I understand
                     your feelings. He's changed, no
                     mistake. You've both been through
                     a terrible experience. That's why
                     he needs your support and love to
                     bounce back.

                                 CHRISTINE
                       Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce
                       back as my son if you coated him in
                       rubber and dropped him off the roof.
          
          He sits, shaking his head.
          
                                 JONES
                       Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins?
                       You seem perfectly capable of taking
                       care of the boy, your work pays you
                       enough to attend to his personal
                       needs...so I don't understand why
                       you're trying to run away from your
                       responsibilities --
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       I'm not running away from anything,
                       least of all my responsibilities.
                       I'm even taking care of that boy
                       because right now I'm all he has.
                       What worries me is that you've
                       stopped looking for Walter.
          
                                 JONES
                       Why should we look someone we've
                       already found?
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       But you haven't found him. He's
                       still out there somewhere, lost,
                       maybe hurt....
          
                                 JONES
                       His identity has been confirmed by
                       the best minds in the field of child
                       identification, people who know
                       what they're doing.
                                 CHRISTINE
                       And I don't? Captain, look, I don't
                       want to cause trouble for you or
                       the department. Honestly I don't.
                       I know you've done everything you
                       can...but there's been a terrible
                       mistake, and I need your help if
                       we're going to correct it...before
                       it's too late. Please.
          
          She exits.   Annoyed, Jones paces, then picks up the phone.
          
                                 JONES
                       Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.

          INT. COLLINS HOME - DAY
          
          Christine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings. She
          opens the door to find a police officer and DR. EARL W. TARR,
          sixties, mildly eccentric in appearance.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr.
                     Captain Jones sent me. I consult
                     with him from time to time on
                     juvenile cases. May I come in?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Oh...yes, of course.
          
          She steps aside, and Dr. Tarr enters, looking around.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Thank you for coming. I'm surprised
                     Captain Jones moved so quickly. I
                     was starting to think he didn't
                     believe me.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Well, I'm here now, and we'll put
                     all that to rights. Where is the
                     boy?
          
          He looks up as "Walter" comes downstairs. Noting that he
          said "the boy," not "your son," Christine looks relieved.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Ah! There he is. A handsome young
                     man. He has your eyes, doesn't he?
                     And a little bit of the nose. Very
                     fit, in spite of all his travails.
                     A very resilient boy you've got
                     here, Mrs. Collins.
          As he bends down to look more closely at "Walter," Christine
          stiffens...she can't have heard that right.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Doctor Tarr, I thought you were
                     here to help me.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     I am. Captain Jones said the boy
                     had gone through some extreme
                     physical changes, and asked me to
                     look in on him...to reassure you in
                     this your time of motherly concern.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     My "motherly concern" isn't for him
                     because he's not my son.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                           31.
          
          
                                DR. TARR
                     Statements like that will hardly
                     help the boy's self-esteem, now
                     will they?
                         (beat)
                     Captain Jones said something about
                     a change in height...?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's four inches shorter than --
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Ah, well...hardly a mystery, Mrs.
                     Collins. We've known for some time
                     that trauma can affect the growth
                     of children. Given the stress of
                     the last four months his spine may
                     have actually shrunk. It's uncommon,
                     but within the realm of possibility.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     What about the circumcision?
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Very likely his abductor thought it
                     appropriate. After all, circumcision
                     is hygienically sound. Must have
                     been quite traumatic at the time.
                     No wonder he's submerged the memory.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Look, doctor --
          
                               DR. TARR
                     As you can see, there's a perfectly
                     sound medical explanation for all
                     of this. But it's good for you to
                     raise these questions. You should
                     be apprised of all changes the lad
                     went through during his absence.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Wouldn't I know whether or not he
                     was my son? I'm his mother.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Which means you're in no position
                     to be objective. You are looking
                     through the prism of extreme emotion
                     at a boy who has changed from what
                     you remember. He isn't the same
                     boy that left here, just as a boy
                     who goes off to war and returns
                     isn't the same anymore.

                     A mother's heart, driven by intuition

                     that this cannot be your son. But
                     that doesn't change the facts.

                     I'm willing to put my theory to the

                     are you?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     What're you --
          
          Before she can react, he takes Walter by the hand and leads
          him outside. Christine follows them out to --
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- as Dr. Tarr strides onward, the police officer and "Walter"
          walking alongside as Christine brings up the rear. A few
          houses down they come to a group of CHILDREN playing.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Hello, children, my name is Dr.
                     Earl W. Tarr. I'd like to ask you
                     some questions.
          
                               1ST KID
                     My mom says we're not supposed to
                     talk to strangers.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Good boy. Quite right. But as you
                     see I'm with the police, so it's
                     all right. Now, I'm sure you know
                     Mrs. Collins here, and her son,
                     Walter. How many of you recognize
                     this young boy as Walter Collins?
          
          He looks from one child to the other. They don't reply.
          Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Now, now, no need to be afraid.
                     Surely you knew Walter, and played
                     with him? So which of you can
                     identify Walter for me, for his
                     mother, and for the police? This
                     officer would want you to do the
                     right thing as good young citizens.
          
          The kids exchange a glance. It's clear they don't recognize
          the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and
          the police officer. A few reluctantly raise their hands.
          Another of them goes to "Walter," who is shorter than he is.

                               2ND KID
                     Walter was as tall as me....
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Yes, precisely. He was as tall as
                     you. Now he's not. He's lost a
                     little height, you see. It's a
                     thing called trauma. With luck,
                     none of you will ever have to find
                     out about it yourselves. So other
                     than that, do you recognize this as
                     your friend, Walter Collins?

                               DR. TARR
                     Already ahead of you, Mrs. Collins;
                     children can be intimidated. But
                     not adults. Shall we try a neighbor?
          
          He heads off again, like some very tall, strange bird marching
          down the street. Christine exchanges a look with the kids,
          then heads off to follow.
          
          EXT. RILEY'S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Tarr, Christine, Mrs. Riley, the officer and "Walter" stand
          on the porch.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     -- and we'd appreciate it if you
                     could make a positive identification
                     for us.
                               MRS. RILEY
                     I'd be happy to. I saw the boy
                     often. Come closer, son.
          
          She stoops down, studies "Walter's" face, turns it from side
          to side. Squints at him. He squints back at her. Note:
          she's not wearing glasses. Finally:
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Take your time...be sure.
          
                               MRS. RILEY
                     Oh, yes...yes...that's Walter all
                     right. Used to come here all the
                     time to play with my nephew, Roger.

                               DR. TARR
                     Thank you, Mrs. Riley.   You've been
                     a big help, I --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Before we go...Mrs. Riley, do you
                     have the time?
          
                               MRS. RILEY
                     Certainly....
          
          She looks at her watch. Holds it farther away. Can't quite
          focus on it. Pulls her glasses out from inside her blouse.
          
                               MRS. RILEY
                     My last concession to vanity; men
                     don't make passes at women who wear
                     glasses, you know.
                         (checks the watch)
                     Five o'clock.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Thank you.
          
          Mrs. Riley nods and heads inside as Christine looks to Tarr,
          who shrugs off what was just demonstrated.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     A boy is much larger than a watch,
                     Mrs. Collins.
                         (to "Walter")
                     Come along, son.
          
          Tarr takes "Walter's" hand and heads away, Christine following,
          anger growing in her eyes as we HEAR:
          
                               CHRISTINE (V.O.)
                     This is absolutely outrageous!
          INT. COLLINS HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
          
          She is on the phone, "Walter" finishing up his dinner in BG.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Captain, I...no, listen to me, this
                     so-called doctor paraded me around
                     my own neighborhood like some kind
                     of derelict mother who couldn't
                     even recognize her own --

                     He found what he expected to find,

                                 CHRISTINE (Cont'd)
                     I thought we had an understanding,

                          (beat)
                     That I was embarrassed isn't the
                     issue, the point is you're wasting
                     time when you should be looking for
                     my son, I --
                          (beat)
                     Then I want to see this report, so
                     I can refute it, before it goes to
                     anyone else, all right? Fine.
          
          She hangs up. Hard. The events of the day have her teetering
          on the edge, but she's holding on. She pulls herself together
          and goes to the sink, furiously doing dishes for a silent
          BEAT before "Walter" looks up from his now-empty plate.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     I'm finished. Can I go to my room
                     now?
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Yes.   Go on up.
          
          "Walter" rises, as Christine continues to clean dishes, not
          looking back at him. Exhausted mentally, physically and
          emotionally. He goes to the door, stops, turns.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     G'night, Mommy.
          
          Christine fumbles the plate and it SMASHES to the floor.   She
          turns furiously to "Walter."
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Stop saying that! I'm not your
                     mother! And you're not my son!
          She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING
                     THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY
                     SON BACK!
          
          He tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes.
          
                               CHRISTINE

                     I want my son back...god, please...
                     make it stop...just make it stop.
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          "Walter" is in bed, his back to the door, as Christine appears
          in the hallway. She steps into the room, sits on the bed.

          He doesn't move.   Her voice is soft, but firm.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     I was wrong to yell at you. You're
                     still a child, and I think you don't
                     really understand what you're doing,
                     the hurt you're causing. Maybe
                     this is all just some big game of
                     pretend to you, but I need you to
                     understand. Walter is...he's all I
                     have, he's everything to me, and
                     every day we lose because of this
                     puts him further away from where I
                     can help him.
                         (beat)
                     Whatever the police think, whatever
                     the world thinks, we know the truth,
                     don't we? We both know you're not
                     Walter. Getting you to admit that
                     may be the only chance I have to
                     straighten this out before it's too
                     late. Maybe you're afraid of getting
                     in trouble, that you're in too deep.
                     But you're not. You don't have to
                     tell me who you are, you just have
                     to tell them who you're not. Just...
                     tell them the truth.
          
          He doesn't respond. She gives it a moment in case he might
          open up, then rises and heads back into the hallway. She
          switches off the light and heads off down the hallway.
          
                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

          Pastor Briegleb is typing out his sermon for the day. He's
          exhausted. Looks at the clock. 6:30 a.m. He rubs tiredly
          at his face when he HEARS the THUMP of the newspaper being
          delivered. He stands, stretches and steps out to --
          
          EXT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- where the newspaper is visible on the front lawn. He picks
          it up and starts into the rectory as he unfolds the paper.
          
          Then: he slows, stunned by something he's reading.   He looks
          up again, and hurries back into the rectory.

          She's in bed, asleep, as the telephone RINGS downstairs. She
          glances at the clock: 6:45. She clearly doesn't want to go
          down to answer it...then reluctantly climbs out of bed.

                     breakfast. I think we should meet.
          
          She starts to reply, but the line goes dead. She hangs up
          the phone, pulls her robe closer around her, and steps out to
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN
          where a copy of the Los Angeles Times sits on a neighbor's
          front lawn. She looks around, then dashes to pick it up.
          She unfolds it as she heads back, then abruptly stops. She
          can't believe what she's seeing.
          
          CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER. The headline reads Mysterious

                     Noticed since the return of the boy
                     to his mother. Not only does it
                     state clearly that you are the boy's
                     mother, one could infer from this
                     that you are somehow responsible
                     for these changes...and that the
                     police are concerned for the boy's
                     welfare in your hands.

                               DR. TARR
                     -- and it's clear that he has
                     something to tell. I'm sure that
                     in time he will give his boyish
                     story of the entire affair, but not
                     until he has faith in his listener.
                     And that is what is lacking: faith
                     in the poor lad's story. In the
                     course of my examination, I found
                     nothing to dispute the findings by
                     the LAPD.
          
                               REPORTER
                     How come he hasn't been able to
                     tell anyone what happened while he
                     was gone?

                     I would say that the boy has either
                     been coached or questioned to a
                     point where he is largely confused
                     about what happened to him during

                       those many months. It's possible
                       that his mental lapse may be the
                       result of a blow to the head or a
                       sudden shock which brought about a
                       possible cranial injury. I believe
                       that this condition will pass soon.
                       Until then, I recommend that the
                       police department continue working
                       with him, exposing him to whatever
                       elements of his previous life as
                       may help restore his memory.

                     When Chief Davis took over the LAPD
                     two years ago, he said --

                     We will hold court on gunmen in the
                     Los Angeles streets. I want them
                     brought in dead, not alive, and I
                     will reprimand any officer who shows

          A crowd of police officers, armed with machine-guns, BLAST

                     He picked fifty of the most dangerous
                     cops on the force, gave them machine
                     guns and permission to shoot anyone
                     who got in their way. He called
                     them the Gun Squad. No lawyers.
                     No trials. No questions, suspensions
                     or investigations. Just piles of
                     bodies.

                     Bodies in morgues, bodies in
                     hospitals, bodies by the side of
                     the road, barely alive. Not because
                     the police wanted to wipe out crime,
                     they just wanted to get rid of the
                     competition.

                     fun, after all.

                       Your son's upper front teeth were
                       separated by a small muscle. Made
                       them sit about an eighth of an inch
                       apart. The boy in that room has no
                       such gap.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       Does a gap like that get smaller
                       with age? Because that's what
                       they'll say.
          
                                 DR. MONTGOMERY
                       In some cases, yes, it's possible.
                       But the muscle between Walter's
                       teeth prevents that from happening.
                       They can never come together without
                       an operation to sever the muscle,
                       and I can tell you right now that
                       he has never had such an operation.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       Will you be willing to sign a letter
                       saying that officially?
          
                                 DR. MONTGOMERY
                       Pardon my language, but...hell,
                       yes.
          
          He hears an OS moan from the inner office.
          
                                  DR. MONTGOMERY
                       Sounds like the anesthetic is wearing
                       off.
                            (starts in, pauses)
                       On the other hand, maybe I'll write
                       that letter first. Give the little
                       fella something to think about.
          He smiles.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING
          
          Small, with wooden desks, chalkboard, all the basics. "Walter"
          stands in front of MRS. FOX, fifties, wearing severe glasses
          and an equally severe expression. Christine stands nearby.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       Well? What do you think? Is that
                       the Walter Collins that you remember?
          
                                 MRS. FOX
                       If it is, he's changed enormously.
                           (to "Walter")

                                "WALTER"
                      You're a teacher.
          
                                MRS. FOX
                      Yes, but even teachers have names.
                      What's mine?
          
                                "WALTER"
                      I don't remember. I know you, but
                      I don't remember your name.
          
                                 MRS. FOX
                      My name is Mrs. Fox.   Now, take
                      your seat.
          
          "Walter" hesitates, then takes a seat.    The other kids laugh.
          
                                MRS. FOX
                      I didn't say take a seat. I said
                      take your seat. Your assigned seat.
                      You must know which one it is, you
                      sat there for over a year.
          
          "Walter" tries another vacant seat. There are only three
          vacant seats in the room. More laughter from the kids.
          
                                MRS. FOX
                      Try again. Here's a hint: There's
                      only one more empty seat left.
          
          He sits.   Mrs. Fox looks to Christine.
          
                                MRS. FOX
                      Mrs. Collins, if that's your son,
                      I'll eat my yardstick. Not only
                      will I put that in writing, I'll
                      swear to it in a court of law and
                      in front of President Calvin Coolidge
                      himself if I have to.
          
          For the first time, Christine allows a hopeful smile.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The lights are low. Christine sits on the floor, sorting
          through a box containing artifacts of affection: class projects
          made by Walter, trees and houses and clay dogs; a heart-shaped
          card Mother's Day card, hand-made, with I Love You, Mommy
          carefully printed on the front. She runs her finger over it,
          tracing the impression left by his pencil.
          
          She starts to cry, and a tear falls onto the pencil drawing.
          She frantically dabs at it, trying to preserve it from
          distortion...then sets it down and covers her face, weeping.

          EXT. CITY HALL - MORNING (RAIN)
          
          A cold, wet knot of reporters and photographers are waiting
          in the rain on the steps to City Hall. Christine sits in a
          car with Briegleb, looking at it all.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: SEPTEMBER 6, 1928
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     I'll see you tonight at eight for
                     my broadcast. I'll leave the back
                     door open and a light on. Good
                     luck.
          
          She nods, exits the car and walks up the steps to the front
          of City Hall as he drives off. She stands before the press,
          looks at them for a moment, then begins.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Good morning. My name is Christine
                     Collins. On March 10th, my nine
                     year old son, Walter Collins,
                     disappeared. A four month
                     investigation resulted in a boy
                     being brought to Los Angeles from
                     De Kalb, Illinois. They told me,
                     and all of you, that this boy was
                     my son. They were wrong.
                         (beat)
                     The Los Angeles Police Department
                     made a mistake...a terrible mistake.
                     The boy they found is not my son.
                     That is the reason for the supposed
                     "transformation." I have letters
                     from his dentist, his teachers and
                     others confirming that this boy is
                     not my son. The letters are being
                     reprinted now, and I should have
                     them for you tomorrow.
          
          Flashbulbs pop, dazzling her.    She composes herself.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     I have given the police department
                     every opportunity to admit their
                     mistake and renew the search for my
                     son. Since they have refused to do
                     so, I have no choice but to present
                     my case before the public. I hope
                     this will persuade the police to
                     finish the job they started, and
                     bring my son home to me.
                         (beat)
                     Thank you.

          As the reporters start to shout out questions, we PAN ACROSS
          to a BEAT COP who has been watching. He goes quickly to a
          police call-box, unlocks it and picks up the telephone.
          
          INT. LINCOLN HEIGHTS STATION - DAY
          
          The glass door to Captain Jones' office is closed, but we can
          SEE him on the phone. Finally, he hangs up and comes out of
          the office. His tone is cold but neutral...we think this
          could go either way. He stops an officer.
          
                               JONES
                     Morelli, I want you to find the
                     Collins woman and get her here.
                     Bring her in the back way, and have
                     a couple of matrons standing by.
          
                                 1ST COP
                     Yes, sir.
          
          He heads off as Jones goes into his office, closing the door.
          
          EXT. LINCOLN HEIGHT STATION - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY (RAIN)
          
          A police car pulls up to the curb, and Christine and "Walter"
          emerge from the back seat. They dash through the rain to the
          back door, followed by the 1st Cop.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Why are we using the back door?

                     Captain's orders.     Front's jammed
                     with reporters.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                     Is it?
          She allows a moment of quiet satisfaction as she's led into
          
          INT. STATION - BULLPEN
          
          where she's directed to a wooden bench. A nearby clock reads
          3:45. She sits, "Walter" silent beside her. In the BG, the
          Desk Sergeant puts a call on hold.

          Ybarra takes the call as Jones' calls from his office.

                     Mrs. Collins.
          
          Christine starts to take "Walter's" hand when a matron appears.
          
                                JONES
                     Leave the boy for now.   We'll look
                     after him.
          
          She hands "Walter" over to the matron, then enters
          
          INT. JONES' OFFICE
          
          He leaves the door open and indicates for Christine to sit.
          She does. He paces, working up to what he's going to do.
          
                               JONES
                     You've put us through quite a bit
                     of trouble, Mrs. Collins. This
                     situation has become an embarrassment
                     for the entire department.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     It wasn't my intention to embarrass
                     anyone.
                               JONES
                     No, of course not. You just told
                     the papers we can't tell one boy
                     from another as a compliment for
                     the months we spent working on your
                     case. Are you trying to make fools
                     out of us? Is that it? Do you
                     enjoy this?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, of course not. I had to get
                     your attention, I had to make you
                     understand...he's not my son.
          
          He circles, closing in on her. She becomes aware that the
          door is open, and he's doing this for the benefit of anyone
          who might be listening in.

                     You know what your problem is? You
                     want to shirk your responsibilities
                     as a mother. You enjoyed being a
                     free woman, didn't you? Enjoyed
                     not having to worry about a young
                     son. You could do what you wanted,
                     go where you wanted, see anyone you
                     wanted. But then we found your
                     son. Brought him back. And now
                     he's an inconvenience. That's why
                     you cooked up this whole scheme, to
                     try and throw him to the state, let
                     the state raise him for you.

                     That's not true!
          
                               JONES
                     No? Even the boy says he's your
                     son. Why would he do that? How
                     would he know to do that?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't know! All I know is that
                     he's lying!
          
                               JONES
                     Maybe so. Maybe he is a liar. But
                     that's how he's been trained, isn't
                     it? Lying was born in both of you.
                     You're a liar and a troublemaker
                     and if you ask me you've got no
                     business walking the streets of Los
                     Angeles.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Just a minute --
                               JONES
                     Because either you know you're lying,
                     or you're not capable of knowing if
                     you're lying or telling the truth.
                     So which is it, Mrs. Collins? Are
                     you a derelict mother? Or just
                     nuts? Because from where I sit,
                     those are the only options.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I'm not going to sit here and take
                     this --
          
          Jones stands between her and the door.

                               JONES
                     You want to bring in experts?
                     Doctors? Well, I can do that too.
                         (calling OS)
                     Matron?
          
          The door opens, and a POLICE MATRON enters. He looks back to
          Christine, his voice low, his anger replaced by cool
          determination. This scene is about to take an abrupt change.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins...do you still insist
                     that the boy out there is not your
                     son?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes.
          
          He nods to the matron, who moves to restrain her.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Wait...what are you doing?
          
          The Matron cuffs Christine's hands behind her back.
          
                               MATRON
                     Please don't struggle, ma'am.   You'll
                     only hurt yourself.
          
          A CLICK, and the handcuffs are in place.
          
                               JONES
                         (to the matron)
                     You are to convey the prisoner to
                     the Los Angeles County General
                     Hospital Psychopathic Ward.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No...wait, you can't --

                     she has been deceived by police and
                     others, and that they have given
                     her a boy and tried to make her
                     think it is her son when she says
                     it is not.
          
          EXT. REAR OF POLICE STATION (MONTAGE)
          
          Christine is led, in handcuffs, into a waiting police van.

                               JONES (V.O.)
                     Mrs. Collins has been known to us
                     since about March 10, 1928, when
                     she reported her nine-year-old son
                     Walter missing.
          
          INT. VAN
          
          A stunned and dazed Christine rides in the back of the van
          
                               JONES (V.O.)
                     The boy was gone until July, 1928.
                     Since his return, she has complained
                     that he is still missing, and has
                     made repeated requests that he be
                     found, saying, "This is not my
                     Walter," even though positive
                     identification has been established.
          
          EXT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          The police van enters the hospital at 1200 North State Street.
          
          INT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - DAY
          
          A sterile, dreary, white-on-white place where in the
          background, we can HEAR the sounds of the insane crying out.
          The matron leads a stunned Christine to the front desk.
          
                               JONES (V.O.)
                     She suffers from paranoia, delusions
                     of persecution, and dislocation
                     from reality. She may be a threat
                     to herself or others. We recommend
                     that she be conveyed to the
                     psychopathic ward for treatment and
                     observation until her senses can be
                     restored.
          The matron stops before the desk.   The NURSE barely looks up.
          
                               MATRON

                     Wait...please, this is a mistake.

                               CHRISTINE
                         (forced calm)
                     Please...you have to listen to me.
                     The police are doing this to punish
                     me. They tried to force this boy
                     on me and tell me he was my son,
                     but it wasn't my son, and now they
                     say I'm crazy --
          
          She stops, noting the looks exchanged between the nurse and
          the matron. Her story sounds insane, even to her. She begins
          to realize the depth of her predicament.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Oh, god...oh god, please, no....
          
                               NURSE
                     If you continue to struggle I'll
                     have to put you in a straitjacket.
                     Do you want that?
                         (she shakes head)
                     Good. Then behave yourself.
                         (to orderlies)
                     Code twelve.
          
          The matron turns Christine over to two large male ORDERLIES,
          who take her by the arms and lead her into the psycho ward.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, please, you have to listen to
                     me...wait...please!
          
          They force-march her down the hall, the screams of the insane
          growing louder, falling deeper into the nightmare.
          INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM
          
          Christine is ushered into the room by a NURSE.
          
                               NURSE
                     Take off your clothes.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Why?
          
                               NURSE

                     for all new patients.
          
          The nurse begins putting on a pair of rubber gloves.

                               CHRISTINE
                     That's not necessary --
          
                               NURSE
                     You can remove your clothes yourself,
                     or I can have the orderlies do it
                     for you. Which do you prefer?
          
          Reluctantly, Christine begins to remove her clothes.
          
          INT. SHOWER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          ON CHRISTINE'S FACE as she stands in a spray of water and
          disinfectant, some coming from the showerhead above, some
          from a hose sprayed on her by the Nurse in BG. Christine's
          eyes are closed, trying to shut out the sense of violation.
          
                               NURSE
                     Spread your legs.
                         (a beat)
                     Wider.
          
          Biting her lip, Christine complies.
          
          INT. HALL - LATER
          
          Wet hair plastered to her face, dressed in a hospital gown,
          Christine is led down a long hall by the Nurse. As she passes
          the closed doors, we HEAR women weeping, talking to themselves,
          crying out, screaming, beating on the walls. Fingers poke
          through narrow viewing slits in the doors.
          
          The Nurse pulls out a key-ring and unlocks one of the doors.
          
                                NURSE
                     Inside.
          
          Christine enters --
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Bare, forbidding, four white walls and a narrow slit of a
          window. It's a two-person room. Sitting on the other bed is
          another PATIENT.
          
                               NURSE
                     This is your room. The doctor's
                     left for the day. He'll see you in

                               CHRISTINE
                     Then if I could just use the phone.
          
                               NURSE
                     Phone privileges are earned by good
                     behavior. You're not allowed
                     newspapers, magazines, radio, books

                     own good.
          
          The Nurse exits, closing and locking the door.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Wait...please! There's been a
                     terrible mistake!
          
          Nothing. She's alone with the other Patient, who doesn't
          much like the noise and disturbance.
          
                               PATIENT
                     My room. My room.       They SAID it
                     was MY ROOM!

                     ROOM!
          
          She starts SCREAMING.    Christine covers her ears.
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
          We slowly PULL AWAY from the narrow window, and the sound of
          screaming, into the late afternoon rain and growing darkness.
          
                                                        CUT TO:
          
          EXT. OLD ROAD - EARLY EVENING
          
          A lone truck sits beside the road, hood open, steam coming
          from the radiator.
          
          GORDON NORTHCOTT, thirties, thin and angular, finishes working
          on the car as a police car approaches. The detective we saw
          earlier, Ybarra, is inside. He rolls down the window.
          
                                  YBARRA
                     Problem?

                               YBARRA
                     Listen, could you give me a hand?
                     I'm trying to find a place called
                     the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.
          
          As he answers, Gordon moves casually to the back of the open
          truck to get a rag to wipe his hands. There is a GUN on the
          floor of the trunk. Gordon picks it up inside the rag.
          
                               GORDON
                     Northcott Ranch...oh yeah. You're

                     about two, three miles. Then the
                     next right. That'll bring you right
                     to it. Something going on?
          
                               YBARRA
                     Just looking into a juvenile matter.
                     Thanks for the help.
          
          Ybarra drives away. As soon as he's out of sight, Gordon
          slams the hood, runs to the driver's side and starts the truck,
          still steaming. He drives off as fast as he can.
          
          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - EVENING
          
          A long, low house, stonework and brick and wood, behind a
          large open area cluttered with junked cars. At the far end
          of the open area is a chicken coop, about fifteen feet long.
          Ybarra drives up in front of the house, gets out, looks around.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Hello?
          ANOTHER ANGLE - POV SHOT
          
          Someone is watching as Ybarra moves toward the main house.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Anybody home?
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Ybarra glances off to a rustling SOUND, and follows it to
          
          EXT. CHICKEN COOP
          
          A few chickens inside, held back by wire. An ax is nearby,
          its stained edge buried in an old wooden stump. A corner of
          the coop seems to have come down and been crudely repaired.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                      56.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          As suddenly someone runs across the dirt yard into the house,
          SLAMMING the door. Ybarra runs to the porch, tries the door.
          Locked from the inside. He pounds on the door.
          
                                YBARRA
                      This is the police. I have a warrant
                      for a minor named Sanford Clark.
                      Open the door and stand aside.
          
          No reply.   He braces himself and KICKS open the door.
          
          INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN
          
          The door BANGS against the wall. Flies buzz around the place.
          The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a
          mess. Ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen. No sound
          except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters
          
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Old, musty, shadowed. The ticking of an old grandfather clock.
          There's no one in sight. Ybarra moves down the hall, glances
          into two adjoining rooms. Nothing. He continues into
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world.
          Ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then STOPS at a creak of
          wood from a CLOSET. He moves toward it. Pauses. Reaches
          for the doorknob...as suddenly a clock CHIMES loudly and the
          closet explodes outward and --
          
          -- SANFORD CLARK, 15, runs out. He slams into Ybarra, knocking
          him down. They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on
          the floor as Sanford tries to escape.
                                YBARRA
                      Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your
                      face through the floor!
          
          Breathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling.   Ybarra
          cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back.
          
                                YBARRA
                      On your feet.
          
          Sanford stands, and as Ybarra leads him out, we PAN TO a mantle
          and a photo that shows Sanford Clark and a man we recognize
          as the one we saw by the road earlier: Gordon Northcott.
          
          INT. YBARRA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Ybarra locks Sanford in the car, then climbs in the driver's
          side. He checks a cut on his face in the rear-view mirror.

                               YBARRA
                     Jesus...what the hell's wrong with
                     you? Don't you know assaulting a
                     cop is against the law?
          
                               SANFORD
                     What difference does it make now?
          
                                YBARRA
                     We're just sending you back to
                     Canada, son, it isn't the end of
                     the world.
          
                               SANFORD
                     What?
          
                               YBARRA
                     You can't just stay in the U.S. as
                     long as you want, pal. We've got a
                     orders to send you back home, and --
          
          Suddenly Sanford starts laughing. It's a nearly hysterical
          laugh, half fear and half relief...Ybarra isn't there for the
          reasons he thought. Ybarra is puzzled by his reaction.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Didn't know Canada was that funny.
          
          Ybarra puts the car into gear and drives off.

                     No word from Mrs. Collins?

                     Get on down to her house, make sure
                     she's all right. If she's not there,
                     call the LAPD, see what they know.
          
          The aide hurries off as Briegleb turns back to the microphone
          and touches a switch. The ON THE AIR lamp glows to life.

          Christine is in bed, wide awake, the sounds of the asylum
          somewhat lessened now. Her face is dimly lit by moonlight.
          
                               BRIEGLEB (V.O.)
                     I had hoped to have a guest with us
                     tonight, but apparently she has
                     been delayed. Since she can't be
                     here to tell you what she told the
                     press this afternoon, I'll fill in
                     the best I can. I'm going to tell
                     you what happened, and I'm going to
                     keep telling you right here, every
                     night...until someone does something
                     about it.

          Gordon Northcott makes his way to the ticket booth.
          
                               GORDON
                     I'd like a ticket to Canada. Alberta
                     or Vancouver, whatever's leaving
                     tonight.
          
                               TICKET VENDER
                     Don't have anything going that far
                     tonight. Best I can do is put you
                     on a train for Seattle. From there
                     you can transfer to one of the locals
                     or drive across the border.
          
                               GORDON
                     That'll be fine.
                               TICKET VENDER
                     Round-trip?
          
                                  GORDON
                     One way.
          
          The vender moves away to pull the ticket. Gordon glances at
          a cop heading his way. Stiffens. The cop continues past
          him. Gordon relaxes as the vender slides the ticket across.
          
                               TICKET VENDER
                     That'll be fifteen dollars.
          
          Gordon pays for the ticket and heads toward the boarding gates.

          Christine is on top of the bed, eyes open, not having slept
          all night. She's staring at the woman on the next cot. THe
          woman is staring back at her. The second-hand on a clock
          behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud BELL
          goes off, announcing the start of the day.
          
          We hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall. Christine
          stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in
          the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown...
          looking like someone who actually belongs in this place.
          
          The door opens and she steps into the hall as a NURSE passes.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Can I see the doctor?   Or someone
                     in charge --

                                NURSE
                     Down the hall. The doctor will
                     call for you when he's ready.

                     Go or stay, either way I lock the

          Christine doesn't want to stay, so she moves off.
          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DINING AREA - MORNING
          
          Christine and the other patients sit at long tables. A few
          talk in quiet whispers, but most eat silently, staring vacantly
          ahead. Some have scars showing lobotomies or electro-
          convulsive (shock) therapy. It's a scary bunch. Christine
          isn't eating.
          
          Another female patient, CAROL DEXTER, thirties, watches
          Christine then slides closer. A BEAT, then:
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     You should eat. Eating is normal.
                     You got to do everything you can to
                     look normal. That's the only chance
                     you've got. Besides, you'll need

          Christine is startled by the level-headedness of the advice
          from someone she assumed was probably nuts. Reluctantly, she
          begins eating the cold-looking oatmeal.

                     Finish it all.    I know it's hard,
                     but you have to   try. Lunch isn't

                     I won't be here that long. As soon
                     as I can talk to a doctor, they'll
                     realize there's been a terrible

                               CAROL DEXTER
                     Yeah, that always works.
                         (beat, quieter)
                     I heard them talking. You're here
                     on a code twelve, police action.
                     The doctors, the staff, they figure
                     that if the police sent you here,
                     there must be a good reason for it.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Then I'll just have to prove that
                     I'm not insane.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     Yeah? How? The more you try to
                     act sane, the crazier you start to
                     look. If you smile too much, you're
                     delusional or stifling hysteria.
                     If you don't smile, you're depressed.
                     If you're neutral you're emotionally
                     withdrawn and potentially catatonic.

                     When she tried to tell somebody,
                     they sent her here. And that one?
                     The police beat the crap out of her
                     brother, broke both his arms. When
                     she complained to the papers, they
                     picked her up and...
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     What about you?
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     I...work nights.
                         (Chris doesn't get it)
                     I mean, I work nights. Downtown.
                     In some of the clubs. You know.
          
          It gets through.   Hooker.   Christine nods.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     This one client started hitting me,
                     and he wouldn't stop. So I filed a
                     complaint. Turns out he was a cop.
                     Next thing I know, I'm here.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     But how can they --
          
                                CAROL DEXTER
                     You're kidding right? Hey, everybody
                     knows women are fragile, right?
                     They're all emotions, no logic,
                     nothin' goin' on upstairs. And
                     sometimes, like when they say
                     something that's a little, y'know,
                     inconvenient...they just go fucking
                     nuts, pardon my French. If we're
                     insane, nobody has to listen to us.
                     I mean, who are you going to believe,
                     some crazy woman trying to destroy
                     the integrity of the force, or a
                     police officer? Then once they get
                     us in here, we either learn to
                     behave, and shut up, or --
                         (beat)
                     Or you don't go home...or you go
                     home like that.

          She nods to an older woman whose upper temples are marred by
          surgical scars. Lobotomized. Christine turns away.
          
                                CAROL DEXTER
                      Better finish up your oatmeal.
                      Want to look sane for the doctors.
                      Then I want to hear what they nailed
                      you for.
          
          Numb with horror, Christine forces down the oatmeal.
          
          INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - DAY
          
          Sanford Clark sits near several other juveniles being held.
          Pensive, nervous, he watches a kid absently tapping a ruler
          against his knees.
          
          FEATURE the ruler.   Rising.   Falling.   Tapping.   Then back --
          
          -- on Sanford as we hear it continuing to tap OS.     PUSH IN ON
          his face. Then, suddenly --
          
          FLASHBACK
          
          -- on a HATCHET, rising and falling in tune with the ruler
          tapping. There's blood on the hatchet.
          
          Gordon Northcott's eyes glitter insanely as he brings the
          hatchet down again and just as it comes right AT US we flash --
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          As Sanford CRIES OUT with the memory. We PULL BACK to see
          the others in the room staring at him. He turns away, won't
          meet their gaze. Something's terribly wrong.
          
          Just then, an ADMINISTRATOR comes in.
                                ADMINISTRATOR
                      Clark...Sanford Clark.
          
          Sanford rises, goes to the Administrator.
          
                                ADMINISTRATOR
                      Paperwork's come through. You'll
                      be deported back to Canada day after
                      tomorrow. The police there will to
                      decide what to do with you next. I
                      hope your stay here has convinced
                      you not to try crossing the border
                      illegally in future.
          
          He starts to turn and walk away when:

                               SANFORD
                     Wait, I...I want to talk to the
                     officer who brought me in.
          
                               ADMINISTRATOR
                     I'm sure he has far more important
                     things to do than --
          
                                SANFORD
                     Please.   It's important.
          
          The Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled.
          
                               ADMINISTRATOR
                     He's off-duty until tomorrow, but...
                     I'll see what I can do. No promises.
          
          And with that, the administrator heads away.
          
          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON
          
          Gordon Northcott is hitch-hiking by the side of the road. A
          truck approaches, passes him...then slows and stops. Gordon
          runs up to the truck as the DRIVER leans out.
          
                               DRIVER
                     How far you going?

                                  DRIVER
                     Hop in.
          
          Gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under
          the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. He lifts
          out a short length of metal pipe.
                               DRIVER
                     Don't worry about that, pal. Just
                     a little insurance. A couple of
                     guys tried to hijack my truck a few
                     years ago so they could run booze
                     over the border. You can't be too
                     safe, you know?
          
                               GORDON
                     Yeah, I surely do.
          
          Gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly
          SLAMS it DOWN on the Driver's head...over and over and over.
          Blood splatters his face. Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the
          Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off.

          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Wearing a bandage on one arm, Christine is escorted down the
          hall by one of the nurses. She's led into --
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- where DOCTOR JONATHAN STEELE stands as Christine enters.
          He's in his fifties, heavy-set, serious.
          
                               STEELE
                     Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele.
                     Please, have a seat.
          
          The nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs
          in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair.
          Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane.
          
                               STEELE
                     I hope your stay has been comfortable
                     so far.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Fine.   Thank you.
          
                               STEELE
                     Really? I'd think it would be quite
                     difficult at first.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                         (catching herself)
                     Well, it was. Difficult, I mean.
                     But comfortable.
          
          He makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going
          well. He motions to the bandage on her arm.
          
                               STEELE
                     I see they took a blood test.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Wasserman Test. To check for
                     syphilis. Apparently it can affect
                     the mind.
          
                               STEELE
                     The idea that someone thinks you
                     should be checked for syphilis...did
                     that upset you?

                     But...at the same time...I imagine
                     that it would be...would probably
                     be upsetting to...some people that

          She flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks
          up the report on his desk, glances it over.
          
                               STEELE
                     According to your file, you believe
                     the police have substituted a fake
                     boy for your son. Is that true?
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     I didn't say they substituted a fake
                     boy, just...not the right boy.
                         (beat)
                     They brought back the wrong boy.
                     Not my son. He's still missing.
          
          He starts pulling out papers from his file.
          
                               STEELE
                     That's strange...you see, I have
                     here a newspaper article with a
                     photo of you at the train station,
                     welcoming your son home. That is
                     you in the photo, isn't it?

                                STEELE
                     So at first he was your son, but

                     That's right.
          
          He nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to
          hear. It's a chess match that ends with:
          
                                STEELE
                     That's odd, because according to
                     the head nurse, when you were
                     admitted you accused the police of
                     conspiring to do this deliberately,
                     to punish you. So either she and
                     the interns are also conspiring
                     against you...or you're changing
                     your story.

          He sits back.    Christine's face tells the story.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          A single table, two chairs. Sanford sits quietly, nervously,
          as Ybarra hangs his wet coat up on a hook.

                               YBARRA
                     It's raining cats, dogs and democrats
                     out there, so this better be worth
                     it.
          
          He sits across the table from Sanford, lights up a cigarette.
          Sanford's mouth works for a moment, but nothing comes out.
          
                                YBARRA
                     Well?
          
                               SANFORD
                     Look, I -- this isn't easy, okay?
          
                               YBARRA
                     Nothing is.
          
          A long BEAT.   Sanford composes himself, begins:
          
                               SANFORD
                     My cousin's Gordon Northcott. He
                     owns the ranch where you found me.
                     He let me live there in exchange
                     for watching the place when he was
                     gone, doing chores, stuff like that.
                     Said I could stay on as long as I
                     wanted to. I figured that also
                     meant I could leave whenever I wanted
                     to, but he wouldn't let me.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Are you saying he held you prisoner?
                         (sanford nods)
                     Bull. When I got to the ranch you
                     were running around free as a
                     jaybird. Could've left any time
                     you wanted. So what's this, some
                     kind of story to cover why you were
                     in the country illegally?
          
                               SANFORD
                     No...no, it's nothing like that.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Because I don't have time for --
          
                               SANFORD
                     Listen to me, please.    He said --
          
                                YBARRA
                     What?   What did he --
          
                               SANFORD
                     He said that if I tried to leave,
                     he'd kill me!

                               SANFORD (Cont'd)
                     You don't understand, you don't
                     know what he's like, what he...what
                     we did...what he made me do.
          
          Sanford is in tears by now. Ybarra realizes that there's
          something real going on here, and backs off.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Okay, lets start at the beginning.
                     What did he make you do?
          
          Sanford closes his eyes.    Takes a long beat.   Finally....
          
                               SANFORD
                     Him and me...me and Gordon, we...
                         (beat, softly)
                     ...we killed some kids.
          
          Ybarra freezes, the cigarette not moving in his hand.
          
                               SANFORD
                     I didn't mean to, I swear...he made
                     me help him, said if I didn't he'd
                     kill me, too. Please, you gotta
                     help me...I'm scared...I don't want
                     to go to Hell for killing kids.
          
                                  YBARRA
                     What kids?
          
                               SANFORD
                     I don't know...I never knew their
                     names.
          
                               YBARRA
                     How many kids?
                               SANFORD
                     All together?
          
          He thinks about it for a moment. The fact that he has to add
          them all up is almost as chilling as what follows next.
          
                               SANFORD
                     About...twenty, I guess.
          
                               YBARRA
                     You're lying.
          
                               SANFORD
                     No, it's true, I swear!
          
                               YBARRA
                     Twenty kids.

                               SANFORD
                     Yeah...thereabouts...I kinda stopped
                     counting after a while, and Gordon
                     said one or two might've gotten
                     away, but --
          
                               YBARRA
                     Nobody can just up and kill twenty
                     kids --
          
                               SANFORD
                     We did...yeah, we did that....
          
                               YBARRA
                     How?
          
          Sanford looks off, pauses, then, softly and slowly....
          
                               SANFORD
                     Most times we'd bring back just one
                     or two...sometimes as many as three.
          
          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - DAY
          
          Gordon is at his truck, the same one we saw earlier, checking
          the engine as Sanford looks on nervously.
          
                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     I always knew when he was getting
                     ready 'cause he'd go through the
                     car and clean it up, make sure the
                     tires were good, the engine...he
                     was always afraid something'd break
                     down and we'd be caught.
          
          Gordon slams the hood shut, looks to Sanford.    Smiles.
          
                               GORDON
                     Time to go.
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          A kid is walking down the street, playing idly, by himself,
          as the truck starts to approach from behind.
          
                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     We'd go a different direction every
                     time, never hit the same part of
                     town twice. Sometimes we'd go for
                     hours, just driving around, until
                     we found somebody.
          
          The truck comes beside the kid and Gordon leans out the window.

                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     He'd use all kinds of different
                     stories. Sometimes he'd say he had
                     free tickets for the circus, or he
                     was looking for a lost dog...that
                     one worked real good. Other days --
          
                               GORDON
                     There you are, we've been looking
                     for you like mad.
          
          FLASH-IMAGE: to a different kid, a different street.
          
                                  KID
                     You have?
          
                               GORDON
                     Sure thing. Your folks, they got
                     in an accident. They sent us to
                     find you. They're hurt real bad.
                     The police took 'em to the hospital,
                     but they didn't have time to come
                     find you, so we said we'd do it.
                     Now come on, hurry...we gotta get
                     to the hospital, see your folks.
          
          FLASH-IMAGE: Yet another kid, who hesitates, looks to Sanford.
          
                                SANFORD (V.O.)
                     A lot of kids won't get in a car
                     alone with a stranger, but when
                     he's got a kid there with him, that
                     made it easier.
                         (beat)
                     They'd look to me, and figure if I
                     was safe, they would be too. That's
                     why he needed me, see?
                                  SANFORD
                     It's okay.     Come on in.
          
          FLASH-IMAGE: Back to the first kid, who takes one last BEAT,
          then gets into the car.
          
                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     Every time they got in the truck,
                     it was like I wanted to die.
          
                               GORDON
                     Good boy! Now hold on, it's a long
                     drive and we gotta fly.
          
          And the truck heads off.

                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     Then, as soon as we got back to the
                     ranch...they went in the coop.
          
          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT
          
          The boy, crying, is tossed into the chicken coop.   There are
          two other boys there, also crying and screaming.
          
                                SANFORD (V.O.)
                     Some days he'd do 'em right off.
                     Other days, he'd wait, pick up a
                     few more, keep 'em in the coop until
                     he had like four or five, 'cause --
                         (beat)
                     -- 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream
                     all at once. Like they were some
                     kinda chorus. And then....
          
          QUICK IMAGES
          
          Gordon, eyes insane with blood lust, stumbles toward the coop.
          
                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     ...and then....
          
          The kids, screaming.
          
          Sanford looking on, afraid to move, the single overhead light
          in the coop swinging wildly.
          
          Gordon grabbing an ax.    Raising it.
          
          On Sanford's eyes, terrified.
          
          The ax begins to fall in SLOW MOTION and --
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          -- as the long ash at the end of Ybarra's cigarette, TUMBLES
          to the floor in SLOW MOTION, end over end, SHATTERING when it
          hits the floor and bringing us back to full speed.
          
                                SANFORD
                     Sometimes...sometimes he'd leave
                     one or two of 'em alive...barely
                     anyway...and tell me...finish 'em.
                     Finish 'em...or I'll finish you.
                         (beat)
                     And I did...I did...oh god...oh,
                     sweet Jesus...I killed 'em...I killed
                     'em...I killed 'em....
          
          Then: silence, except for Sanford's sobbing. Ybarra realizes
          he hasn't been breathing. He tries to find his voice.

                     think...if you saw them again, do
                     you think you'd recognize them?
                         (sanford nods)
                     Just a second.
          
          He goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing
          kids bound with a rubber band. Hands it to Sanford.
          
                                YBARRA
                     I haven't updated these in a while,
                     but still, it should be....
                         (beat)
                     Just go through...and if you see
                     any faces you recognize, put it on
                     the table.
          
          Sanford takes the photos.   Starts going through them.
          
          A photo, a face, goes down on the table. Then another. A
          third. With each photo slapped down the SLAP gets louder,
          BOOMING at us. Another photo. Another. Row after row.
          He's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos.
          
          Then he SLAMS down the last one and   half-falls, half-stumbles
          out of his chair, sobbing...goes to   the corner of the room
          and slides down the wall until he's   sitting in a fetal
          position, hands covering his face.    Sobbing uncontrollably.
          
          Numb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. Looks at
          it. Turns it over to the name, then picks up another. Then
          a third. When he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over,
          he stops, staring at it.
          
                               YBARRA
                     ...shit....
          The name on the back of the photo is WALTER COLLINS.
          
                               JONES (V.O.)
                     He's lying.
          
          INT. JONES' OFFICE - DAY
          
          Jones is on the phone, pissed and getting more pissed by the
          moment. INTERCUT between Jones and Ybarra in juvenile hall
          during the conversation.
          
                               JONES
                     Have you gone soft in the head,
                     Les?
          
                                 YBARRA
                     Sir, I --
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                      73.
          
          
                               JONES
                     He's playing you! He knows he's in
                     trouble, so he's come up with some
                     cock and bull story about how he
                     was forced to stay in the country --
          
                               YBARRA
                     With all due respect, sir, I don't
                     think so. You didn't see him, the
                     kid's scared half out of his mind --
          
                                JONES
                     He picked the Collins kid! We found
                     him, remember? Haven't you been
                     reading the papers?
                         (beat)
                     Or maybe you have, is that it?
          
          He backhands a newspaper on his desk, headlined DISTRAUGHT
          MOTHER CLAIMS POLICE RETURNED WRONG CHILD.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Sir, if you'd just listen --
          
          Just then a secretary sticks her head in the doorway.
          
                               SECRETARY
                     I'm sorry, captain, but he's here
                     again...that reverend, Briegleb.
                     He's asking about Christine Collins.
          
                                JONES
                     Tell the sonofabitch to get the
                     hell off police property before I
                     have him arrested for disturbing
                     the peace.
          
                               SECRETARY
                     I tried. He said he's not leaving...
                     him, or his friends.
          
          There's a disturbance off-screen and she goes to deal with it
          as Jones gets further wound up to ninety.
          
                               JONES
                     What the hell...?
          
          He's drawn to the window by the sound of voices. He peeks
          through the slats. Several dozen placard-carrying parishioners
          and members of the Women's Temperance League are standing in
          the street, beating drums and calling Christine's name.
          
                               JONES
                     Jesus jumped down....
          
          He realizes he's still on the phone.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                     74.
          
          
                               JONES
                     Ybarra? Listen. You're not to do
                     anything except come back here.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Sir, department policy requires
                     that all allegations of homicide
                     have to be investigated. And these
                     are kids, for chrissakes --
          
                               JONES
                     Departmental policy is what I say
                     it is, you got that? Now I'm
                     ordering you to get your ass back
                     here with that kid, you got that?
                     You bring him here and you talk to
                     no one, got it? Nobody!
          
          He slams the phone down.   CUT BACK TO --
          
          -- Ybarra in juvenile hall, agonizing over this. Finally,
          his voice resigned, he looks into the interrogation room.
          
                               YBARRA
                     All right, let's go.
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Jones has come out into the hall, where Briegleb, several
          supporters and a handful of reporters are standing at the
          receiving officer's desk. They approach quickly.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Are you Captain Jones?
          
                                JONES
                     I am.
                               BRIEGLEB
                     What the hell have you done with
                     Christine Collins? Don't try and
                     lie your way out of it. I talked
                     to several neighbors who saw her
                     being driven off in a police car.
          
                                JONES
                     Mrs. Collins has been placed in
                     protective custody following a mental
                     breakdown.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     A what?!
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                      75.
          
          
                               JONES
                     Her statements and behavior have
                     been found to be consistent with a
                     delusional state of mind that could
                     make her a danger to herself or
                     others. In the public interest, we
                     are looking after her son while she
                     gets the help she clearly needs.
          
                                 BRIEGLEB
                     Where?
          
                               JONES
                     Sorry, we're withholding that
                     information to respect the privacy
                     of the family. But I can assure
                     you that she's getting the best
                     treatment available. That's all.
          
          He heads back the way he came as the others shout questions
          after him, held back by other police officers.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DAY ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Patients are being corralled into a line that extends to a
          barred window where a nurse is dispensing pills.
          
                               VOICE ON PA

          Christine is nudged forward by an orderly, Carol beside her.

          She's nudged to the window, where a nurse hands out a pill
          and water.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't want to relax...I'm fine,

          Christine sees Dr. Steele, breaks away and rushes to him.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Doctor...Doctor Steele --
          
                                  STEELE
                     I heard.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't know what's going on, but
                     I'm not taking anything until --
          
                               STEELE
                     I understand. Come with me.
          
          He moves off into an adjoining room. Carol Dexter, next in
          line, takes her pill...but keeps an eye on Christine.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          He goes to his desk as she stands in the doorway.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't have anything wrong with me
                     that I should have to take
                     medication.
          
                               STEELE
                     There's nothing wrong with you.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     That's right.
          
                               STEELE
                     You're fine.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Yes.
          
          He pulls a typed letter out of his desk, slides it across.
          
                               STEELE
                     Then you shouldn't have any trouble
                     signing this.
          
          She picks it up, reads as he continues:

          She tears up the sheet of paper.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I was not wrong! That boy is not
                     my son! And I am not going to stop
                     telling the truth about this! And

                               CHRISTINE
                     -- I will tear down the walls of

                     have to, but one way or another --
                                STEELE
                     Orderly!
          
          An orderly appears in the doorway.
          
                               STEELE
                     The patient is disturbed, hyperactive
                     and is threatening the staff. See
                     to it she is properly sedated.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     No!
          
          She BURSTS past the orderly, running into

          running, pursued by orderlies, two more blocking her way.

                     please, help me!
          
          They TACKLE her and bring her down. She struggles as the
          others look on, and you can see in their eyes that they don't
          like what they're seeing, there's rage --
          
          -- and a furious Carol Dexter comes to her aid. She JUMPS
          into the struggle. Biting. Kicking. Scratching.
          
          Steele comes on the run just as the orderlies peel Carol off
          the fight, spinning her around to face Steele, who SLAPS her.
          
                               STEELE
                     Stay out of this! This is none of
                     your business!
                         (to the rest)
                     This is police business! You'll
                     stay out of it if you know what's
                     good for you!
          
          He looks to Carol, Christine restrained behind them.
          
                               STEELE
                     You'd think you had enough trouble
                     with the law just being a whore,
                     wouldn't you?
          
          He smiles. She gets a hand free and SLUGS him, hard, a nail
          slicing his cheek. He touches his face. It comes back with
          blood. Then he looks to the orderly.

                     eighteen. Electro-convulsive
                     therapy.
          
          The orderly hauls Carol off, kicking and screaming, as
          Christine is moved toward the nurse's station.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Carol!   No, leave her alone!    What're
                     you --
          
          They force a pill in her mouth, following with water as they
          hold her nose, forcing her to swallow. She chokes, swallows.
          They march her down the hall as Steele returns to his office.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Carol....!

          INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          The electro-shock room. Carol struggles against the orderlies
          who force her down onto the gurney. A nurse behind her applies
          conductor jelly to her temples as another orderly shoves a
          rubber bite-guard into her mouth.
          
          Then a pair of metal pincers, points covered in cloth, are
          pressed against her temples. A button is pushed...and her
          body goes RIGID as a jolt of electricity blasts through her
          body. (This was, remember, fairly common practice for violent
          behavior in the 1920s.)
          
          Then she passes out, her eyes rolling up in her head.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Christine is peering out the narrow slot in her door as she
          sees Carol being wheeled down the hall and put into her bed.
          Christine, sobbing, collapses slowly to the floor, caught in
          a nightmare and unable to wake up.

          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          Detective Ybarra is sitting at his desk, not happy about a
          lot of his life at this moment. He's turning over the photos
          of the missing kids identified by Sanford Clark and arranging
          them on his desk the way you might arrange cards, playing
          solitaire. He looks up --
          
          -- to see Sanford being led out of one of the holding areas,
          hands cuffed, clothes in his hands. Being transferred to a
          waiting bus. The two exchange a look. Ybarra looks away.
          Sanford continues toward the bus.
          
          Finally, in agony, Ybarra can't take it any more. He rises,
          goes to the officer standing by the door to the bus.
          
                               YBARRA
                     It's all right, I'll take it from
                     here.
          
                               OFFICER
                     But --
          
                               YBARRA
                     We need him for questioning.   Come
                     on....
          
          He leads Sanford away, then stops two passing officers.

                               YBARRA
                     You two...you've just been
                     requisitioned for backup. I'll
                     explain on the way.
          
          He hurries off.   The officers follow, not sure what's up.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING
          
          Christine sits beside Carol's bed. She's awake but dazed.
          Christine dabs a wet cloth against her forehead.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     You shouldn't have done that.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                         (with difficulty)
                     Wanted...to. Felt...good.
          
          Carol takes her hand, holds it.
          
                                CAROL DEXTER
                     I lost...two babies...to back alley
                     doctors...no choice....
                         (beat)
                     Never had...the chance...to fight
                     for them. You do. Don't stop.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I won't...I won't.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     Fuck them...and the horse...they
                     rode in on.
          
          Christine manages a thin smile, despite her tears.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     That's hardly appropriate language
                     for a lady, now is it?
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     Hell, yeah...there are times...that's
                     exactly the right thing to say.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     And when's that?
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     When you've got...nothing left to
                     lose.
          
          Christine touches her face, and we know she's heard this.

          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - EVENING
          
          Two squad cars pull up to the ranch. Ybarra and the other
          officers get out, guns up, not knowing if Gordon is still
          there or not.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: SEPTEMBER 12, 1928
          
          They move quickly through the area, checking the house.
          Everything's dark, silent. One officer runs into the house,
          there's a long pause...then he pokes his head out again.
          
                                  OFFICER
                     All clear.
          
          Ybarra goes back to the car, opens the door.   Sanford emerges.
          
                                  YBARRA
                     All right.     Show me.
          
          Sanford hesitates, then starts toward a nearby barn.
          
          INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
          
          He slides the door open and walks to the far end. The dirt
          here is a strange white-yellow color. Ybarra follows, still
          keeping a wary eye out for trouble. He looks down at where
          Sanford has stopped. Several bags marked LYE are nearby.
          
                                YBARRA
                     This it?   You're sure?
          
          Sanford nods.   Ybarra edges toward a shovel, hands it to him.
          
                                  YBARRA
                     Dig.
                         (off sanford's look)
                     You put 'em in the ground, you can
                     take 'em out of the ground. Go on.
          
          Sanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of
          dirt and lye, dust rising around them. Ybarra watches,
          pensively, as the other officers edge their way in. He's
          looking the other way when one of the officers reacts:
          
                               OFFICER
                     Holy god....
          
          Ybarra glances back...to see a child's shoe being unearthed.
          And beside it...bones. And then...a skull.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Call it in...get the coroner and
                     every officer in a twenty mile radius
                     here inside the hour.

                               YBARRA (Cont'd)
                     Then put out an APB on Gordon Stewart
                     Northcott, the info is in my car.
                     Go on....
          
          The officer races out of the barn as Ybarra looks to Sanford,
          who is still digging, crying as he goes.
          
                               YBARRA
                     You can stop now, son.
                         (he doesn't)
                     You can stop now. It's over. We
                     can take it from here. It's over.
          
          Sobbing, Sanford drops the shovel and collapses on the ground,
          hands covering his face, crying in great, heaving sobs.
          
                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          The patients are lined up outside their rooms for inspection.
          Steele passes down them in review. Stops in front of
          Christine, who looks exhausted, worn, pale, her eyes
          bloodshot...but still defiant. He glances to the orderlies.
          
                               STEELE
                     Privacy, please.
          
          The orderlies move all of the other patients away, except for
          Christine, who shares a glance with Carol. Several other
          orderlies remain. He glances at her chart in his hands.
          
                               STEELE
                     I see you've still been refusing
                     medication, requiring force-feeding.
                     I see they switched to a rubber
                     tube. I hear that can quite
                     uncomfortable.
          
          She doesn't answer. Her eyes never leave his.     He pulls
          another copy of the letter out of the folder.
          
                                STEELE
                     Six days, Mrs. Collins, and no

                     Unless you're willing to prove you're
                     doing better...by signing this.
          
          He holds it up in front of her. She focuses first on it,
          then on him...and finally, her spine where it needs to be
          even if the rest of her is in shambles, looks at him and says:

                     Fuck you....and the horse...you
                     rode in on.
          
          He nods, shrugs, puts the letter back in the folder.   Turns
          to the orderlies.
          
                               STEELE
                     Room eighteen.
          
          They GRAB her and start muscling her down the hall, Christine
          kicking and screaming as they go. Steele continues out to
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          where he comes through the double-barred door just as Gustav
          Briegleb charges in the front door, carrying a newspaper.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN CHARGE!

                     WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE!
          
          Steele approaches.
          
                               STEELE
                     I'm head doctor on duty.   What's
                     the problem?
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     You the doctor who's got Christine

          Intercut with:
          
          INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          They wheel Christine into the room, struggling, fighting
          against the straps that pin her to the gurney.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS
          
          Steele turns away from Briegleb, unconcerned.
          
                               STEELE
                     Sorry, we don't discuss our cases

                     You'll damned well discuss this one

          Briegleb THRUSTS the newspaper into Steele's hands.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     Read it!   Read it, damn you!
          
          Steele unfolds the paper, looks at the headline, which we
          don't see. His reaction, though, is ominous and serious.
          
          INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          The nurse behind Christine applies the conductor jell to her
          temples. She's fighting the best she can, but it's hopeless.
          The nurse picks up the electro-shock pincers. Places them on
          Christine's temples. Reaches for the button --
          
          -- as suddenly the door opens, and a nurse steps in, stopping
          the process. The nurse goes to the one at the controls,
          whispers in her ear. The nurse then says something quietly
          to the orderly, who starts to undo the straps that hold
          Christine to the gurney.

          They pull her up off the gurney.

          Christine is ushered inside, where Steele is waiting.    He
          looks upset about something.

          She forces herself to stand straight, not easy given what
          she's just been through. He approaches.
          
                               STEELE
                     One last time. Are you, or are you
                     not, prepared to sign that letter?
          
          She looks up into his face, her resolve unshaken, her voice
          dry but firm for:
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     No.
          
          He studies her for one last BEAT, then turns his back.
          
                               STEELE
                     You're free to go.

          Christine takes a moment to process this...not sure if she
          heard this right, or if it's a trick.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     ...what?
          
                               STEELE
                     Your clothes are in the next room.
                     You can change there.
          
          She hesitates a second, looks to the orderly, being careful
          in case this is a set-up.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Next door.
          
                                STEELE
                     That's right.
                         (to the orderly)
                     See to it.
          
          The orderly nods. She takes one last look around, then gets
          the hell out of the room. Alone, Steele picks up the newspaper
          that had been laying face-down on his desk, looks at it, and
          shakes his head.

          Carol is there as Christine, now in her regular clothes, comes
          dashing in. Carol sees her, goes to her.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     You're getting out?

                     Watch me.
          
          They hug. Christine breaks the hug, and hurries away as Carol
          looks on, crying.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Christine comes to the area where she was checked in. No one
          is looking at her. She passes the nurse's station and heads
          toward the door. Opens it. Fresh air comes in. Freedom.
          She steps out the front door as --
          
          -- a moment later, Briegleb passes through the hallway with
          an admissions official, having not seen her.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     You give me every piece of paper
                     you've got on this case, you hear
                     me? Every piece!
          
          The official moves on, nervous, as Briegleb looks to the
          receiving nurse.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     When does she come down?
          
          Before she can answer, we jump out to

          Vindicated. She starts to pass a news-stand, where a NEWS
          VENDOR is calling out headlines, peddling papers.

          The last line stops Christine...just a bad sense that grows
          as she turns to the news vendor, who keeps on going.

          Christine's knees buckle as she hears this. She starts to go
          down as Briegleb runs toward her from the hospital.

          And she collapses into his arms, sobbing uncontrollably, as
          passers-by glance over at her...and continue walking.

          But they're just words.   She doesn't hear them.
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Captain Jones is pacing nervously in the hallway for a long
          BEAT when another officer steps out of an office with a brass
          nameplate that reads CHIEF OF POLICE JAMES E DAVIS.

          lots of dark wood and filtered light. Davis is sitting at
          his desk, looking at a series of newspapers in front of him
          as Jones steps up and stands before the desk.
          
                               DAVIS
                     I don't know if you're aware of it,
                     Captain, but I have an exceptionally
                     good vocabulary. I'm a terror at
                     Scrabble, crossword puzzles, but
                     even I'm in awe of the vocabulary
                     that the press and the city council

                               DAVIS
                     The key, of course, is the context
                     in which words like this get used.
                     You have to do that in scrabble,
                     you know, when somebody challenges
                     a word...show how it's used in a

                     "A department so incompetent that
                     they never realized that up to twenty
                     children were being kidnapped and
                     murdered under their very noses."
                         (looks over)
                     And here: "So incompetent that they
                     insisted they knew better than a
                     mother the identity of her own child,
                     forced him upon her, and then
                     incarcerated her when she confronted
                     them with evidence of their own
                     reprehensible behavior." That was
                     a two-fer. Incompetent and
                     reprehensible in the same sentence.
                     Guy must be a real terror at

          Davis gets up and crosses the room, looking out through the
          slatted windows at the busy Los Angeles street outside.
          
                                DAVIS
                     Captain, your handling of the Collins
                     case has exposed this department to
                     public ridicule. There is even the
                     potential for civil and criminal

                     There were four other photos of

                               DAVIS

                                DAVIS
                     The Mayor wants this to go away. I
                     want this to go away. The way you
                     do that is to stop insisting that
                     Walter Collins was not among those
                     kids killed up at that goddamned
                     ranch. Because if the boy you
                     brought back isn't Walter Collins,
                     and he's not dead up at that ranch,
                     then where the hell is he? People
                     will want to know why we haven't
                     found him. Why we aren't we doing
                     our job.
                         (beat)
                     But if, on the other hand, he is,
                     or could be among those poor boys
                     killed up in Wineville...then the
                     inquiries stop. It's a momentary
                     embarrassment that you'll have to
                     live with...but better a short
                     inconvenience than a lingering
                     problem, wouldn't you say, Captain?
          Jones doesn't like it, but he swallows his pride.   Nods.
          
                                 JONES
                     Yes, sir.
          
                                DAVIS
                     The boy's been gone for nearly a
                     year. If he was going to be found,
                     it would've happened by now. Whether
                     he was up at that ranch or not, the
                     truth is he probably is dead
                     somewhere. Better his mother accepts
                     that now rather than later, don't
                     you think?
          
                                 JONES
                     Yes, sir.

                                 DAVIS
                     Good.    That'll be all, Captain.
          
          Jones starts to leave, then looks back as Davis settles back
          behind his desk.
          
                               JONES
                     Sir, there's talk of an investigation
                     by the police commission.
          
                               DAVIS
                     Let me worry about the commission.
                     But it wouldn't hurt to find out
                     just who the fuck that kid is you
                     brought back from De Kalb and why
                     he did this, because the press bought
                     into his bullshit same as we did.
                     That we were all taken in by the
                     scheming little bastard may help
                     take some of the sting off this.
          
                               JONES
                     My boys are working on it now, sir.
          
          And he exits as we go to
          
          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
          
          Detective Ybarra is sitting on one side of a table, a notepad
          in front of him, staring across at "Walter," who isn't very
          happy right now, and is staring back with substantial venom.
          His true, nasty personality is free to come out at last.
          There's a long BEAT, then:
          
                               "WALTER"
                     I want a glass of water.
          
                                 YBARRA
                     Tough.
          
                               "WALTER"
                         (mocking)
                     "Tough!"
          
                               YBARRA
                     What's your name?
          
                               "WALTER"
                     Walter Collins.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Walter Collins is dead.
          
                               "WALTER"
                         (shrugs)
                     I didn't do it.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                   91.
          
          
                               YBARRA
                     Look, let me explain something to
                     you. Because of your lies, you've
                     ruined a woman's life embarrassed
                     the police department, and got the
                     whole city up in arms over this.
          
          "Walter" considers this for a BEAT, then smiles.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     Got a lot done, didn't I?
          
          Ybarra exchanges a look with the matron, then closes up his
          notepad.
          
                               YBARRA
                     All right, if that's how you want
                     it, then I guess we're done here.
                         (to matron)
                     Tell County Jail we're remanding
                     him for trial.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     Wait...what's remanding?    What trial?
          
                               YBARRA
                     I told you, the real Walter Collins
                     was murdered.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     So? I didn't do anything! I wasn't
                     even here when it happened!
          
                                YBARRA
                     By pretending to be Walter Collins,
                     you're interfering in a police
                     investigation of a kidnapping and
                     murder. We can try you as an
                     accomplice to murder after the fact.
                         (beat)
                     Too bad. County Jail is a lot worse
                     than juvenile hall or a foster home.
                     A lot worse.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     You can't do that...I'm just a kid!
          
                               YBARRA
                     Sanford Clark is a kid, too.
                     Fifteen. But he's going to jail.
                     All murderers and their accomplices
                     go to jail. Everyone knows that.
                         (to the matron)
                     Get him out of here. It's out of
                     my hands now.

          He heads for the door when "Walter" cries out, scared.
          
                                "WALTER"
                     Wait!   I don't want to go to jail.
          
                                 YBARRA
                     Prove it.
          
          And on the boy's face, we HEAR:
          
                               YBARRA (V.O.)
                     Arthur Hutchins.
          
          INT. JONES' OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Ybarra is standing in the doorway to Jones' office, speaking
          to the Captain and looking at his notepad.
          
                               YBARRA
                     The boy's real name is Arthur
                     Hutchins Junior, age twelve, a
                     runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
          
                               JONES
                     Did you check the wire services?
          
          Ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Checks out. The report was filed
                     by his divorced mother, who lives
                     in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's
                     grandmother. Apparently he didn't
                     like living with the old lady, she
                     didn't let him get away with the
                     stuff he usually got away with, and
                     one day...he up and left.
                               JONES
                     What about the man he showed up
                     with at the diner?
          
                               YBARRA
                     Just some drifter. The boy was
                     hungry, ran into this guy who said
                     he knew how to get some food and
                     not have to pay for it. Only when
                     they finished, he left the kid behind
                     while he cut out. When the police
                     picked him up, they started going
                     through the wire reports about
                     missing kids --
          
                               JONES
                     And he overheard them say the name
                     Walter Collins.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                    93.
          
          
                                 YBARRA
                     Bingo.
          
                               JONES
                     But why that one? I mean, of all
                     the police departments he could've
                     screwed up, why Los Angeles?
          
                               YBARRA
                     I asked him the same question.
          
          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - FLASHBACK
          
          Moments earlier.    PUSHING IN on "Walter" for:
          
                                "WALTER"
                     I...I knew that Los Angeles was
                     where they made the Tom Mix movies.
                     I figured maybe I could meet Tom
                     Mix. Maybe he'd even let me ride
                     his horse.
                         (beat)
                     His horse is named Blue. Did you

                     know that?
          
                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - RECTORY - DAY
          
          Christine is in a bed in a small room in the rectory, a tray
          beside her, still recovering from her experience. Briegleb
          enters and approaches a nearby chair.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     How are you feeling?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     A little better, thanks. The sleep
                     helped. Anything new outside?
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Nothing that can't wait until you're
                     stronger. The police still have a
                     car parked outside. They want to
                     know what your next move is.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I want to go home.
          
                                 BRIEGLEB
                     And then?
          
          She takes a BEAT, then slowly, gingerly gets out of bed.

                                CHRISTINE
                     I've been giving that a great deal
                     of thought ever since I got out of
                     that...place. All those women, and
                     what they did about Walter....
                         (beat)
                     They're going to just keep on doing
                     it, aren't they? Nothing's going
                     to change...unless we make it change.
          
          She glances out the window, to the police car parked across
          the street.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I used to tell Walter, "Never start
                     a fight...but always finish it." I
                     didn't start this fight...but by
                     god I'm going to finish it.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     It's dangerous, and you've already
                     been through a great deal, Mrs.
                     Collins. Right now you're
                     sufficiently high-profile that the
                     police will hesitate to come after
                     you out in the open...but if they
                     see their position threatened, that
                     could change quickly.
                         (beat)
                     Your life could be in danger.
          
          She takes a beat, then turns to him from the window.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     "Always finish it. Always."
          
          EXT. ROW HOUSE - VANCOUVER - EVENING
          A series of red-brick rowhouses line a quiet street. We see
          couples walking, hand in hand, kids playing...then we notice
          Gordon Northcott coming around the corner. He looks around,
          then cuts across a yard, jumping over a fence to get to

          She opens the door and finds Gordon Northcott standing outside.
          
                                GORDON
                     Hi, sis.

                               GORDON
                     Got in a couple of days ago, figured
                     I'd surprise you. That okay?
          
                               RACHEL CLARK
                     Yes...yes, of course. Come on in.
          
          She steps aside as he enters, looks around.
          
                               GORDON

                     Staying --
          
                               GORDON
                     Listen, can I use your bathroom?
                     It's been a long ride and I could
                     use a shower.
          
                                  RACHEL CLARK
                     Of course.
          
          He passes her and heads upstairs. She steps to the back of
          the house, where her husband, BOB, is coming in through the
          back, wiping engine grease off his hands with a towel.
                                BOB
                     Is that --
                         (she nods, scared)
                     Go next door. I'll call the police.
                     Hurry.
          
          She rushes past him into the other room to do just that.
          
          INT. ROWHOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Gordon is toweling off his hair when he hears a car door slam
          shut. Then another. He peers out the window. Several Royal
          Canadian Mounted Police cars have pulled up along the street.
          Mounties are getting out, moving quietly toward the house.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                     96.
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bob quietly lets the Mounties in. They signal for Bob to get
          the hell out of there. Guns in hand, they climb the stairs.
          
          Suddenly there's the SOUND of breaking glass from above.
          They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon
          fleeing across an adjoining rooftop.
          
                               MOUNTIE
                     Go around the other side!    Cut him
                     off!
          
          The others take off as he and another Mountie climb through
          the broken window in pursuit of Northcott.
          
          EXT. ROWHOUSES - NIGHT
          
          Gordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the
          next one as, below, Mounties race to keep up with him, WHISTLES
          blowing furiously. He looks behind him to see the other two
          Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast.
          
          Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance
          between himself and the police on the ground...and making
          increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop
          to rooftop.
          
          He leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running.
          The rooftop Mounties follow. One of them makes the jump
          successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the
          ground three stories below. A leg snaps on impact. The first
          Mountie hesitates, looks down. The second one waves him on.
          
                                SECOND MOUNTIE
                     Go on!   Get the bastard!
          
          He nods and continues the chase.
          Gordon runs for all he's worth.    The Mountie keeps after him.
          
          Gordon makes another leap. The Mountie jumps...but he's short.
          He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs
          back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to
          shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free --
          
          -- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back
          off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then
          grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming.
          
          Gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be
          jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction --
          
          -- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard. The two go down in a
          tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                   97.
          
          
          They SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going
          over the edge.
          
          With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the
          punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the
          Mountie backs off just a bit --
          
                               MOUNTIE
                     Screw this...I'm too old for this
                     fightin' shit....
          
          -- and DIVES at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the
          two-story roof and DOWN into --
          
          -- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers
          and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned
          by Gordon.
          
          As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers
          to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise
          intact Gordon. Looks at him nose-to-nose.
          
                               MOUNTIE
                     YOU...ARE UNDER...ARREST!
          
          And he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers.
          
          INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Christine opens the door to find Reverend Briegleb and another
          man on her porch, S. S. HAHN, late fifties.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Mrs. Collins, I want you to meet a
                     friend of mine, Mr. Hahn.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Hello.

                     Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences
                     on your loss.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Can we come in?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes...of course.
          
          She steps aside to let them in, closing the door under:
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Mr. Hahn, was it?
          
                               HAHN
                     Yes.

                               CHRISTINE
                     I appreciate the sentiment, but so
                     far they still haven't positively
                     identified any of the...remains...
                     as Walter's.
          
                               HAHN
                     But he was identified, was he not?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes, but...I guess I still can't
                     accept it. It doesn't feel real to
                     me.
          
                               HAHN
                     It never does. I lost a daughter
                     to polio five years ago. There's
                     not a day goes by I don't think, I
                     should mention this to Claudine...
                     then I remember she's not here.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     I'm sorry.     Please, sit.
          
          They do as Christine looks to Briegleb.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     I've been on the phone all day with
                     the appointment secretary for the
                     police commission. They won't let
                     me testify at the hearing, or call
                     witnesses. They say it's not
                     necessary.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     I know. My sources tell me the
                     police commission is going to come
                     out with a report that whitewashes
                     the whole thing. They're going to
                     say that Jones and the rest of the
                     LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,
                     that the real blame is with the
                     kid...and with you, for being
                     difficult and forcing them to put
                     you away for your own safety.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Then we'll just have to hire a
                     lawyer...bring a civil suit and try
                     to get the City Council to call for
                     a hearing by the Welfare Board.

                     Not one lawyer outside this room
                     was willing to take on the Police
                     Department. Too risky, they said.
                     So finally I went to the very best
                     attorney in town, a man who's sued
                     the city four times and won.
                     Unfortunately, we could never afford
                     to hire him.

                     It would be my honor to defend your
                     honor, Mrs. Collins. In my fifteen
                     years as a lawyer, I have never
                     seen anyone fight as long or as
                     hard as you have, in what is so
                     clearly in the cause of justice.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn
                     here the whole story, from end to
                     end, leave nothing out, he'll need
                     it all if he's going to get the
                     City Council involved.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Of course. One thing, though. A
                     personal favor. When we've finished
                     here today, could you spare a few
                     minutes to come with me downtown.

                     Well, I didn't, did I? Didn't know
                     anyone wanted me until just recently.
                     Didn't even try. My luggage still
                     has my initials on it.
          
                                ANOTHER REPORTER
                     Did you know why the police were
                     after you?
          
                               GORDON
                     No, but I figured it would be best
                     if I stayed out of it.
          
                               REPORTER
                     Anything to say to the parents of

                               GORDON
                     No comment.
          
          And on that the police hustle Gordon away.
          
          INT. CHIEF DAVIS' OFFICE - DAY
          
          Davis is filling out paperwork as the door opens. He looks
          up as LOS ANGELES MAYOR GEORGE CRYER enters, closing the door
          after him again.
                               DAVIS
                     Mayor Cryer...this is unexpected.
          
                               CRYER
                     So was this.
          
          He drops a series of court documents on Davis' desk.   He picks
          them up, examines them.
          
                               CRYER
                     Subpoenas, requests for depositions,
                     interrogatories...all courtesy of
                     Mr. Hahn and his new client,
                     Christine Collins.

                                CRYER (Cont'd)
                     You don't have to look them over
                     too closely, Chief, your own copies
                     should be arriving any time now.
                         (beat)
                     The City Council has also agreed to
                     look into this, starting immediately.
          
                               DAVIS
                     Goddamnit....
          
                               CRYER
                     I thought this was supposed to go
                     away. This is an election year, I
                     can't afford this kind of press.
          
                               DAVIS
                     It is going away, sir.   I instructed
                     Captain Jones --
          
                                CRYER
                     I'm afraid falling on his sword and
                     saying he made a mistake isn't going
                     to be good enough, Chief. If we
                     take him out of the picture for a
                     while, it might help calm things
                     down until the hearing's finished.
                         (beat)
                     There are several people on the
                     council who are planning to run
                     against me, and they'd love to accuse
                     me of allowing a renegade police
                     force to operate with impunity.
          
          Cryer shakes his head, walks off a pace.
          
                                CRYER
                     Our friends in the press are having
                     a field day with this mess. I'm
                     getting five hundred phone calls,
                     letters and telegrams a day demanding
                     to know what the hell is going on
                     at City Hall that we allow our police
                     force to brutalize women and misplace
                     children. Christ, all this picture
                     needs now is for somebody to kick a
                     puppy for the cameras.
                         (beat)
                     This is a train, Chief, and we need
                     to either get in front of it, or be
                     run over by it.
          
                               DAVIS
                     Mayor Cryer...I stand by my men.

                     So the question is..are we going to

          EXT. CITY HALL - DAY
          
          Mayor Cryer stands beside Chief Davis and addresses a rather
          noisy and worked-up press corps from behind a podium.
          
                               MAYOR CRYER
                     Gentlemen...gentlemen, please. As
                     Mayor of Los Angeles, it is my duty
                     to preserve the peace in our city,
                     which has been disrupted by recent
                     events in the case of Christine
                     Collins. As a result, we have
                     decided that Captain J. J. Jones of
                     the Lincoln Heights Division is to
                     be suspended from active duty,
                     effective immediately.

                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     The charge is conduct unbecoming an
                     officer, and using improper and
                     abusive language toward Mrs. Collins.
                     It further charges that he exceeded
                     his authority as a police officer
                     by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on
                     the alleged charge of insanity
                     without sufficient cause.

                     Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the
                     City Council has said it plans to
                     open its own investigation into the
                     Collins case?
          
                               MAYOR CRYER
                     I've heard this, yes. But since
                     one of the main purposes of such a
                     hearing by the City Council would
                     be to suspend Captain Jones, and
                     since that action has now been taken,
                     the question is moot.

                     Which makes it look like the only

                     go uncomfortably high up the food

                               CHIEF DAVIS

                     with a response. Good day.

                     Cheer up, Chief. That little show
                     should take the wind out of their
                     sails. By Monday, this issue will
                     be as cold as yesterday's fish.
                     Never underestimate the public's
                     lack of attention and potential for

          She opens the door as Briegleb enters with three really large,
          dangerous looking men, one of whom is carrying a heavy trench
          coat.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Reverend, what --
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs.
                     Collins, but it took me a while to
                     find the right people for the right
                     job. These three gentlemen are
                     members of my congregation who,
                     before coming to the Lord, had lived
                     lives of brutality, vice and crime.
                     Now they are pledged to doing god's
                     work...and if this isn't it, I don't
                     know what is.
          
                               CHRISTINE

                               BRIEGLEB (Cont'd)
                     disappearing right before the trial.
                     I'm a big believer in the power of
                     prayer, Mrs. Collins...but a little
                     backup from time to time never hurts.
          
          The others nod as they make themselves comfortable in the
          living room.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I see...well, I...thank you.   Can I
                     get you anything?
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Since we don't plan on sleeping,
                     coffee would be lovely.
          
          She heads off to get some coffee. As one of the men puts his
          coat behind the sofa, we see that it contains a sawed-off
          shotgun. Briegleb looks out the window, to where a police
          car sits, watching the house.
          
                                                    DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          She's dressed in her best dress, putting on a hat and a pair
          of gloves. Her hands are shaking. She squeezes them together,
          closes her eyes. Focuses. With one final, deep breath, she
          heads out.
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING
          
          The same police car is there as Christine gets into a car
          with Briegleb and the two drive off. The other three men get
          into another car and follow. The police car in turn pulls
          away from the curb, following both cars.
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - BRIEGLEB'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          He's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear
          view mirror to keep an eye on things. Looks over to Christine,
          smiles encouragingly. Looks ahead.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     Traffic's getting heavy.   We'll go
                     up Spring.
          
          He turns. The other cars do the same. But the traffic here
          is even worse. Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear
          view mirror to see --
          
          -- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting
          off the car with Christine's bodyguards.

          Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's
          too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police
          car glide into position two cars behind them.
          
          Traffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the
          very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is
          lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then
          there's a momentary break in traffic.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     Hold on.
          
          He turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts
          off the engine. Jumps out and opens the door for Christine,
          who gets out.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Start walking. Quickly.
          
          They do. He glances back at the police car. The two inside
          start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being
          right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the
          other. They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too
          late as --
          
          -- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot,
          Briegleb glancing behind them. The foot- and car-traffic is
          very heavy...we HEAR horns honking and, in the distance,
          something that could be the sound of lots of people.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Almost there. Just a few more
                     blocks.
          
                               CHRISTINE

                     from...?
          Briegleb glances back. The police car has popped its doors,
          and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine
          stops a man passing in the opposite direction.
          
                               CHRISTINE

                     Didn't you hear? It's the biggest
                     protest I've ever seen.
          
                                REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Protest?
          
                               OFFICER
                     Yeah...over that Collins broad, if
                     you can believe that.

          He moves on. Briegleb and Collins slowly exchange a look
          somewhere between disbelief and "oh shit."

                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     I don't know...all I know is that I
                     think I just stopped breathing....
          
          They walk quickly up one clogged street and down another, the
          police following on foot...moving toward the SOUND of voices,
          drums, and cars honking... until they turn onto Spring Street --
          
          -- and find themselves in the middle of the biggest protest
          march ever recorded in the history of Los Angeles to this
          date. Thousands of people crowd into the street, overwhelming
          the police presence...not rioting, but making their voices
          heard.
          
          The Salvation Army, the Women's Temperance Society, the Society
          for Justice, Catholic groups, Union groups and ordinary
          citizens carrying placards and signs that read WE SUPPORT
          CHRISTINE COLLINS and JUSTICE FOR MRS. COLLINS and THE LAPD:
          A CITY'S SHAME...it just goes on and on and on. Christine
          looks out to see her boss from the telephone company, Mr.
          Harris, marching arm in arm with the rest. He sees her,
          smiles, tips his hat and continues marching.
          
          Christine is stunned...Briegleb even moreso.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Oh...my....

                     Mrs. Collins.
          He looks behind them, to where the police have stopped.
          There's no way in hell they can make a move in the face of
          something as big as t his. Briegleb smiles.

                     Boy howdy, does He ever.   Come on.
          
          They continue up the street toward City Hall.

          This is a big room, and one thousand observers fill every
          available chair with more standing along the wall in back.
          It's a circus. Christine sits with Hahn.

          Briegleb is in a seat behind the main section.    FLASHBULBS

          SUPERIMPOSE: OCTOBER 24, 1928
          
                               THORPE
                     There are nearly one thousand people
                     gathered in this chamber, more than
                     have ever been in this room before.
          
          EXT. CITY HALL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Speakers are lowered from the window into the parking lot
          where hundreds of others are gathered to listen.
          
                               THORPE
                         (on pa)
                     I therefore ask you to refrain from
                     demonstrations of any kind. We're
                     all here because we want to find
                     out the real facts in this case,
                     and everybody is going to be heard
                     if we have to sit here for a week.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          As Thorpe looks to the other members of the Council, and the
          area where witnesses are supposed to wait to be called upon.
          A number of seats are empty.
          
                               SECOND COUNCILMAN
                     Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any other
                     members of the Police Commission.
          
                               THORPE
                     That's odd...we specifically
                     stipulated that we would begin our
                     hearings with testimony from the
                     police department. Are there any
                     representatives of the Police
                     Commission in the room?
                         (no answer)
                     Is Chief Davis here?

                               REPORTER (Cont'd)
                     Only reason I know is we have a
                     couple of our boys out covering the
                     thing.
          
                                THORPE
                     Are you telling me they directly
                     violated the wishes of the City
                     Council? That they refused to attend
                     a vital hearing so they could conduct
                     a routine inspection in San Pedro?
                     And what the hell is Jones doing at
                     an inspection after being suspended?
                         (beat)
                     I hate to call a recess before we've
                     even started, but I think a few
                     phone calls are in order. So we'll
                     take a half hour break, then continue
                     with the witnesses who have appeared
                     here today. But let it be known
                     that Captain Jones and Police Chief
                     Davis will be subpoenaed and required
                     to appear here tomorrow morning.
          
          There's APPLAUSE from the crowd which breaks up into pockets
          of discussion as a BAILIFF approaches Hahn and whispers into
          his ear. Hahn nods, looks to Christine.
          
                               HAHN
                     Mrs. Collins, could you come across
                     the street with me for just a moment?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     But...shouldn't we --
          
                               HAHN
                     I think there's something you should
                     see.
          Puzzled, curious, Christine gets up and exits with Hahn.
          
          INT. LA COUNTY COURTHOUSE -   HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Hahn is moving quickly down the hall toward a courtroom door,
          Christine following.
          
                               HAHN
                     -- the police decided it was best
                     to keep this off the main docket in
                     order to avoid exactly the sort of
                     chaos we have across the street.
          
          He gets to the door, pauses. Looks back to her.    She nods.
          He opens the door and they enter

          INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Dead silence, in marked contrast to the city council room.
          As she enters, she sees people sitting silently in the
          gallery...row after row of couples, mothers and fathers, some
          weeping softly. Some of them notice Christine's entrance and
          nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common
          bond...they are all carrying the same grief.
          
          One of the couples, MR. AND MRS. CLAY, see Christine and go
          to her, speaking softly. They should be distinct enough in
          appearance that we will recognize them instantly when we see
          them again later.
          
                                MRS. CLAY
                     Mrs. Collins? I'm Leanne Clay,
                     this is my husband, John...I just
                     wanted to pass on my sympathies.
                     What we went through, waiting to
                     hear anything about our son David,
                     was bad enough, and now this....
                         (beat)
                     But there was no call for what the
                     police did to you...no call at all.
          
          She nods her thanks as a door at the other end of the courtroom
          opens. They take their seats as a judge and two attorneys
          take their places, preceded by a bailiff.
          
                                 BAILIFF
                     All rise.
          
          They do. The judge takes his seat. The rest of the room
          also sits. He nods to the bailiff, who in turn opens another
          door, leading to the holding area.
          
          As Christine looks on, Gordon Stewart Northcott is ushered
          into the courtroom for his initial plea. Some women break
          into tears at the sight of him. He first seems startled by
          the presence of so many, then he smiles. An audience.
          
          As he takes his place beside his attorney, he looks down the
          room and meets the gaze of Christine Collins. Her face pales,
          as though slapped...but she doesn't look away.
          
                               GORDON
                     Hey...I saw you in the papers. You
                     got a lot of moxie, standing up to
                     the police like that.
          
          The bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge.
          Christine's hands grip the seat she's in until her knuckles
          turn white...but she doesn't allow him the satisfaction of
          seeing her react to his comments. The judge looks up.

                               JUDGE
                     Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have
                     been charged with three counts of
                     murder in the first degree, with an
                     additional seventeen counts under
                     review by the district attorney's
                     office. How do you plea?
          
                               GORDON
                     Not guilty, your honor.
          
          He glances back at his audience.   The bailiff rights him again.
          
                                JUDGE
                     In light of the defendant's penchant
                     for international travel, no bail
                     will be set. This court will receive
                     preliminary motions by tomorrow
                     morning, with a trial date to be
                     set for the earliest opening on the
                     court's calendar.
                         (beat)
                     The defendant is remanded into
                     custody. Bailiff....
          
          The bailiff removes Gordon, who shares one last look with his
          audience, and Christine in particular. He winks at her. She
          doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction.
          But once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes,
          fighting tears. Hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says
          nothing. There's nothing to say.
          
                               JONES (V.O.)
                     The boy, Walter Collins, was reported
                     as missing on March 10, 1928.
          
          INT. CITY COUNCIL ROOM - DAY
          Jones is at last on the stand. Hahn stands before him, the
          rest of the City Council, Christine and the huge audience
          looking on.
          
                               JONES
                     We then instituted a nationwide
                     search. On July 10, we received a
                     cable indicating that a boy matching
                     his description had been found in
                     De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning,
                     he admitted to being Walter Collins,
                     and we made arrangements to transport
                     him back to California.

                               JONES
                     Yes. She denied his identity in
                     spite of all evidence pointing to
                     the contrary.
          
                               HAHN
                     But as subsequent events have
                     demonstrated, she was correct. So
                     what prompted you to send her for
                     psychological evaluation?
          
                               JONES
                     Whether or not this was in fact the
                     correct boy was not relevant to my
                     decision. Throughout this period,
                     she acted strangely. She was often
                     cool, aloof and unemotional,
                     especially when presented with the
                     boy we located in De Kalb, and in
                     our subsequent conversations. It
                     was because of her disturbing
                     behavior that I submitted her for
                     observation to the psychopathic
                     ward of Los Angeles County General
                     Hospital.

                     That's correct. There was no need
                     to serve the warrant since she was
                     at that time already in custody.

          More murmuring from the crowd.
          
                               JONES
                     Extraordinary steps were necessary

                     extraordinary situation! Is it our

                     by the boy who claimed to be Walter
                     Collins? No. In light of his claims
                     and her behavior, who wouldn't begin
                     to wonder if there was something
                     wrong with her?

                     Because she wouldn't listen, because
                     she insisted on being obstinate and
                     taking matters into her own hands

                     you had done anything wrong!
          
          This silences both Jones and the crowd. You could hear a pin
          drop. Hahn approaches Jones, and now speaks softly.
          
                               HAHN
                     And in the end, that's what happened,
                     isn't it? At some point, while all
                     this was going on, Walter Collins
                     died along with as many as nineteen
                     other youths on the Northcott Ranch
                     in Wineville. Is that correct,

          Jones looks to Chief Davis.   It's a moment.    Then:
          
                                JONES
                     Yes.   It is.

          EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
          
          A small crowd is assembled at the front of the station, where
          Chief Davis stands with the Boy who had been "Walter" as a
          train pulls up before them.
          
                                CHIEF DAVIS

                     recent trouble, as Arthur Hutchins
                     of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Between
                     this, and the arrest of the man
                     suspected of murdering the real
                     Walter Collins, we have cleared up
                     two of the biggest mysteries in the
                     history of Los Angeles.
                         (beat)
                     I hope that you gentlemen of the

                     the good things we do as the mistakes
                     that are made on rare occasions.
          
          Just then, he turns as a Matron comes off the train with JANET
          HUTCHINS, middle thirties, the boy's mother.
          
                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     Ladies and gentlemen, let me
                     introduce you to the boy's real
                     mother, Mrs. Janet Hutchins.
          
          She goes to him and hugs him. "Walter" looks like he wishes
          he were somewhere on Mars. Davis moves closer to them to be
          in frame while the FLASHBULBS pop. She's in the same pose as
          they got Christine to take when she "accepted" her lost son.

                     Oh, no, not at all....
          
          He towsels the boy's head like he'd like to cut it off. Then
          he nods to an aide, who approaches with a bundle of clothes.

          She yanks him away.   Davis smiles gamely at the reporters.

                     In that place where we will all be
                     reunited with our loved ones someday.
                     And on that day, he will know, front
                     to back, end to end, heart and
                     soul... that you did everything you
                     could, Christine. Everything.
          
          She nods absently, finishes adjusting the sheets.   He checks
          his watch.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     We should go.
          
          She nods again, and stands. He heads out of the room, and
          she lingers for a moment, taking one last look around before
          turning off the night-light, and sees the drawing he made of
          the two of them walking together beneath an orange sun. HOLD
          on that image as we HEAR a gavel hammering and:

          PUSHING IN on Thorpe, at the center of the council's long
          table, addressing the crowd and Christine.
          
                                THORPE
                     This Committee has now heard all of
                     the testimony, and in light of the
                     facts presented, issues the following
                     statement.
          
          INTERCUT WITH
          
          INT. COURTROOM - DAY
          Where Northcott stands before the judge, jury, and the grieving
          family members.
          
                               JUDGE
                     Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a
                     verdict?
          
                               FOREMAN
                     We have, your honor.
          
          INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
          
          Still pushing in.
          
                               THORPE
                     While the City Council has no power
                     to directly remove commissioners or

                                  THORPE (Cont'd)
                       the employees who serve under them,
                       it nevertheless can perform the
                       function of making recommendations.
                       This committee therefore reports
                       and recommends:
                           (beat)
                       First, that the majority members of
                       the Police Commission deserve the
                       severest condemnation for their
                       decision to whitewash the Collins
                       case.
          
          APPLAUSE erupts from the gallery at this.
          
          INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Quietly PUSHING IN on Northcott, the Judge, Jury, others.
          
                                 JUDGE
                       Bailiff, will you bring me the
                       verdict of the jury?
          
          The bailiff complies. The judge reads it, hands it back to
          the Bailiff, who brings it back to the Foreman.
          
          INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
          
          As before.
          
                                  THORPE
                       Second, we recommend that the
                       suspension of Captain Jones be made
                       permanent.
          
          Even louder applause, some cheering. The pattern continues
          through the balance of the statement.
          INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Favoring Northcott.
          
                                 JUDGE
                       Will the defendant please rise?
          
          Northcott rises, still smiling, defiant.
          
          INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
          
          As before.
          
                                 THORPE
                       Third, that steps be taken to
                       investigate a change in the
                       prevailing laws and procedures by

                     which a citizen of this city can be
                     subjected to incarceration in the
                     county's mental facilities.
                         (beat)
                     Finally, restoration of public
                     confidence in the police department
                     can only be achieved by the removal
                     of its chief of police, and this
                     committee so recommends.
                         (beat)
                     This hearing is concluded.
          
          The place explodes with cheers.
          
          INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          As the foreman stands again.
          
                               JUDGE
                     You may read the verdict.
          
                               FOREMAN
                     We the jury find the defendant,
                     Gordon Stewart Northcott...guilty
                     on all counts of murder in the first
                     degree.
          
          There are gasps and cries and tears...but Northcott is defiant.
          
                               JUDGE
                     Does the defendant wish to make a
                     statement before judgment is passed?
          
                               GORDON
                     Yeah, I want to make a statement.
                     I want to make it real clear that I
                     never once got a fair shake from
                     you, your "honor," or this court.
                     The only one of you here worth a
                     goddamn is her --
                         (points to christine)
                     -- 'cause she's the only one never
                     badmouthed me to the press. She
                     understands what it is when the
                     police frame you for something you
                     didn't do and throw you in the hole.
                     Isn't that right?
          
          He looks to her.   She doesn't flinch.
          
                               GORDON
                     I want you to know, Mrs. Collins, I
                     never killed your boy. I --

                               JUDGE
                     That's enough! Counsel, you will
                     get control of your client or I
                     will have him bound and gagged.
          
          The defense attorney yanks Gordon around to face the judge.
          
                               JUDGE
                     Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the
                     judgment of this court that you
                     will be conveyed to San Quentin
                     Prison, where you will be held in
                     solitary confinement for a period
                     of two years, until October 2nd,
                     1930. On that date, you are to be
                     hanged by the neck until dead. May
                     god have mercy on your soul.
          
          And he brings down the gavel.
          
          EXT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Christine is standing outside, putting the horrors of the day
          out of her thoughts, as a door opens and Chief Davis comes
          out, followed by several reporters.
          
                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     -- no, as I said after the hearing,
                     I have every intention of finishing
                     my term as Chief of the Los Angeles
                     Police Department. I will not
                     resign. I will fight to the finish.
                     The Collins case was merely an excuse
                     for certain politicians who have
                     been trying to have me removed for
                     some time, and I --
          
          He pauses as he sees Christine.    Looks away and continues in
          a lowered voice.
          
                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     -- anyway, I remain confident that
                     the Mayor's office will stand firmly
                     behind me. That's all.
          
          The press continue after him, not really noticing Christine,
          who takes one last look around at it all...and walks slowly
          away. Alone.

          INT. STREET CAR - MORNING
          
          Christine, alone, rides the street car to work. The car stops
          in front of a school. Walter's school. She looks out the
          window, to where children are playing. Then looks away again
          as the street-car starts moving again.

          Christine is back at work again, as she had been, though some
          of the light has gone out of her eyes. She moves from station
          to station, nodding her approval or checking off forms. She
          glances to the clock, it's a little after two, then goes to
          Mr. Harris, who has just come out onto the floor.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Ten minute break?
          
                                  MR. HARRIS
                     Of course.
          
          She starts away, turning at:
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     You know...one of these days you
                     might consider actually taking one
                     of these ten minute breaks. Might
                     be good for you.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     We'll see.     Thanks, Ben.
          
          She heads off toward a back room. He watches her go with a
          combination of awe, respect and deep sadness.
          
          INT. PHONE COMPANY - BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Christine is on the telephone, crossing off contact numbers
          on a pad of paper.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Yes, hello, this is Christine
                     Collins, we spoke yesterday about
                     my son...fine, thank you. I was
                     wondering if you'd had a chance to
                     go through the file on runaways in
                     your area in case anyone resembling
                     Walter had --
                         (beat)
                     I see. No, thank you, I appreciate
                     the information. Would it be all
                     right if I called you again, in a
                     month or so? Thank you. Goodbye.

          He's heard part of the conversation, and there's a sadness in
          his eyes.
          
          She starts to dial again when he knocks on the door.     She
          turns to see him, mid-dial.

                     I know. That's...why I wanted to
                     see you.
          
          His tone is grave, and she knows that something's happened.
          She hangs up the phone, missing the cradle the first time.
          
                               HAHN
                     It's about Walter. We had...well,
                     we received a very strange telegram.

                     to see you.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                     Why?
          
                                HAHN
                     He said he knows you're still looking
                     for your son, and before he dies --
                         (beat)
                     He says that he lied when he
                     testified that he didn't kill Walter.
                     He's willing to finally admit that
                     he did it. He says that if you
                     come up to see him, in person...he'll
                     tell you the truth, to your face...so

          She gets out of a taxi in front of the prison.    It's a gray,
          grim sight, and moves toward it.
          
                                HAHN (V.O.)
                     Took me most of the morning to make
                     all the arrangements. Turns out
                     you're the first woman in thirty
                     years the state has allowed to visit
                     a serial killer on the night of his
                     execution.
          
          INT. SAN QUENTIN - INTERVIEW ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Four bare walls and a long table. Two chairs. One window,
          behind bars and chicken wire. Christine waits, alone. Then:
          we HEAR footsteps approaching down the hall. A moment later,
          a PRISON GUARD escorts Northcott into the room. Northcott
          nods to Christine, then glances to the guard, who looks to
          Christine.
          
                               PRISON GUARD
                     I can stay in the room if you want,
                     ma'am.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, I'm...sure I'll be fine.
          
                               PRISON GUARD
                     All right...I'll be right outside
                     the door if you need anything.

          The guard exits, leaving the two alone.

                     No, I don't smoke.
          
          He nods, walks to the window to a nearby structure.

                               GORDON
                     The hangings. Ten o'clock tonight,
                     I get to see what's inside. I hear
                     there's thirteen steps going up to
                     the gallows...'cause thirteen is
                     unlucky. Helps make sure you're
                     gonna go to hell when you die. But
                     I got 'em beat. I outsmarted 'em.
          
          He looks to Christine, smiles nervously, glances back out the
          window.
          
                               GORDON
                     They're gonna let me have whatever
                     I want for dinner. Got a steak
                     coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes
                     and green beans. I always wondered
                     why they did that whole last meal
                     thing. One of the other guys on
                     Death Row said when you take the
                     drop, you foul yourself, and
                     everything you ate...comes out the
                     other end. So maybe that's why
                     they make sure you got something in
                     you when it happens. They like
                     knowing you fouled yourself on the
                     way to --
          
          He stops himself.   Turns from the window.
          
                               GORDON
                     Sure you don't got a cigarette?
          
          She shakes her head.   He nods absently for a moment.
                               GORDON
                     The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a
                     good guy. He's writing a book about
                     all the death sentences he's carried
                     out in this place. Says it's called
                     "Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women."
                     Beats my record all to hell.

                     Mr. Northcott...you asked me to
                     come to see you. You said if I

          He's pacing, growing more agitated and scared.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                     Now what?

                     you...not today, not tonight, not
                     with what they're going to do to

                                 CHRISTINE
                     Why not?
          
                               GORDON
                     Because I don't want to die with a
                     lie on my lips!
          
          He turns from her, in anguish...but is he just playing her?

          
                               GORDON
                     I did my penance, I asked God to
                     forgive me for my sins...and I've
                     been good, ever since...if I commit
                     a sin now, if I lie now...I'm out

          She goes around to him, faces him.

                     Look at me.
          
          He turns almost against his will...meets her eyes.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Did you...kill...my son?
          
          His eyes go wide and he CRIES OUT, stumbling back and away
          from her.

          The guard enters, going to Northcott.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, wait, please --

                     It's okay, ma'am, they always get a
                     little nuts the day of.
          
          She pushes past him to Northcott, grabs the front of his shirt.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Did you kill him? Did you kill my
                     son?
          
          He screams in anguish, and the guard hauls him out, closing
          the door after him. Christine tries to open the door, but it
          won't open.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Mr. Northcott...Mr. Northcott!
          
          She slowly slides to the floor, crying as we HEAR the SOUND
          of CHAINS clanking, and we....

          The door to the prison yard opens and closes as Northcott is
          led into the area with the scaffolding. The Warden is there,
          waiting at the foot of the gallows, along with a chaplain.
          
          Several other parents, including Mr. and Mrs. Clay, are in
          the witness gallery at the back, separated from the gallows
          area by a large plate glass window. Christine is among the
          parents. The Clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for
          strength. Christine nods, accepting it, and moves to one
          side.
          
          Northcott, legs and arms bound in chains, makes his way to
          the warden at the base of the gallows. A clock reads 9:50.

                               WARDEN
                     Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have
                     been found guilty of murder, the
                     penalty for which is death by
                     hanging. There have been no stays
                     or reprieves, therefore the execution
                     will go forward as stipulated under
                     the laws of the State of California.
                     Do you have any last words?
          
                               GORDON
                     No...nothing.
                         (to chaplain)
                     I kept clean after I confessed,
                     reverend...just like I said I would.
          
          The chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards,
          who begin to escort Northcott up the steps to the gallows.
          
                               GORDON
                     Will it...will it hurt?
                         (no reply)
                     Please...not so fast...don't make
                     me walk so fast!
          
          They struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the
          last of the thirteen steps to the top. They tie his legs
          together, and cinch his arms tightly in place.
          
                               GORDON
                     Thirteen steps...thirteen steps...
                     but I didn't touch all of 'em, you
                     bastards...I didn't touch all of
                     'em!
          
          They start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure
          the rope. He looks desperately to the witnesses.
                               GORDON
                     A prayer! Please, somebody, say a
                     prayer for me!
          
          The mask goes on and is tightened into place. The executioner
          approaches the handle that will open the trap door. The warden
          looks to the clock...9:59. From beneath the hood we HEAR, in
          a terrified, shaking voice:
          
                               GORDON
                     Silent night...holy night...all is
                     calm...all is bright...round yon
                     virgin mother and child...holy infant
                     so tender and mild --
          
          Just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the
          lever and the trap door JERKS OPEN.

          Northcott FALLS through the door six feet then there's a
          SNAP...and the body bounces in SLOW MOTION at the end of the
          rope...as we HEAR the sound of his heart
          slowing...slowing...until it finally stops.
          
          Christine covers her eyes. There is no cheering in the witness
          room. Only the sound of weeping.

          Slowly, the witnesses exit the prison. We find Christine
          among them. She nods good-night to some of them, including
          the Clays, then starts off on her own, heading into the night.

                     Hey, Chris...we're having an Oscar
                     party tonight at my apartment, you
                     want to come?

                     Sandy, you guys blew out the phone
                     lines between here and Baltimore,
                     someone has to clean up the mess,
                     and that's me. Besides, I've got a

          They head off. Christine focuses on her work.     There's another
          knock on the door.

          She looks up to see Ben Harris in the doorway.    He smiles.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     I'm meeting some friends for dinner
                     at Musso and Frank's on Hollywood.
                     They're going to pipe the Oscar
                     ceremony through to the restaurant.
                     Should be quite a night. I'd love
                     it if you'd come.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Ben, that's very sweet, and I wish
                     I could...but I really need to stay
                     and finish this.
          
          He nods, taking the rejection well.   Starts off when:
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Ben...? I put down two dollars on
                     "It Happened One Night" for best
                     picture. Seems I'm the only one
                     here who thinks it has a chance
                     against "Cleopatra." If I win, how
                     about we have dinner tomorrow night
                     to celebrate?
                               MR. HARRIS

          trying to get out, but it slams shut in their faces.
          
          They scream, trying to get out.   Gordon SLAMS an arm against
          the door, scaring them.

                     Yeah...two of them were brothers, I
                     think their last name was Winslow,
                     something like that. The oldest
                     was Jeffrey, I think he was around

                     Because of what happened.
          
          INT. CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT
          
          Two of the kids, Walter and Jeffrey, are sitting in a corner,
          talking quietly, urgently.
          
                               DAVID (V.O.)
                     Walter and Jeffrey were talking
                     when everybody else was screaming.
                     They were scared, same as the rest
                     of us, but they weren't scared
                     stupid. They kept checking around
                     until they found a part of the coop
                     where the chicken wire was all messed
                     up.
          
          They pull at the wiring.    Part of the roof weakens and dust
          sifts down.
          
                               DAVID (V.O.)
                     They figured we might be able to
                     yank the chicken wire and bring
                     down the corner, maybe make enough
                     room to get out of there and run...
                     but it would make an awful lot of
                     noise and if it wasn't wide enough,
                     we'd be stuck. It might even bring
                     the whole place down.

          And in an echo of what he told his mother the last time he
          saw her:
          
                                WALTER
                     I'm not. I'm not afraid of
                     anything.

          look to the rest.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     Anybody else?
          
          David holds up his hand.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     Okay. Anybody who doesn't want to
                     come, get over at that end in case
                     this comes down.
          
          The Winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end,
          too terrified to try and escape. Jeffrey, David and Walter
          go to the weakened corner of the coop.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     When we get out, we split up, go in
                     different directions, they can't
                     catch all of us. Ready?
          They nod, and get into position, each taking a part of the
          wire framework.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     Pull!
          
          They do so, pulling for all they're worth...struggling...the
          ceiling SHIFTS above them, dirt falling all over the place...
          they pull harder, the wire cutting into fingers, but still
          pulling...then suddenly --
          
          -- the corner FALLS AWAY, part of the roof starting to come
          down with it. The NOISE is substantial.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     Go!

          They race out the opening, Jeffrey first, then Walter, then
          David...but just as the first two get clear --
          
                               DAVID
                     Help!
          
          Walter turns to see David stuck in the wiring. LIGHTS go on
          around the ranch. He hesitates...then RUNS back to David,
          helps to untangle him. They HEAR a SHOTGUN blast, and FEET
          running their way.
          
                               DAVID
                     Hurry!
          
          Walter gets him untangled, and the two RACE away from the
          coop, running for all they're worth as a FLASHLIGHT hits first
          one, then the other. They RUN --
          
          -- and David catches one last glimpse of Walter running,
          heading for the line of trees....
          
                               YBARRA (V.O.)
                     And that's the last you saw of him?
          
          INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          As the interview continues.   David nods.
          
                               DAVID
                     That's the last I saw of any of
                     'em.
          
                               YBARRA
                     So you don't know if either of the
                     other two were captured?
          
                               DAVID
                     No. All I know is, if he hadn't
                     come back for me...I don't think I
                     ever would've gotten out of there.
          
                               YBARRA
                     What happened after that?
          
                               DAVID
                     I hid in the woods for two days,
                     too scared to move, because I was
                     sure they'd find me. I finally
                     started walking, but every time a
                     car came up I was afraid it was
                     them. So I kept off the main roads
                     until I saw a train stopped at a
                     crossing, and I jumped in.

                               YBARRA
                     Why didn't you tell anyone what had
                     happened?
          
                                 DAVID
                     I was afraid! I thought they'd
                     come after me, or my folks...so I
                     didn't tell anybody. I was on my
                     own until I got a free meal from
                     this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told
                     her I was an orphan, on my own.
                     She said I could stay on, and...I
                     did.
                          (beat)
                     Every night, I'd wake up, thinking
                     they were right outside my window.
                     Then I heard the police talking on
                     the radio about what happened at
                     the ranch, and I thought, for sure
                     I can't go back now.
          
                                YBARRA
                     Why not?
          
                               DAVID
                     Since I didn't tell anybody what
                     happened, I was afraid they'd blame
                     me for those kids being dead. So I
                     just...stayed away.
          
                               YBARRA
                     So what made you come forward now,
                     after all this time?
          
          David looks away, his eyes tearing up.   Finally:
          
                               DAVID
                     I miss my mom...I miss my dad...I
                     just...I just want to go home.
          
          And it's all Mrs. Clay can take. Sobbing, she runs out of
          the viewing room and into the interview room, where she goes
          to her son and embraces him, holds him, the two crying into
          one another's arms.
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
          
          Christine and Ybarra watch as Mr. and Mrs. Clay lead their
          son into their car. As they drive off, Christine finally
          breaks the silence.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Still can't believe it. Five years,

                     dead...and there he is.

                     And he wouldn't be, if it wasn't

                     Your son did a brave thing, Mrs.
                     Collins. You should be very proud
                     of him.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I am.
          
                               YBARRA
                     You don't think he's still out there,
                     do you?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Why not? Three boys made a run for
                     it that night, Detective. If one
                     got out, maybe either or both of
                     the others did too. Maybe Walter
                     went through the same fears he did.
                     Afraid to come home or identify
                     himself, afraid he'd get into
                     trouble, that people might think it
                     was his fault. Either way, it gives
                     me something I didn't have before
                     tonight.
          
                               YBARRA
                     What's that?
          
          She looks at him...and smiles.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Hope.
          
          She turns and walks off into the night, as we SUPERIMPOSE:
          
          
          Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935
          
          In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford
          Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for
          Boys for five years. Upon being released in 1934, he returned
          home to Canada, and was never heard from again.
          
          Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J.
          Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by
          Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and
          fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never
          paid.
          
          One year after the City Council recommended the removal of
          the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from
          office and was replaced by Roy E. Steckel.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                  139.
          
          
          Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red
          Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices,
          but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police
          corruption.
          

          In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal
          justice system in California was revised to prevent women
          from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of
          disagreeing with a male police officer. Strict medical
          procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse.
          
          In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer was voted
          out of office after three terms. He was later found to have
          been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate,
          which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern
          California.
          
          For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb used
          his radio show to expose police misconduct and political
          corruption. He also published "The Layman's Handbook of
          Daniel."
          
          The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became
          synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch. In order
          to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name
          to Mira Loma.
          
          
          
          Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son.
          
          
          
          The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery. If he was able
          to escape the Northcott Ranch, he would be 86 years old today.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK

               Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the 
               oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- 
               a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy 
               clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.

               CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a 
               fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting 
               from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and 
               louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.

               CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a 
               man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is 
               upon us, flashing by with a roar.

               Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the 
               embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the 
               thick underbrush alongside the tracks.

               CLOSE SHOT -- BODY

               It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS 
               AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the 
               train fades off until there is silence once more.

               TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY

               A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side 
               overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- 
               tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.

               One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.

               She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite 
               activity -- eating.

               Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS 
               CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, 
               black and ugly in the sunlight.

               REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.

               The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun 
               shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight 
               into REGGIE's face.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks

                         Don't tell me you didn't know it was 
                         loaded.

               SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early 
               thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join 
               REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS.

                                     REGGIE
                         Isn't there something constructive 
                         he can do -- like start an avalanche?

                         Va jouer, mon ange.

               JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so 
               lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of 
               cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.

                                     SYLVIE
                         When you start to eat like this 
                         something is the matter.

               No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as 
               REGGIE continues eating.

                                     REGGIE
                         Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Ça alors! From Charles?

                                     REGGIE
                         He's the only husband I've got. I 
                         tried to make it work, I really have -- 
                         but --

                                     SYLVIE
                         But what?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know how to explain it. I'm 
                         just too miserable.

               REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards 
               the devastated table before following.

                                     SYLVIE
                         It is infuriating that your 
                         unhappiness does not turn to fat!

               INT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY

               A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow-
               covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows 
               beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their 
               conversation continuing.

                                     SYLVIE
                         But why do you want a divorce?

                                     REGGIE
                         Because I don't love him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         But that is no reason to get a 
                         divorce!

               EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY

               An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-
               worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, 
               their conversation continuing.

                                     SYLVIE
                         With a rich husband and this year's 
                         clothes you will not find it difficult 
                         to make some new friends.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sitting)
                         I admit I moved to Paris because I 
                         was tired of American Provincial,

                                      
                         but that doesn't mean I'm ready for 
                         French Traditional. I loathe the 
                         idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if 
                         only Charles had been honest with me -- 
                         that's all I ask of anybody -- the 
                         simple truth. But with him, everything 
                         is secrecy and lies. He's hiding 
                         something -- something frightening -- 
                         something terrible -- and evil.

               She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over 
               her. She wheels, terrified.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK

               A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the 
               face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this 
               particular mask stare down at REGGIE.

                                     MAN
                         Does this belong to you?

               CAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly 
               by the man in the mask.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too 
               terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA, 
               takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face.

                                     PETER
                         Oh, forgive me.
                              (indicating JEAN-LOUIS)
                         Is this yours?

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating SYLVIE)
                         It's hers. Where'd you find him, 
                         robbing a bank?

                                     PETER
                         He was throwing snowballs at Baron 
                         Rothschild.
                              (a pause)
                         We don't know each other, do we?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why, do you think we're going to?

                                     PETER
                         I don't know -- how would I know?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm afraid I already know a great 
                         many people. Until one of them dies 
                         I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

                                     PETER
                              (smiling)
                         Yes, of course. But you will let me 
                         know if anyone goes on the critical 
                         list
                              (he starts off)

                                     REGGIE
                         Quitter.

                                     PETER
                              (turning)
                         How's that?

                                     REGGIE
                         You give up awfully easy, don't you?

               Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation 
               and rises.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a 
                         walk. I have never seen a Rothschild 
                         before.

               SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy 
               squirts PETER with his pistol.

                                     PETER
                              (drying)
                         Clever fellow -- almost missed me.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm afraid you're blocking my view.

                                     PETER
                              (moving)
                         Sorry. Which view would you like?

                                     REGGIE
                         The one you're blocking. This is the 
                         last chance I have -- I'm flying 
                         back to Paris this afternoon. What's 
                         your name?

                                     PETER
                         Peter Joshua.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm Regina Lampert.

                                     PETER
                         Is there a Mr. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes.

                                     PETER
                         Good for you.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.

                                     PETER
                         Please, not on my account.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, you see, I don't really love 
                         him.

                                     PETER
                         Well, you're honest, anyway.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- 
                         dishonesty infuriates me. Like when 
                         you go into a drugstore.

                                     PETER
                         I'm not sure I --

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, you go in and you ask for some 
                         toothpaste -- the small size -- and 
                         the man brings you the large size. 
                         You tell him you wanted the small 
                         size but he says the large size is 
                         the small size. I always thought the 
                         large size was the largest size, but 
                         he says that the family size, the 
                         economy size and the giant size are 
                         all larger than the large size -- 
                         that the large size is the smallest 
                         size there is.

                                     PETER
                         Oh. I guess.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

                                     PETER
                         Yes, but we're divorced.

                                     REGGIE
                         That wasn't a proposal -- I was just 
                         curious.

                                     PETER
                         Is your husband with you?

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. 
                         First it was separate rooms -- now 
                         we're trying it with cities. What do 
                         people call you -- Pete?

                                     PETER
                         Mr. Joshua.
                              (turning to go)
                         Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Now you're angry.

                                     PETER
                         No, I'm not -- I've got some packing 
                         to do. I'm also going back to Paris 
                         today.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who 
                         said: "When strangers do meet they 
                         should erelong see one another again"?

                                     PETER
                         Shakespeare never said that.

                                     REGGIE
                         How do you know?

                                     PETER
                         It's terrible -- you just made it 
                         up.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are 
                         you going to call me?

                                     PETER
                         Are you in the book?

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles is.

                                     PETER
                         Is there only one Charles Lampert?

                         When you get your divorce will you 
                         be going back to America?

                         He knows everything.

                              (to JEAN-LOUIS)
                         Don't you want me to stay?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Yes, of course -- but if you went 
                         back and wrote me a letter --

                                     REGGIE
                         -- you could have the stamps. I'll 
                         get you some here, okay?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Okay.

               REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver, who carries 
               her cases.  She presses the button that electrically opens 
               the front door.

               DELETED

               INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY

               As the elevator rises REGGIE gets out, followed by the driver.  
               He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door.

                                     REGGIE
                              (handing him a tip)
                         Merci.

               The driver leaves. She goes to the door and presses the 
               minuterie, the button that turns on the time-light, and the 
               lights come on. Then she rings the doorbell. There is no 
               answer. She rings again. Still nothing. Sighing, she digs 
               out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. At this 
               moment the minuterie expires, plunging the scene into 
               darkness.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE
                         Wonderful.

               She finds the button and the light goes on again. She inserts 
               the key and turns it.

               INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- ENTRANCE HALL -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- DOOR as it opens and REGGIE steps into the 
               CLOSE SHOT.

               She stops, her expression changing.

               REVERSE SHOT

               From REGGIE's p.o.v. as CAMERA PANS the entrance hall. It is 
               bare -- no furniture, no rug, no pictures, no nothing.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               She stares for a moment, then goes back out into the landing.

               INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY

               As REGGIE steps back outside. She looks at the nameplate 
               beside the door.

               INSERT NAMEPLATE

               It reads "MR. AND MRS. CHARLES LAMPERT."

               INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY

               REGGIE looks at the plate in disbelief, then turns and hurries 
               back into the apartment.

               INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DAY

               As REGGIE hurries into the entrance hall.

                                     REGGIE
                         Honorine -- !

               No answer.

               Now, CAMERA FOLLOWING, she goes into the Salon. It is also 
               empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's 
               original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still 
               in the wall.

               She rushes now, going into the bedroom, CAMERA FOLLOWING 
               crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom, 
               too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and 
               throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain.

               She pulls open the drawers -- nothing!

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles -- !

               She turns, and running now, goes through another door to the 
               library, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The rows of shelves are as empty 
               as the rest of the apartment. She begins to turn in a circle, 
               looking for something, anything. In a panic she turns and 
               runs out, colliding suddenly with a MAN whom she (and we) 
               have not noticed until the moment of impact.

               REGGIE screams.

               CLOSE SHOT -- INSPECTOR GRANDPIERRE

               A heavy-set man of no particular age with tobacco-colored 
               hair, and thick glasses.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Madame Charles Lampert?

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE, in a state of near-shock.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre 
                         of the Police Judiciaire. Would you 
                         be so kind as to come with me, please?

               INT. MORGUE -- DAY

               We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too- 
               familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin.

               ANOTHER ANGLE -- OVERHEAD

               Looking straight down at the tops of REGGIE's, GRANDPIERRE's 
               and an ATTENDANT's head and smack into the open drawer.

               GRANDPIERRE lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and 
               reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.

               He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then 
               moves to the other end to uncover the head.  As the sheet 
               starts to lift:

               REVERSE SHOT

               REGGIE as she looks down into the CAMERA. She closes her 
               eyes for a moment, then looks again.

                                     GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Well, Madame -- ?

               She nods.

                                     GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         You are positive?

               She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         You loved him?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm very cold.

               GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT.

               CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the 
               wall. BLACKNESS comes with a loud clang and continues while 
               the echo dies.

               INT. GRANDPIERRE'S OFFICE -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- DESK DRAWER (FROM ABOVE) as it is pulled open.

               A photograph of Charles Lampert lies face up in the drawer.

               A hand reaches in and pulls it out.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE, 
               sitting across from him. The office is as bare as most 
               policemen's offices. GRANDPIERRE studies the photo.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         We discovered your husband's body 
                         lying next to the tracks of the Paris-
                         Bourdeaux railroad line. He was 
                         dressed only in his pajamas. Do you 
                         know of any reason why he might have 
                         wished to leave France?

                                     REGGIE
                         Leave?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Your husband possessed a ticket of 
                         passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed 
                         from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this 
                         morning at seven.

                                     REGGIE
                              (a pause)
                         I'm very confused.

               She starts to rummage through her bag. GRANDPIERRE shoves a 
               package of French cigarettes across the desk to her. But she 
               pulls a package of nuts out of her bag. She begins separating 
               the shells with her thumb nail and eating the nuts, depositing 
               the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an 
               instant.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         He was American?

                                     REGGIE
                         Swiss.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Oh. Swiss. His profession?

                                     REGGIE
                         He didn't have one.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         He was a wealthy man?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know. I suppose so.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         About how wealthy would you say?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Where did he keep his money?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Besides yourself, who is his nearest 
                         relation?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                              (exploding)
                         C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment 
                         absurde!

                                     REGGIE
                         I know.
                              (pause)
                         I'm sorry.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         It is all right.

               GRANDPIERRE sighs, puts down his pencil and pushes a button 
               on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it 
               into his mouth.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Is it all right?

                                     REGGIE
                         I wish you wouldn't.

               He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into 
               the drawer, closing it fiercely. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN sticks 
               his head in the door.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Les effets de Lampert.

               The POLICEMAN leaves and closes the door.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         On Wednesday last your husband sold 
                         the entire contents of the apartment 
                         at public auction. Furniture, 
                         clothing, kitchenware -- everything. 
                         The gallery, in complying with his 
                         wishes, paid him in cash. One million 
                         two hundred and fifty thousand New 
                         Francs. In dollars, a quarter of a 
                         million. The authorities in Bordeaux 
                         have searched his compartment on the 
                         train. They have searched it 
                         thoroughly. They did not find 
                         $250,000, Madame.

               He opens the desk drawer, puts the cigar back in his mouth 
               and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk-
               top before he remembers REGGIE's request. He puts it back in 
               the drawer again. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters 
               again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits 
               on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into 
               the basket.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         These few things are all that was 
                         found in the train compartment. There 
                         was no other baggage. Your husband 
                         must have been in a great hurry.

               He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, 
               identifying each item as he does.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         One wallet containing four thousand 
                         francs -- one agenda --
                              (pausing, he opens 
                              the notebook)
                         -- his last notation was made 
                         yesterday -- Thursday --
                              (reading)
                         "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs-
                         Elysées"
                              (looking up)
                         Why there?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                              (dryly)
                         Obviously.
                              (returning to the 
                              items in the basket)
                         One ticket of passage to South America -- 
                         one letter, stamped but unsealed, 
                         addressed to you --

                                     REGGIE
                              (lighting up)
                         A letter? May I see it?

               GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as 
               she reads it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (reading)
                         "My dear Regina: I hope you are 
                         enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be 
                         so lovely this time of year. The 
                         days pass very slowly and I hope to 
                         see you soon. As always, Charles. 
                         P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. 
                         Your appointment has been changed."
                              (she looks up, puzzled)
                         Not very much, is it?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         We took the liberty of calling your 
                         dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we 
                         would learn something.

                                     REGGIE
                         Did you?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Yes. Your appointment has been 
                         changed.
                              (he smiles at his 
                              little joke, then 
                              returns to the basket)
                         One key to your apartment -- one 
                         comb -- one fountain pen --  one 
                         toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder
                              (he looks up)
                         -- that is all.

               He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts 
               to put the things back into the basket while he speaks:

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         If you will sign this list you may 
                         take the things with you.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sighing)
                         Is that all? Can I go now?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         One more question. Is this your 
                         husband's passport?

               He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport 
               which he hands to her.

               INSERT -- PASSPORT

               The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it 
               to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in GRANDPIERRE's 
               photo. Under it is the name: "CHARLES LAMPERT."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     REGGIE
                         Of course it is.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And this?

               He hands her another passport.

               INSERT -- SECOND PASSPORT

               The cover is American. When it is opened, we see the identical 
               picture, but the name under it reads: "CHARLES VOSS."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't understand.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And this? And this?

               He hands her, one at a time, two more passports.

               INSERT -- THIRD AND FOURTH PASSPORTS

               One is Italian which, when opened, shows the same photo with 
               the name "CARLO FABRI." The other is Venezuelan, the same 
               photo, and the name "CARLOS MORENO."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Have you nothing to say, Madame?

               REGGIE looks down at the four passports, then back to 
               GRANDPIERRE.

                                     REGGIE
                              (hopefully)
                         It's all right if you want to smoke 
                         your cigar now.

               INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DUSK

               The house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late 
               afternoon light coming from outside. REGGIE stands by a 
               window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby.

               Suddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING.

               CLOSER SHOT -- REGGIE

               As her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. There is a 
               moment of silence, then FOOTSTEPS are heard, coming closer.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As PETER enters.

                                     REGGIE
                              (surprised)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     PETER
                         I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted 
                         to tell you how sorry I am -- and to 
                         find out if there was anything I 
                         could do.

                                     REGGIE
                         How did you find out?

                                     PETER
                         It's in all the afternoon papers. 
                         I'm very sorry.

                                     REGGIE
                         Thank you.

               A silence.

                                     PETER
                         I rang the bell but I don't think 
                         it's working.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.

               He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and 
               flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more 
               times.

                                     REGGIE
                         They must have turned off the 
                         electricity.

               She shakes her head. PETER looks around.

                                     PETER
                         Where did everything go?

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles sold it all -- at auction.

                                     PETER
                         Do you know what you're going to do?

                                     REGGIE
                         Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, 
                         I suppose.

                                     PETER
                         Doing what?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm a simultaneous translator -- 
                         like Sylvie, only she's English to 
                         French -- I'm French to English. 
                         That's what I did before I married 
                         Charles. The police probably think I 
                         killed him.

                                     PETER
                         Instant divorce you mean?

                                     REGGIE
                         Something like that. But I'm sorry 
                         it ended like this -- tossed off a 
                         train like a sack of third-class 
                         mail.

                                     PETER
                              (Taking her hand)
                         Come on. You can't stay here.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know where to go.

                                     PETER
                         We'll find you a hotel.

                                     REGGIE
                         Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady 
                         of leisure anymore.

                                     PETER
                         Something modest but clean -- and 
                         near enough to UNESCO so you can 
                         take a cab when it rains -- okay?

               She nods. He picks up the airlines bag and they start out.

               REGGIE stops at the door and looks back.

                                     REGGIE
                         I loved this room -- but Charles 
                         never saw it -- only what was in it. 
                         All those exquisite things --
                              (looking around)
                         I think I prefer it like this.

               INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT of a phonograph. A hand appears, starts the record 
               on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning.

               An instant later ORGAN MUSIC starts with a roar.

               INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a 
               bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open.

               Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie 
               the remnants of Charles Lampert.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               The INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his 
               hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing 
               row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, 
               dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row, 
               REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they 
               are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at 
               the empty room. They speak in whispers.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's not exactly what I'd call a 
                         large turn-out.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Didn't Charles have any friends?

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.
                              (indicating GRANDPIERRE)
                         If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't 
                         even have him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         At least he knows how to behave at 
                         funerals.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands -- 
               he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper.

               TWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE

                                     SYLVIE
                         Have you no idea who could have done 
                         it?

                                     REGGIE
                         Until two days ago all I really knew 
                         about Charles was his name -- now it 
                         turns out I didn't even know that.

               The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of 
               daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the 
               bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes 
               the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in 
               his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard 
               bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               As he watches GIDEON.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she watches him.

               MED. SHOT -- THE BIER

               GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at 
               LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid 
               succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle 
               from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.

               He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to 
               sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to 
               sit somewhere else.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

                                     SYLVIE
                         Do you know him?

                                     REGGIE
                         I've never seen him before.

                                     SYLVIE
                         He must have known Charles pretty 
                         well.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can you tell?

                                     SYLVIE
                         He's allergic to him.

               SYLVIE turns and glances at GIDEON. Again, the sound of the 
               DOOR opening interrupts them. They turn to look.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against 
               the outside brightness. When he closes the door we can see 
               "TEX" PENTHOLLOW, a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair, 
               a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his 
               forties. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a 
               bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs 
               from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.

               He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING 
               him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at 
               the others present.

               TRAVELING SHOT -- TEX'S P.O.V.

               MOVING down the aisle. GRANDPIERRE's face, then GIDEON's, 
               then REGGIE's and SYLVIE's -- all staring at CAMERA.

               MED. SHOT -- THE BIER

               As TEX arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying 
               on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the 
               coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his 
               lapel and throws it into the open box.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

                                     TEX
                              (heavy Texas accent)
                         Ariva durchy, Charlie.

               WIDER ANGLE

               As TEX turns away from the coffin and approaches REGGIE and 
               SYLVIE, addressing the latter -- after having first reached 
               for his hat which he discovers he isn't wearing.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, ma'am...

               SYLVIE points to REGGIE. Unruffled, TEX starts over. 
               addressing REGGIE this time.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, ma'am...

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes?

                                     TEX
                         Charlie had no call to handling it 
                         this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't understa--

               But TEX has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat.

               When he spots GIDEON, the two men stare at each other.

               Finally, TEX chooses a seat away from him and sits.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               It flies open, this time with a bang, and the large MAN who 
               appears almost fills the frame.

               CLOSER SHOT -- TEX

               As the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid-snore.

               MED. SHOT -- THE DOOR

               Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight -- 
               tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight 
               back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which 
               meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the 
               first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his 
               hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle. 
               Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops 
               before the coffin and stares into it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to 
               dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard 
               at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand 
               from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel, 
               picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down, 
               into the coffin.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND

               The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly 
               but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's 
               hands. There is no reaction.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE

               He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then 
               finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks 
               back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after 
               him.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               Having watched SCOBIE exit. Suddenly a hand falls on her 
               shoulder. She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of 
               fright.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring a funeral ATTENDANT, a cadaverous type (aren't 
               they all) with a black cut-away coat and an over-solicitous, 
               unctuous manner. He is eternally bent at the waist, in a 
               sort of half bow. He offers REGGIE a letter which she takes.

                                     REGGIE
                         Merci, Monsieur.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Pas du tout, madame, pardon -- pardon -- 
                         pardon.

               He backs off and is gone. REGGIE looks at the letter, back 
               and front, then starts to open it.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Who is it from?

                                     REGGIE
                         The American Embassy.

               She pulls out the letter and starts to read it.

               INSERT -- THE LETTER

               It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message 
               reads:

               "Dear Mrs. Lampert: Please drop by my office tomorrow at 
               noon-thirty. I am anxious to discuss the matter of your late 
               husband's death. Sincerely, (signed) H. Bartholomew."

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

               SYLVIE has been reading over REGGIE's shoulder.

                                     SYLVIE
                         What is it about?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.  But if this is a sample 
                         of American diplomacy I'm buying a 
                         fallout shelter.

               EXT. THE AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

               The fine old building in the Rue Gabriel.

               DELETED

               INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY

               As REGGIE leaves the elevator two young DIPLOMATIC TYPES 
               step in, immersed in conversation.

                                     1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         I bluffed the Old Man out of the 
                         last pot -- with a pair of deuces.

                                     2ND DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         What's so depressing about that?

                                     1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         If I can do it, what are the Russians 
                         doing to him?

               The elevator door closes on them. REGGIE reacts to this and 
               starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door.

               MED. SHOT -- DOOR

               It is marked "307-A  H. BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE checks the 
               letter, then opens the door.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY

               The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk 
               is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for 
               somebody, notices that the door to the private office is 
               slightly ajar.

                                     REGGIE
                              (tentatively)
                         Hello -- ?
                              (there is no answer)
                         Hello?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                              (from the private 
                              office)
                         Is there anything wrong, Miss 
                         Tompkins?

                                     REGGIE
                         Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here.

               BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale 
               grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than 
               his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes 
               him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy 
               tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause 
               him to push them back in place every so often with a quick 
               automatic motion.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I'm sorry -- my secretary must have 
                         gone to lunch. You are -- ?

                                     REGGIE
                         Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking at his watch)
                         Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite 
                         late.

               He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do 
               so.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY

               A small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three 
               kids on the desk. BARTHOLOMEW indicates a chair, then goes 
               behind his desk and sits. A can of lighter fluid stands open 
               on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         it's a stubborn little devil.

               He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and 
               hankie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Dry-cleaningwise, things are all 
                         fouled up. I had a good man -- an 
                         excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, 
                         but H.Q. asked us to use the plant 
                         here in the building -- to ease the 
                         gold outflow.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you 
                         know who I am?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking up)
                         Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?
                              (going back to the 
                              tie)
                         Last time I sent out a tie only the 
                         spot came back.

               He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his 
               tie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Voilà! As they say.

               He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the 
               hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket.

               He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches 
               wrapped in waxpaper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of 
               mustard, a bottle of red wine and two Dixie cups.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Have some, please. I've got...
                              (checking)
                         ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken 
                         and -- liverwurst.

                                     REGGIE
                         No thanks.

               He uncorks the wine, fills a cup and begins eating.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. 
                         Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't suppose it's an airline, is 
                         it?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean spies and things like that?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Only we call them agents.

                                     REGGIE
                         We? You mean you're --?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't 
                         think that you people were supposed 
                         to admit --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- 
                         trying to run a bureau of overworked 
                         men with under-allocated funds. 
                         Congress seems to think that all a 
                         spy needs --

                                     REGGIE
                         Agent.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes -- That all he needs is a code 
                         book and a cyanide pill and he's in 
                         business.

                                     REGGIE
                         What's all this got to do with me, 
                         Mr. Bartholomew?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (his mouth full)
                         Your husband was wanted by the U. S. 
                         government.

                                     REGGIE
                         May I have a sandwich, please?

               He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         To be more specific, he was wanted 
                         by this agency.

                                     REGGIE
                              (eating)
                         So that was it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes. We knew him, of course, by his 
                         real name.

                                     REGGIE
                              (almost choking)
                         His -- real -- ?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, 
                         Mrs. Voss --
                              (taking a photo from 
                              his desk)
                         -- I'd like you to look at this 
                         photograph, please -- by the way, 
                         you saw this one, didn't you?
                              (indicating the kids 
                              on the desk)
                         Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.

                                     REGGIE
                         Very sweet.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Aren't they?  Now look at this one, 
                         Mrs. Voss, and --

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop calling me that! Lampert's the 
                         name on the marriage license.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes -- and tell me if you recognize 
                         anyone. Just a moment. Have a good 
                         look.

               He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which 
               he gives her.

               FOUR MEN, all in army uniform, sitting behind a table. The 
               glass is held over the first, magnifying the face.

               CLOSER SHOT -- PHOTO

               It's a photo of a young CHARLES LAMPERT.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's Charles!

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Very good.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         He looks so young -- when was this 
                         taken?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         1944. The next face, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the next man -- a young TEX.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's the man who came to the funeral 
                         yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a 
                         tall man in a corduroy suit and string 
                         tie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Does the name Tex Penthollow mean 
                         anything to you?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Next, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the third face -- a young GIDEON.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes -- and he was there, too -- a 
                         little fatter now -- and less hair -- 
                         but it's the same one.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. 
                         Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         The last one, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the fourth face -- a young 
               SCOBIE.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's a face you don't forget -- he 
                         was there too --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Herman Scobie. And you've never seen 
                         him before, either?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No, thank heaven.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (a pause, regarding 
                              her)
                         Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a 
                         great deal of danger.

                                     REGGIE
                         Danger? Why should I be in any danger?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         You're Charles Voss's wife -- now 
                         that he's dead you're their only 
                         lead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying 
                         to frighten me you're doing a really 
                         first-rate job!
                              (she takes another 
                              sandwich)

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         it's your only chance.

                                     REGGIE
                         Gladly, only I don't know what you 
                         want! You haven't told me.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. 
                         Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 
                         Charles Voss received from the 
                         auction. Those three men want it, 
                         too -- they want it very badly.

                                     REGGIE
                         But it's Charles's money, not theirs.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (laughing)
                         Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see 
                         you try and convince them of that!
                              (drying his eyes)
                         Oh, dear.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then whose is it? His or theirs?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Ours.

                                     REGGIE
                              (she looks at him for 
                              a moment)
                         Oh, I see.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         And I'm afraid we want it back.

                                     REGGIE
                         But I don't have it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's impossible. You're the only 
                         one who could have it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the 
                         truth.

               BARTHOLOMEW is silent for a moment, thinking.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I believe you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Thanks very much.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Oh, you've got the money all right -- 
                         you just don't know you've got it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter 
                         of a million dollars, believe me, 
                         I'd know it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've 
                         got it.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean it's just lying around 
                         someplace -- all that cash?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Or a safe deposit key, a certified 
                         check, a baggage claim -- you look 
                         for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite 
                         sure you'll find it.

                                     REGGIE
                         But --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look 
                         just as hard and as fast as you can. 
                         You may not have a great deal of 
                         time. Those men know you have it 
                         just as surely as we do. You won't 
                         be safe until the money's in our 
                         hands. Is that clear?

               REGGIE nods. He writes something on a pad of paper and tears 
               it off, handing it to her.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Here's where you're to call me -- 
                         day or night. It's a direct line to 
                         both my office and my apartment. 
                         Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and 
                         please don't tell anyone about coming 
                         to see me. It could prove fatal for 
                         them as well as yourself.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wait a minute -- you think those 
                         three men killed Charles, don't you?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We've no proof, of course, but we 
                         rather think so, yes.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, there you are! Charles had the 
                         money with him -- so whoever killed 
                         him has it -- they have it!

               BARTHOLOMEW shakes his head.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why not?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (grimly)
                         Because they're still here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid 
                         you're in a great deal of danger. 
                         Remember what happened to Charles.

               REGGIE takes the last sandwich and begins eating furiously.

               DELETED

               EXT. ESPLANADE DES CHAMPS-ELYÉES -- DAY

               MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL.

               One of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain 
               days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between 
               the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment, 
               Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of 
               CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard.

               VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN

               Sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their 
               attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended 
               by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the 
               slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are 
               laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention 
               caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low 
               for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin.

               After a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over 
               the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice.

               [Throughout the following scene the CHILDREN and the ACTORS 
               can be heard in the b.g.]

                                     PETER
                         Reggie -- ?

               She turns and looks at him for a moment.

                                     REGGIE
                              (vaguely)
                         Hallo, Peter.

                                     PETER
                         You telephoned me to meet you. I've 
                         been standing on the corner back 
                         there -- waiting for you.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry -- I heard the children 
                         laughing.

               A ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the 
               stage.

                                     PETER
                         What's going on?

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't you understand French?

                                     PETER
                         I'm still having trouble with English.

                                     REGGIE
                         The man and the woman are married --

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               PUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes, I can see that -- they're batting 
                         each other over the head with clubs.

               Finally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing 
               a three-cornered hat appears.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who's that with the hat?

               MED SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               Wearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's the policeman -- he wants to 
                         arrest Judy for killing Punch.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               JUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What's she saying now?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That she's innocent -- she didn't do 
                         it.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         She did it, all right -- take it 
                         from me.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I believe her.

               PUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says 
               something, then ducks out.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who was that?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Punch, of course.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

                                     PETER
                         Of course? I thought he was dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         He's only pretending, to teach her a 
                         lesson -- only --
                              (her face clouding)
                         only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- 
                         he's not pretending. Somebody threw 
                         him off a train. What am I going to 
                         do?

               Charles was mixed up in something terrible.

                                     PETER
                         I wish you'd let me help you. Whatever 
                         it is, it doesn't sound like the 
                         sort of thing that a woman can handle 
                         all by herself.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               JUDY has gotten the upper hand is now batting the POLICEMAN's 
               brains out.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

                                     PETER
                         Have you got a mirror?
                              (she nods)
                         Give it to me.

               She hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face.

                                     PETER
                         Right there, between your eyes -- 
                         see? Worry lines. You're much too 
                         young and too pretty to have anything 
                         like that. How about making me vice-
                         president in charge of cheering you 
                         up?

                                     REGGIE
                              (jumping at the 
                              suggesting)
                         Starting tonight?

               INT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- EMCEE.

               He stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin 
               dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional 
               smile as he speaks into a mike.

                                     EMCEE
                         Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good 
                         evening ladies and gentlemen, guten 
                         Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce 
                         soir, comme tous les soirs, 
                         l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep 
                         Club, c'est vous! Venez, mesdames et 
                         messieurs, step right up, ladies and 
                         gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine 
                         Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e 
                         signori -- avanti!

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

               At their table. REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress.

                                     PETER
                         What was all that?

                                     REGGIE
                         Fun and games. Evidently we're the 
                         floorshow.

                                     PETER
                         You mean you and me?

                                     REGGIE
                         No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, 
                         avanti!

               She rises and pulls him along.

               WIDE ANGLE

               Including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it, 
               laughing self-consciously and looking around.

                                     EMCEE
                         Écoutez bien -- les règles sont tres 
                         simples -- the rules are very easy -- 
                         deux équipes -- two teams -- each 
                         with one orange -- une orange -- 
                         eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia -- 
                         held under the chin, like so --
                              (does it)
                         comme ça -- and passed to the player 
                         behind you -- sans vous servir de 
                         vos mains -- using nothing but the 
                         chin -- no hands -- and keeping the 
                         orange at all costs from touching 
                         the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et 
                         Messieurs -- begin, ladies and 
                         gentlemen -- signore e signori, 
                         comminciate!

               The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons 
               to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. 
               REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.

               Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one 
               under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man 
               at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the 
               game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women 
               behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under 
               their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using 
               their hands.

               (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's 
               partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against 
               the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly 
               enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next 
               in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest 
               miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of 
               human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-
               ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the 
               orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can 
               only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide 
               from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on 
               the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve 
               it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity 
               which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even 
               new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be 
               a torment for total strangers and/or the English).

               VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME

               Some of the couples in various states of confusion, 
               entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, 
               hilarious.

               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL

               It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but 
               quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an 
               abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the 
               twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber 
               the game but increase his worldly experience.

               The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to 
               move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success 
               difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange 
               starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after 
               it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               She is enjoying it thoroughly.

               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL

               Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, 
               PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilà, grips the orange 
               under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations 
               from members of his TEAM.

               Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment.

                                     PETER
                         En garde.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lay on, MacDuff.

               They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all 
               possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers 
               seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they 
               are too good despite themselves and the transfer is 
               accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.

               REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, 
               turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an 
               embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, 
               the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in 
               BARTHOLOMEW's photo.

               REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.

               Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly 
               in REGGIE's ear.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON

               Her eyes show her fright as he whispers:

                                     GIDEON
                         Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE
                         What do you want?

                                     GIDEON
                         Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Tell me what?

                                     GIDEON
                         It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         you do know that, don't you?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know anything.

                                     GIDEON
                         Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you 
                         could wake up dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Leave me alone -- !

                                     GIDEON
                         Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's 
                         news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE (SHOUTING)
                         Stop it!

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE'S AND GIDEON'S FEET

               As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

               He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he 
               merely closes his eyes.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well 
               as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward.

                                     PETER
                         Reggie -- what's the trouble?

               REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance.

               She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, 
               under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him 
               for a moment.

                                     REGGIE
                         He -- he was stepping on my foot.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

               Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling 
               down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange.

                                     GIDEON
                         Forgive me -- it was quite 
                         unintentional, I'm sure.

               WIDER ANGLE

               GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes.

                                     REGGIE
                              (starting off)
                         Wait for me -- I won't be long.

               She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a 
               flight of stairs.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER

               Watching her go, a concerned look on his face.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT

               A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's-
               women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door.

               The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes 
               down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light 
               and closing the door after her.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops 
               it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one 
               given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on 
               it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into 'phone)
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie 
                         Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew: 
                         I've seen one of the
                              (she stops)
                         Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me?

               She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her 
               coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice.

                                     REGGIE
                         Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, 
                         Regina Lam...

               Suddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to 
               look, slamming the receiver down as she does.

               REVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               TEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo), 
               the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the 
               doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in 
               his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the 
               door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified.

                                     TEX
                         Howdy, Miz Lampert.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wha -- what do you want?

               TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket.

                                     TEX
                         You know what I want, Miz Lampert...

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- no, I'm don't.

                                     TEX
                         Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd 
                         better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- 
                         cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!

               He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the 
               burning match in his hand afterward.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know what --

               TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the 
               booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically.

                                     REGGIE
                         What are you doing?

               TEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She 
               beats this one out too.

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop that!

                                     TEX
                         Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

               He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with 
               it. She shrinks back.

                                     TEX
                         It could get a whole lot worse.

               Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he 
               punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE 
               is too busy beating them out to do anything else.

                                     TEX
                         It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an'

                         ain't gonna be worth the paper it's 
                         printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', 
                         Miz Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Please stop -- please!

                                     TEX
                         You think on it real careful-like, 
                         Miz Lampert -- y'hear?

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her 
               work.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're insane, absolutely insane!

               She looks up, then blinks her eyes.

               INT. 'PHONE BOOTH OVER REGGIE'S SHOULDER

               There is no one there. REGGIE rises and steps out of the 
               booth.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE looks around. There is no one there.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH

               As REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into 
               the slot. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back 
               into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her 
               mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her 
               eyes.

               Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time 
               it is PETER.

                                     PETER
                         What are you doing in here?

                                     REGGIE
                              (a sigh of relief)
                         Having a nervous breakdown.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby.

                                     PETER
                         You haven't said a word since we 
                         left the club -- what happened back 
                         there?

                                     REGGIE
                         I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to 
                         tell you or not.

                                     PETER
                         I don't think I follow you.

                                     REGGIE
                         He said if I told anybody it could 
                         prove fatal for them as well as me.

                                     PETER
                         Who said?

                                     REGGIE
                         That's what I'm not supposed to say.

                                     PETER
                         Stop this nonsense! If you're in 
                         some sort of trouble I want to know 
                         about it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying 
                         me.

                                     PETER
                         I wasn't --

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, you were -- you called it 
                         nonsense. Being murdered in cold 
                         blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it 
                         happens to you sometime.

               She goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT 
               CLERK greets them sleepily.

                                     NIGHT CLERK
                         Bonsoir.

                                     REGGIE
                         Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s'il vous 
                         plait.

               The NIGHT CLERK gets the key off a hook and hands it to 
               REGGIE.

                                     NIGHT CLERK
                         Bonne nuit.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to PETER)
                         Would you mind seeing me to the door?

                                     PETER
                         Of course not.

               They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat 
               cramped, forcing them to stand close together.

                                     REGGIE
                         This is quite a place for making 
                         friends, isn't it?

               He presses the button and the elevator starts to rise.

                                     PETER
                         You said this afternoon that your 
                         husband was mixed up in something.

                                     REGGIE
                              (busy examining the 
                              cleft in his chin)
                         How do you shave in there?

                                     PETER
                         What was it?

                                     REGGIE
                         What was what?

                                     PETER
                         What your husband was mixed up in.

                                     REGGIE
                         Look, I know it's asking you to 
                         stretch your imagination, but can't 
                         you pretend for a moment that I'm a 
                         woman and that you're a --

                                     PETER
                         Don't you know I could already be 
                         arrested for transporting a minor 
                         above the first floor?

               The elevator stops.

                                     PETER
                         We're here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Where?

                                     PETER
                         On the street where you live.

                                     REGGIE
                         How about once more around the park?

               He reaches across her and opens the door.

                                     PETER
                         Out.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE leaves the elevator, followed by PETER. They walk 
               to her door. There is a moment of silence as she looks at 
               him.

                                     REGGIE
                              (imitating PETER)
                         Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a 
                         nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it 
                         is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, 
                         all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll 
                         behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, 
                         I never make promises I can't keep.'

                                     PETER
                         How would you like a spanking?

                                     REGGIE
                         How would you like a punch in the 
                         nose? Stop treating me like a child.

                                     PETER
                         Then stop acting like one. If you're 
                         really in some kind of trouble, I'd 
                         like to hear about it. Otherwise, 
                         it's late, I'm tired and I'm going 
                         home to bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you know what's wrong with you?

                                     PETER
                         What?

                                     REGGIE
                         Nothing. Good night.

                                     PETER
                         Good night.

               He turns and leaves. She smiles slightly, then turns and 
               puts the key into the door and opens it.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Featuring the door. REGGIE enters, then stops abruptly, the 
               doorknob still in her hand.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is 
               HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat.

               He starts slowly advancing toward REGGIE.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Where is it, lady -- where've you 
                         got it?

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

                                     REGGIE
                              (terrified)
                         I don't know -- I don't know! I don't --

               She stops as she sees something.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND

               Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one.

               WIDER ANGLE

               SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, 
               then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.

                                     SCOBIE
                         I want it -- give it to me -- it's 
                         mine!

               The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly, 
               turns and flies out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (screaming)
                         Peter -- ! Peter -- !

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal 
               hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and 
               splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified 
               with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding 
               claw.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand.

                                     REGGIE
                         A man -- he tried to kill me!

               Pulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the 
               outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using 
               all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, 
               making sure to hold it that way as he steps in.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled 
               SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but 
               he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, 
               sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, 
               head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he 
               disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door 
               and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free.

               He then rushes to the open window and climbs out.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly 
               looks into the room.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (entering cautiously)
                         Peter -- ?
                              (alarmed)
                         Peter! Where are you?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Showing the disarranged room, empty of people. Then, slowly 
               PETER's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily.

               REGGIE rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Peter -- are you all right?

                                     PETER
                         I think I sprained my pride.
                              (He looks around)
                         Where'd he go?

                                     REGGIE
                         Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't 
                         see him.

               PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks 
               out. He then turns back.

                                     PETER
                         Lock the door and the window -- and 
                         don't let anyone in except me. I'll 
                         be back in a minute.

                                     REGGIE
                         Be careful, Peter.

                                     PETER
                              (one leg over the 
                              sill)
                         You took the words right out of my 
                         mouth.

               He climbs out.

               EXT. HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT

               Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, 
               consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between 
               it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears 
               and looks down over the railing.

               EXT. HOTEL SIDEWALK (FROM ABOVE) -- NIGHT

               SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it 
               is too far to jump.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY

               He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on 
               one side, but there are two or three on the other.

               PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one 
               hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER'S HAND

               As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short 
               of touching it.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he straightens up and prepares to jump.

               EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT

               From the GROUND. PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony. He sees 
               a light coming through the window and looks in.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oh!

               PETER leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing 
               on his way to the next balcony. As he does, the following 
               exchange is heard (in British English).

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What is it now, Pamela?

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It happened again, Henry -- another 
                         strange man peered in the window at 
                         me and then went away.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Bad luck, Pamela.

               EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT

               From the GROUND as PETER jumps to the next balcony.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a 
               light coming from this window, too. PETER looks in.

               MED. SHOT -- WINDOW -- OVER PETER'S SHOULDER

               Inside the room are GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of 
               a heated discussion.

                                     GIDEON
                         That was a dumb move, Herman -- a 
                         dumb move.

                                     TEX
                         And then some. If you'd only told us 
                         you was goin' to her room we could've 
                         kept 'em busy --

               INT. GIDEON'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                         -- but sneakin' in there on your own 
                         that-a-way, why, man, you was bound 
                         to get yore tokus kicked. I mean, 
                         what'd you think he'd do -- walk up 
                         'n' shake you by that hand o' yores?

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's right, Herman -- you didn't 
                         leave me much choice.

               They all turn toward the window.

               WIDER ANGLE

               As PETER climbs in through the window and joins them.

                                     PETER
                              (to SCOBIE)
                         I didn't hurt you, did I?

               SCOBIE shakes his head and turns away.

                                     GIDEON
                              (eagerly)
                         Never mind that -- did you get the 
                         money?

                                     PETER
                         How could I with the three Marx 
                         Brothers breathing down my neck? You 
                         said you'd let me handle it alone --
                         ! The girl trusts me. If she's got 
                         it, I'll find out about it. But you've 
                         got to leave me alone.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (to GIDEON and TEX)
                         We took all the chances. The money 
                         belongs to us, not him!

                                     TEX
                         Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- 
                         don't forget he done us a little ol' 
                         favor.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Yeah? What's that?

                                     TEX
                         He took care of Charlie for us.

                                     GIDEON
                              (to PETER)
                         We appreciate it, really we do.

                                     SCOBIE
                         But who asked him? Three shares are 
                         enough -- I'd say he's out!

                                     PETER
                         A third of nothing is nothing, Herman. 
                         Make up your minds -- she's waiting 
                         for me.

                                     GIDEON
                              (thoughtfully)
                         I don't see how another twenty-four 
                         hours could hurt.

                                     TEX
                         Shoot no, not after all these years.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Then he gets it out of your share, 
                         not mine! Not mine!

               SCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it.

               GIDEON begins sneezing, takes a bottle of pills from his 
               pocket and swallows two white tablets.

                                     GIDEON
                         I suggest you get about your business -- 
                         nothing soothes Herman like success.

                                     TEX
                              (chuckling)
                         That's right -- it's like ticklin' a 
                         alligator's belly.

                                     PETER
                         Who's got the room next to hers?

                                     TEX
                         Me. How come?

                                     PETER
                         Get another one, will you? I'm going 
                         to need it.

               PETER starts for the door.

                                     TEX
                         If you do find the money -- you won't 
                         forget t' tell us about it, will 
                         you, fella?

                                     PETER
                              (turning at the door)
                         Don't worry.

                                     TEX
                         Oh, I ain't worryin' -- but see this 
                         pudgy little fella here?
                              (indicating GIDEON)
                         He worries -- an' he's even meaner'n 
                         I am.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As she waits anxiously, smoking a cigarette. There is a KNOCK 
               at the door.

                                     REGGIE
                         Who is it?

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's me. Peter.

               REGGIE unlocks the door and opens it. PETER enters and she 
               closes the door again --

                                     PETER
                         There was no trace of him. All right, 
                         Reggie -- suppose you tell me what 
                         this is all about.

                                     REGGIE
                         There are three men -- he's one of 
                         them -- they think I have something 
                         that belongs to them.

                                     PETER
                         What?

                                     REGGIE
                         A quarter of a million dollars.

               PETER is silent for a moment.

                                     PETER
                         Go on.

                                     REGGIE
                         That's all.

                                     PETER
                         No, it isn't -- where's the money?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.  Those men killed 
                         Charles to get it. But he must not 
                         have had it with him on the train.

                                     PETER
                         So they think he left it with you.

                                     REGGIE
                         But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --
                              (tears welling)
                         And if I don't find it --
                              (wailing)
                         Those men going to kill me.

               She falls in his arms to be comforted.

                                     PETER
                         No, they won't -- I won't let them.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sobbing)
                         Please help me, Peter -- you're the 
                         only one I can trust.

                                     PETER
                         Of course I'll help -- I told you I 
                         would, didn't I? Come on now --

               He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm so hungry I could faint.
                              (trying to smile)
                         I've -- I've gotten your suit all 
                         wet.

                                     PETER
                         That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.

                                     REGGIE
                         Peter, you've got to promise me 
                         something. Promise you'll never lie 
                         the way Charles did. Why do people 
                         have to tell lies?

                                     PETER
                         Usually it's because they want 
                         something -- and they're afraid the 
                         truth won't get it for them.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you tell lies?

               A pause. The phone rings. REGGIE answers it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello?

               INT. OUTDOOR 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               SCOBIE holds the receiver in his metal hand.

                         Mrs. Lampert? -- it's me -- the man 
                         who was in your room a few minutes 
                         ago --

                         The man who hit me, lady -- Dyle -- 
                         that's his name. What's wrong -- is 
                         he still there?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE's back is turned to PETER so he can't see her face.

               He watches her.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes -- that's right.

                                     PETER
                         What is it, Reggie -- what's he 
                         saying?

               She shakes her head.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

                                     SCOBIE

                         Don't trust him -- don't tell him 
                         anything. He's after the money.

               He hangs up.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Slowly, REGGIE lowers the 'phone from her ear and hangs it 
               up.  She hesitates a moment.

                                     PETER
                         What'd he say?

                                     REGGIE
                         He -- he said if I didn't give the 
                         money, he'll kill me.

                                     PETER
                         I wouldn't take that too seriously.

                                     REGGIE
                         I believe what he said.

                                     PETER
                         They're only trying to scare you, 
                         that's all.

                                     REGGIE
                         How do you know what they're doing?

                                     PETER
                         I don't -- but as long as they think 
                         you have the money, or know where it 
                         is, or have it without knowing where 
                         it is, or don't even know you have 
                         it --

                                     REGGIE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     PETER
                         You mustn't let what he said bother 
                         you. It was only words.

                                     REGGIE
                              (softly)
                         Words can hurt very much.

                                     PETER
                              (a pause)
                         Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the 
                         morning.

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't put yourself out.

                                     PETER
                         Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember 
                         that.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, I'll remember. Good night.

                                     PETER
                         Good night.

               He starts out, pausing by the door and examining the hole 
               SCOBIE made in it.

                                     PETER
                         But if you'll take my advice --
                              (smiling)
                         You'll undress in the closet. Oh, 
                         and if you need me, just bang on the 
                         wall. I'll be next door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes 
               the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, 
               then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one 
               of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- 
               and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock 
               has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down 
               near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of 
               the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the 
               thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it 
               underneath.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As DYLE enters, the thread in his hand. He goes to a nearby 
               table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key, 
               which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE is on the phone.

                                     REGGIE
                              (excited)
                         -- But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew -- 
                         what I called to tell you was there's 
                         someone else -- someone who wasn't 
                         in that photograph you showed me. He 
                         says his name is Peter Joshua -- but 
                         it isn't -- it's Dyle.
                              (a pause)
                         Mr. Bartholomew? -- are you still 
                         there?

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               BARTHOLOMEW on the phone. He is silent for a moment, his 
               face troubled.

                         I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, 
                         but it's just possible we were wrong 
                         about who killed your husband.

                         Bartholomew, I'm catching the next 
                         plane out of here -- I'm not going 
                         to sit here and wait for someone to

               DELETED

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE hangs up the phone, picks up her bag, checks her hair 
               in the mirror, then starts for the door. She stops as she 
               notices the connecting door leading to the room next door, 
               DYLE's room. She goes to it, silently slips out the key and 
               bends to peer through the keyhole.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT (THROUGH KEYHOLE)

               DYLE is removing his coat. Before he lays it over a chair, 
               he takes a gun from the inside pocket, checks it, and tucks 
               it into his belt.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE reacts in surprise and fright, jumps quickly away 
               from the door. She hurries to the door leading to the hall 
               and reaches for the knob.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROOM KEY. The thread attached to it is pulled 
               (by the action of REGGIE's door opening) and the key falls 
               to the floor with a clatter.

               WIDE ANGLE

               Including DYLE as he reacts, his head wheeling to look at 
               the key. Snatching his coat, he runs for the door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE sneaks past DYLE's door. When she has passed, the 
               door opens and DYLE appears. REGGIE takes off on the run, 
               turning the corner and starting down the stairs.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- !

               He starts after her.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               It is deserted, except for the sleeping NIGHT PORTER, as 
               REGGIE comes running down the stairs.

                                     DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Reggie... !

               She turns, looking back towards the sound of his voice, but 
               does not slacken her speed. She runs out the front door.

               EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE runs out. She looks up the street, sees a TAXI and 
               hails it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Taxi -- !

               It pulls over to the curb. Looking once more over her shoulder 
               she takes a bill out of her pocket, opens the cab door, slams 
               it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the driver.

                                     REGGIE
                         N'importe où -- vite! Allez-y!

               She jumps back into the shadows of a nearby doorway as the 
               TAXI pulls away. At the same time DYLE runs out of the hotel.  
               Another TAXI is coming down the street. DYLE hails it 
               frantically.

                                     DYLE
                         Taxi -- ! Taxi -- !

               It pulls up and DYLE opens the door.

                                     DYLE
                              (pointing)
                         Follow that taxi.

                                     DRIVER
                         Comment?

                                     DYLE
                         Taxi! Follow!

                         Je ne comprends rien.

               Desperately, DYLE reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out 
               a small dictionary and begins flipping through the pages.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               In the shadows. She lifts her eyes in annoyance.

               REGGIE comes out of the shadows, looks after DYLE's taxi, 
               then hails another one which pulls up.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to DRIVER)
                         Aux Halles -- vite!

               EXT. LES HALLES -- NIGHT

               REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW walking. The Central Market is teeming 
               with activity -- trucks creeping around other trucks, cases 
               of fruit and vegetables stacked on every inch of sidewalk, 
               WORKERS of all types milling around, unloading trucks and 
               stacking crates, little electric carts scooting in and out -- 
               and nearby, one of the huge, high-roofed sheds where the 
               butchers work.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW

               CAMERA LEADING them as they walk.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking around)
                         Incredible, isn't it? Zola called it 
                         'le ventre de Paris' -- the womb of 
                         Paris, the belly.

               She takes a banana from a nearby stall.

                                     REGGIE
                              (peeling it)
                         What did you want to see me about, 
                         Mr. Bartholomew?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (leaves a coin on the 
                              crate)
                         Were you followed?

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, but I lost him. I really did it 
                         quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to 
                         think women make the best spies.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Agents.

                                     REGGIE
                         He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I 
                         saw it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Who?

                                     REGGIE
                         Dyle, or whatever his name is.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         What does your Mr. Dyle look like, 
                         Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Describe him.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- 
                         rather thin -- in good physical shape, 
                         I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite 
                         handsome, really.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (shaking his head)
                         No.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, what?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's not Carson Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                              (stopping)
                         Carson?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         There's only one Dyle connected with 
                         this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's 
                         Carson.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean you've known about him all 
                         along? Why didn't you tell me?

               BARTHOLOMEW looks at her for a moment, then glances around; 
               his attention is drawn inside the doorway.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         It's enough to make you a vegetarian, 
                         isn't it?

               INT. LES HALLES BUTCHERS' SHED -- NIGHT

               Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, 
               hung on hooks.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW (TRAVELING)

               As REGGIE looks at the hanging beef.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's just lucky that I'm not hanging 
                         next to one of those things right 
                         now.

               She shudders, throws away her banana and turns back to 
               BARTHOLOMEW.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you 
                         tell me you knew about Dyle?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd 
                         better tell me what this thing's all 
                         about.

               INT. LES HALLES BISTRO -- NIGHT

               Lined up at a zinc bar are several BUTCHERS, their white 
               smocks stained with blood. REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW sit at the 
               table.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I suppose you're old enough to have 
                         heard of World War Two?

                                     REGGIE
                         Barely, yes.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- 
                         the military espionage unit -- were 
                         ordered behind the German lines for 
                         the purpose of delivering $250,000 
                         in gold to the French Underground. 
                         The five men --

               A WAITER arrives.

                                     WAITER
                         Vous désirez?

                                     REGGIE
                              (smiling)
                         They always do that.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (to the WAITER)
                         Café.

                                     REGGIE
                         Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade 
                         de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned 
                         on spending the entire night here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Can I at least keep the onion soup?

               BARTHOLOMEW shrugs.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to the WAITER)
                         La soupe tout simplement.

               The WAITER nods and goes.

                                     REGGIE
                              (anxiously)
                         Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- 
                         the French Underground --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes. The five men. They were, of 
                         course, your husband, Charles, the 
                         three men who showed up at his funeral 
                         yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But 
                         something went wrong and they were 
                         unable to locate their contact. It 
                         must have been at that point that 
                         they decided to steal the money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Steal it how?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         By burying it, and then reporting 
                         that the Germans had captured it.  
                         All they had to do was come back 
                         after the war, dig it up and split 
                         it five ways -- a quarter of a million 
                         dollars with no questions asked.

                                     REGGIE
                              (fascinated)
                         May I have a cigarette, please?

               BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at 
               it and rips off the filter tip. He winces.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hate these things -- it's like 
                         drinking coffee through a veil.

               She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches 
               and lights it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Everything went smoothly enough until 
                         after the gold was buried -- then, 
                         before they could get out, they were 
                         ambushed by a German patrol. A machine 
                         gun separated Scobie from his right 
                         hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full 
                         in the stomach.

               REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the 
               filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         What's wrong with that one?

               He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically 
               brand-new in the ashtray.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened 
                         then?

               She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly 
               examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first 
               cigarette.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Have you any idea what these things 
                         cost over here?

                                     REGGIE
                         Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- 
                         what happened then?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Scobie was able to travel, but Carson 
                         Dyle was clearly dying, so they --

               The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup.

                                     WAITER
                         La soupe, c'est pour qui?

                                     REGGIE
                         Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

               The WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Carson was dying so they were forced 
                         to leave him. They finally got back 
                         to the base, made their report, and 
                         waited for the war to end. Only 
                         Charles couldn't wait quite as long 
                         as the others. He beat them back to 
                         the gold, took everything for himself 
                         and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, 
                         Tex and Scobie all this time to catch 
                         up with him again.

                                     REGGIE
                         But if they stole all that money -- 
                         why can't you arrest them?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We know what happened from the bits 
                         and pieces we were able to paste 
                         together -- but we still have no 
                         proof.

                                     REGGIE
                         But what has all this got to do with 
                         the C.I.O.?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an 
                         extension of the wartime O.S.S. It 
                         was our money and we want it back.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but 
                         nothing you've told me has changed 
                         my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- 
                         tonight.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.  
                         You'd better consider what happened 
                         to your husband when he tried to 
                         leave. Those men won't be very far 
                         away -- no matter where you go. In 
                         fact, I don't even see any point in 
                         your changing hotels. Please help 
                         us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is 
                         counting on you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, if I'm going to die, I might 
                         as well do it for my country.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's the spirit.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh, stop it. What do you want me to 
                         do?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We're anxious to know who this man 
                         is -- the one calling himself Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                         Maybe he really is Dyle. He could 
                         still be alive.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         No, Mrs. Lampert.

                                     REGGIE
                         But no one actually saw him die.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is 
                         registered with the War Department 
                         in Washington.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Then who's this one?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I don't know -- but I think you'd 
                         better find out, don't you?

                                     REGGIE
                         Me? Why me?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         You're in an ideal position -- he 
                         trusts you.
                              (grinning)
                         Besides, you said yourself, women 
                         make the best spies.

                                     REGGIE
                              (resigned)
                         Agents.

               EXT. HOTEL (PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS) -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment 
               later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches 
               DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the 
               hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding 
               her from view.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, 
               then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns 
               off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE 
               passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the 
               middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and 
               turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, 
               and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her 
               way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, 
               her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged 
               TOURIST.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST

               The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, 
               looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and 
               she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she 
               smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it.

               He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her.

               REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST

               The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he 
               opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, 
               rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused 
               TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some 
               money on the table and starts after her.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               REGGIE following DYLE. As she passes the GIRL painting, she 
               cannot resist turning to see the work.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PAINTING

               An abstract jumble, nothing recognizable.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she looks from the painting to reality.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               As the scene really looks.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               She shrugs, continues after DYLE. Now we see that the TOURIST, 
               in turn, is following her.

                                     TOURIST
                              (calling)
                         Fraulein --

               REGGIE doesn't stop.

                                     TOURIST
                         Fraulein --

                                     REGGIE
                              (turning but continuing)
                         What are you doing, following me? 
                         Stop it -- we're going to look like 
                         a parade.

               She continues after DYLE. The TOURIST hesitates, then 
               continues after her.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to 
               cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him. He 
               turns back in REGGIE's direction.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she 
               turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with 
               him back toward the cafe.

                                     REGGIE
                              (smiling and rattling 
                              on)
                         How are you? When did you arrive in 
                         town? Are you enjoying Paris? It's 
                         lovely, isn't it? So many wonderful 
                         things to see and do, it makes one's 
                         head spin to think of it.

               She looks back over her shoulder and sees that DYLE is now 
               crossing the Rue Danton, heading for the platform of a bus 
               now stopped at the curb.

                                     TOURIST
                              (smiling)
                         Fraulein --

               REGGIE pulls away from him.

                                     REGGIE
                         If you don't stop following me I'll 
                         call the police.

               She leaves him standing there, more confused than ever, as 
               she starts after DYLE again.

               DYLE has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away.

               REGGIE hurries across the street, hailing a taxi.

                                     REGGIE
                         Taxi -- !

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE enters. CAMERA PANNING with him to the head of a stairway 
               leading downstairs, a sign indicating that it leads to the 
               "MAIL ROOM & TELEPHONES." CAMERA PANS back to the door as 
               REGGIE enters.

               DELETED

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS MAIL ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE walks to one of several windows. A sign over it reading:

                                         "A - D."

               MED. SHOT -- STAIRS

               REGGIE comes down the stairs. Suddenly she stops.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               CAMERA ZOOMS in to sign on "D."

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               A confused look on her face.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               As his turn comes, he addresses the CLERK

                                     DYLE
                         Dyle, please... D - Y - L - E.

                                     CLERK
                         Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               Watching.

               MED. SHOT -- MAIL WINDOW

               The CLERK takes out a bundle of letters and quickly sorts 
               through it.

                                     CLERK
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle -- nothing today.

                                     DYLE
                         Thanks -- see you soon.

               He turns and heads out, starting up the stairs where REGGIE 
               was but is no longer. As he reaches the fourth or fifth step, 
               a VOICE is heard over the loudspeaker.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mr. Dyle, please -- you're wanted on 
                         the telephone -- Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4.

               DYLE stops in his tracks, pondering what to do.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4, please.

               He stops and comes down the stairs, going to the back of the 
               room and into the cabin marked "4."

                                     DYLE
                              (picking up the phone)
                         Yes?

               CAMERA DOLLIES across an empty cabin to discover REGGIE in 
               the third one, on the phone.

               INT. REGGIE'S CABIN

               REGGIE on the phone. 

               INT. DYLE'S CABIN

               DYLE on the phone.

                                     REGGIE
                         Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie?

                                     REGGIE
                         It's the only name I've got. How 
                         about you?

                                     DYLE
                         No cat and mouse -- you've got me. 
                         What do you want to know?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why you lied to me.

                                     DYLE
                         I had to -- for all I knew you could 
                         have been in on the whole thing.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, you know now, so please tell 
                         me who you are.

                                     DYLE
                         But you know my name -- it's Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                         Carson Dyle is dead.

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, he is. He was my brother.

                                     REGGIE
                         Your --

                                     DYLE
                         The army thinks he was killed in 
                         action by the Germans, but I think 
                         they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- 
                         and your husband -- because he 
                         wouldn't go along with their scheme 
                         to steal the gold. I think he 
                         threatened to turn them in and they 
                         killed him. I'm trying to prove it. 
                         They think I'm working with them. 
                         But I'm not, and that's the truth. 
                         I'm on your side, Reggie -- please 
                         believe that.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can I? You lied to me -- the way 
                         Charles did -- and after promising 
                         you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe 
                         you, Peter... oh, but I can't call 
                         you that anymore, can I? It will 
                         take me a while to get used to your 
                         new name -- which I don't even know 
                         yet. What is it?
                              (pause)
                         Aren't you going to tell me?
                              (pause)
                         Hello -- ?

               She opens the door of the cabin and starts out.

               MED. SHOT -- PHONE CABINS

               As REGGIE steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the 
               others. They are all occupied except one and she looks inside 
               it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EMPTY CABIN

               The receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she looks at it, confused.

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- DAY

               DYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator, 
               SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (quietly)
                         If you do anything funny, or try to 
                         talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- 
                         here and now. Okay?

                                     DYLE
                         You'll wreck your raincoat.

               The self-service elevator doors open, one or two PASSENGERS 
               come out and DYLE and SCOBIE enter. A young GIRL starts in 
               after them.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Next car, please.

               He reaches out and presses the top button with his metal 
               hand. The doors close.

               DELETED

               INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON

               As SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks 
               around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall. 
               He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door, 
               which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, 
               leading up to a second floor.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Okay -- turn around.

               DYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing 
               at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes 
               to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him.

               Finding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE 
               removes it. During the following conversation he will shake 
               open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out 
               onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE.  
               Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Sit down.

               Shrugging, DYLE sits on the third step.

                                     DYLE
                         What now?

                                     SCOBIE
                         We wait -- with our mouths shut.

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- NIGHT

               The last EMPLOYEES leave the building as the WATCHMAN locks 
               the front door after them.

               INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

               In the semi-darkness, DYLE is still sitting on the third 
               step, SCOBIE still facing him with a gun.

                                     DYLE
                         How long do you intend -- ?

                                     SCOBIE
                         I said with the mouth shut.

               DYLE yawns wide.

                                     DYLE
                         Sorry about that.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Okay -- up there.

               DYLE gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by 
               SCOBIE. DYLE stops at the door.

                                     DYLE
                         Do I knock or something?

                                     SCOBIE
                         Open it.

               DYLE opens the door. The stairs continue up.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Keep going.

                                     DYLE
                         The view had better be worth it.

               EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

               A spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights 
               beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of 
               roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into 
               a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely 
               separated oval-shaped dormer windows.

               Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven 
               stories.

                                     DYLE
                         Very pretty. Now what?

                                     SCOBIE
                         I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which 
                         is more than you'd give me. Where's 
                         the money?

                                     DYLE
                         Is that why you dragged me all the 
                         way up here -- to ask me that? She 
                         has it -- you know that.

                                     SCOBIE
                         And I say maybe you both have it! 
                         One more time, Dyle -- where is it?

                                     DYLE
                         Supposing I did have it -- which I 
                         don't -- do you really think I'd 
                         hand it over?

                                     SCOBIE
                         You're out, Dyle -- right now!

               SCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Step back.

               DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a 
               sheer drop to the street.

                                     DYLE
                         Back where?

                                     SCOBIE
                         That's the idea.

               Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand 
               with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.

               Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the 
               jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around 
               DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.

               Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and, 
               unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of 
               the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE 
               suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold 
               is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his 
               back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound 
               extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.

               Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and 
               leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple 
               with one another, each trying to break free and reach for 
               the gun.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS

               Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE

               The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are 
               beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to 
               stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by 
               both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold 
               him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, 
               continues to inch forward toward the gun.

               Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining 
               him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his 
               momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, 
               where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the 
               slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW

               As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching 
               sound and causing sparks to fly.

               MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he slides over the edge and disappears.

               CLOSE SHOT -- DYLE

               As he watches, hypnotized.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROOF EDGE

               There appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN 
               FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the 
               rain gutter at the very edge.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of 
               the level part of the roof.

                                     DYLE
                         Herman?

               MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal 
               hand.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Yeah?

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He finds it hard to believe.

                                     DYLE
                         How are you doing?

                                     SCOBIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         How do you think?

                                     DYLE
                         If you get bored, try writing 'Love 
                         thy neighbor' a hundred times on the 
                         side of the building.

               DYLE turns and leaves going down the stairs.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               The HOTEL MANAGER is busy taping a piece of cardboard over 
               the hole ripped in REGGIE's door by SCOBIE's metal hand the 
               night before. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own 
               door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE "takes" the look.

                                     DYLE
                         I didn't do it.

                                     MANAGER
                         The next time madame forgets her 
                         key, there is another one at the 
                         desk.

               DYLE smiles, then enters his room.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               He closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat, 
               wincing.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE, smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears DYLE moving 
               about in his room. She goes to the connecting door, unlocks 
               her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his 
               side and knocks.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is that you?

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE goes to the door, throws back the bolt and opens the 
               door. REGGIE enters.

                                     REGGIE
                         Didn't anyone ever tell you it's 
                         impolite to --
                              (seeing his injured 
                              back)
                         What happened?

                                     DYLE
                         I met a man with sharp nails.

                                     REGGIE
                         Scobie?

                                     DYLE
                         I left him hanging around the American 
                         Express.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come on -- I've got something that 
                         stings like crazy.

               She leads him into her room.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE and DYLE enter from his room. She leads him to the 
               bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Take off your shirt and lie down.

               As REGGIE goes to the bathroom, DYLE takes off his torn shirt, 
               revealing a torn and bloody T-shirt. He lies face downwards 
               on the bed. REGGIE returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape, 
               scissors, and disinfectant. She sits next to him and lifts 
               up his T-shirt to examine the wound.

                                     DYLE
                              (wincing)
                         Listen -- all I really want is an 
                         estimate.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's not so bad. You may not be able 
                         to lie on your back for a few days -- 
                         but, then, you can lie from any 
                         position, can't you?

               She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning 
               the wound. He winces.

                                     REGGIE
                         Does it hurt?

                                     DYLE
                         Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?

               She continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging 
               it while they talk.

                                     REGGIE
                         Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

                                     DYLE
                         Would you like to see my passport?

                                     REGGIE
                         Your passport! What kind of a proof 
                         is that?

                                     DYLE
                         Would you like to see where I was 
                         tattooed?

                                     REGGIE
                         Sure.

                                     DYLE
                         Okay, I'll drive you around there 
                         some day.
                              (his back stinging)
                         Ouch!

                                     REGGIE
                         Ha ha. You could at least tell me 
                         what your first name is these days.

                                     DYLE
                         Alexander.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, but we're divorced.

                                     REGGIE
                         I thought that was Peter Joshua.

                                     DYLE
                              (smiling)
                         I'm no easier to live with than he 
                         was.

                                     REGGIE
                              (finishing the bandage)
                         There -- you're a new man.

               As they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes 
               into his own room. REGGIE remains on the bed, watching him 
               through the open door as he puts on a fresh T-shirt and shirt.

                                     DYLE
                         I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the 
                         truth, but I had to find out your 
                         part in all this.

                                     REGGIE
                         Alex -- how can you tell if someone 
                         is lying or not?

                                     DYLE
                         You can't.

                                     REGGIE
                         There must be some way.

                                     DYLE
                         There's an old riddle about two tribes 
                         of Indians -- the Whitefeet always 
                         tell the truth and the Blackfeet 
                         always lie. So one day you meet an 
                         Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful 
                         Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He 
                         tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, 
                         but which one is he?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why couldn't you just look at his 
                         feet?

                                     DYLE
                         Because he's wearing moccasins.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Well, then he's a truthful 
                         Whitefoot, of course.

                                     DYLE
                         Why not a lying Blackfoot?

                                     REGGIE
                              (confused)
                         Which one are you?

                                     DYLE
                              (entering, smiling)
                         Whitefoot, of course.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come here.

               He goes to the bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Sit down.

               He sits.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope it turns out you're a 
                         Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very 
                         happy hanging around the tepee.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- listen to me --

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly 
                         talk. You forget I'm already a widow.

                                     DYLE
                         So was Juliet -- at fifteen.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm not fifteen.

                                     DYLE
                         Well, there's your trouble right 
                         there -- you're too old for me.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why can't you be serious?

                                     DYLE
                         There, you said it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Said what?

                                     DYLE
                         Serious. When a man gets to be my 
                         age that's the last word he ever 
                         wants to hear. I don't want to be 
                         serious -- and I especially don't 
                         want you to be.

                                     REGGIE
                         Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll 
                         just sit around all day long being 
                         frivolous -- how about that?

               She starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek.

                                     DYLE
                         Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (pulling back)
                         Okay.

                                     DYLE
                         What are you doing?

                                     REGGIE
                         Cutting it out.

                                     DYLE
                         Who told you to do that?

                                     REGGIE
                         You did.

                                     DYLE
                         But I'm not through complaining yet.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh.
                              (She starts kissing 
                              him again)
                          

                                     DYLE
                         Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

                                     REGGIE
                         I think I love you, Alex --

               She kisses him on the mouth. The phone rings. He tries to 
               talk as she continues kissing him.

                                     DYLE
                              (mumbling)
                         The phone's ringing --

                                     REGGIE
                         Whoever it is won't give up -- and 
                         neither will I.

               The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him.

               Finally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the 
               phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths 
               and mumbles into it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on phone)
                         Sorry -- I was just -- uh -- nibbling 
                         on something.

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               TEX speaks into the phone.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, my buddies 'n me, we'd 
                         oblige it mighty highly if you could 
                         mosey on across the hall 'n chew the 
                         fat with us for a spell.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE is watching her.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Can you give me one good reason why 
                         I should?

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout 
                         seven or eight years old. Th' little 
                         tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- 
                         ain't that cute?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               She covers the phone and turns to DYLE in alarm.

                                     REGGIE
                         They've got Jean-Louis!

                                     DYLE
                         That sounds like their problem.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into the phone)
                         I'll be right there.

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                              (on the phone)
                         We'll be waitin' in room forty-seven, 
                         Miz Lampert -- so you just wiggle on 
                         over.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE hangs up.

                                     REGGIE
                         What day is it?

                                     DYLE
                         Tuesday.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie 
                         works late Tuesday nights -- she 
                         always leaves him with me. They 
                         wouldn't do anything to a little 
                         boy, would they?

                                     DYLE
                         I don't know -- it depends on whether 
                         or not they've already eaten.

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- JEAN-LOUIS. He looks around, uncertainly, first 
               one way, then the other. CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him sitting 
               on SCOBIE's knee, the large man holding him with his good 
               hand, the metal one in his pocket. TEX sits next to them 
               while GIDEON nervously paces the floor. When GIDEON begins 
               sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket 
               and downs one or two, swallowing some water.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Hey, Tex -- move the kid to the other 
                         knee or something, will you? My leg's 
                         going to sleep.

               TEX lifts JEAN-LOUIS and puts him down on SCOBIE's other 
               knee.

                                     TEX
                         Upsy-daisy.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Are you a real cowboy?

                                     TEX
                         Sure am.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Then where is your gun?

                                     TEX
                              (taking out his gun)
                         Right here -- see?

                                     GIDEON
                         Will you put that thing away!

               A KNOCK at the door. GIDEON goes to open it. REGGIE and DYLE 
               enter. She sees JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun.

                                     REGGIE
                         Jean-Louis!

               She snatches him off SCOBIE's lap.

                                     TEX
                         Howdy, Miz Lampert.

                              (glaring at DYLE)
                         Who invited you?

                                     DYLE
                         Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, 
                         I see.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'd better call Sylvie -- she must 
                         be frantic.

               She starts for the door with JEAN-LOUIS. GIDEON blocks her 
               way.

                                     GIDEON
                         I'm afraid that will have to wait, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

                         She isn't going to be anybody's mother 
                         unless you answer some questions.

                                               We want that money -- now!

                                     DYLE
                              (forcefully)
                         Be quiet, all of you!

               The THREE MEN look at him, surprised by his tone.

                                     DYLE
                         And stop threatening that boy. He 
                         doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert 
                         doesn't either.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Then who does?

                                     DYLE
                         I don't know, Herman -- maybe you 
                         do.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Me?

                                     DYLE
                              (to TEX)
                         Or you --
                              (to GIDEON)
                         Or you --

                                     GIDEON, TEX & SCOBIE
                              (together)
                         That's the most ridiculous -- !
                         You gone loco?
                         Listen to the man!

                                     DYLE
                         Slowly. Suppose one of you found 
                         Charles here in Paris, followed him, 
                         cornered him on the train, threw him 
                         out the window and took the money.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (after a pause)
                         That's a crock! If one of us did 
                         that he wouldn't hang around here 
                         waiting for the other two to wise 
                         up.

                                     DYLE
                         But he'd have to. If he left he'd be 
                         admitting his guilt -- and the others 
                         would know what happened. Whoever it 
                         is has to wait here, pretending to 
                         look for the money, waiting for the 
                         rest of us to give up and go home. 
                         That's when he'll be safe and not a 
                         minute before.

               A pause as the THREE MEN look at one another.

                                     GIDEON
                         Up till now we always figured she 
                         had the money -- but you know so 
                         much about it, maybe you've got it.

                                     DYLE
                         Then what am I doing here? You didn't 
                         know anything about me -- I'm the 
                         only one who could have taken it and 
                         kept right on going.

                                     SCOBIE
                         He's just tryin' to throw us off! 
                         They've got it, I tell you! Why don't 
                         we search their rooms?

                                     DYLE
                              (exchanging looks 
                              with REGGIE)
                         It's all right with us --

                                     TEX
                              (rising)
                         What are we wastin' time for? Let's 
                         go.

                                     DYLE
                         And while we're waiting, we might as 
                         well go through yours.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (stopping)
                         Not my room!

                                     DYLE
                         What's wrong, Herman -- have you got 
                         something to hide?
                              (a pause, then smiling)
                         Then I take it there are no 
                         objections.

               The THREE MEN look at one another unhappily.

                                     DYLE
                         We'd better exchange keys. Here's 
                         mine.

                                     SCOBIE
                         I'll take that.

               He takes DYLE's key and gives DYLE his. GIDEON goes to REGGIE, 
               takes her key and gives her his own.

                                     TEX
                         Mine's in the door. Ariva durchy, 
                         y'all.

               The THREE MEN file out. DYLE and REGGIE exchange looks.

                                     DYLE
                         Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets 
                         your vote?

                                     REGGIE
                         Scobie -- he's the one that objected.

                                     DYLE
                              (handing her the boy)
                         He's all yours. I'll do Tex and 
                         Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- 
                         and make sure you bolt the door from 
                         inside.

                                     REGGIE
                         Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to 
                         have a treasure hunt.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (joining them)
                         Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will 
                         I win a prize?

                                     REGGIE
                              (to DYLE)
                         What should we give him?

                                     DYLE
                         How about $25,000? Or do you think 
                         it would spoil him?

               She smiles, takes JEAN-LOUIS' hand and leaves. DYLE turns to 
               survey TEX's room.

               He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and 
               the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the 
               desk and opens the drawers -- also empty. The bureau is next -- 
               he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are 
               completely empty. Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens 
               it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare.

               Then, CAMERA PANNING DOWN, he sees the only thing he's found 
               so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- AIRLINES BAG. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include 
               GIDEON, staring down at it as it lies on the table in the 
               center of the room.

                                     GIDEON
                              (eyes on the bag)
                         Tex?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including TEX, busy going through the bureau. He looks up, 
               then joins GIDEON.

                                     TEX
                         What's that?

               GIDEON empties the contents of the bag on the table, then 
               starts examining the various items. He opens the wallet.

               INSERT - WALLET

               Inside, the initials "C.L." are printed in gold.

                                     TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Charlie's stuff?

                                     GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Looks like it.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX & GIDEON

                                     TEX
                         Mebbe we'd better call Herman.

               GIDEON has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter, 
               removing it from the envelope and reading it.

                                     GIDEON
                         What for? If it's not here, why bother 
                         him?

                                     TEX
                         And if it is?

                                     GIDEON
                              (a pause)
                         Why bother him?

               A broad grin from TEX. They continue going through the items 
               from the bag.

                                     TEX
                         You sure nuthin's missin'?

                                     GIDEON
                         No. The police have kindly provided 
                         us with a list.

               TEX takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it 
               in his pocket. They finish with the items from the bag.

                                     TEX
                         There sure ain't nothin' here worth 
                         no quarter of a million.

                                     GIDEON
                         Not unless we're blind.

                                     TEX
                              (staring at GIDEON)
                         You think that mebbe we're fishin' 
                         the wrong stream?

                                     GIDEON
                         Meaning what?

                                     TEX
                         You don't s'pose one o' us has it, 
                         like the man said -- I mean, that'd 
                         be pretty distasteful -- us bein' 
                         vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.

                                     GIDEON
                              (very sincerely)
                         You know I'd tell you if I had it.

                                     TEX
                         Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.

                                     GIDEON
                         Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, 
                         too.

                                     TEX & GIDEON
                              (together)
                         Nachurly!

               The TWO MEN look at one another, then smile -- then laugh.

               DELETED

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE on the phone, JEAN-LOUIS standing by.

                                     REGGIE
                         -- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly. 
                         Just hurry up and get here.

               She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come on, now -- if you wanted to 
                         hide something, where would you put 
                         it?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         I know. I would bury it in the garden.

                                     REGGIE
                         Swell -- only this man doesn't have 
                         a garden.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Oh.
                              (Afterthought)
                         Neither do I.
                              (Seeing something)
                         Voilà!

                                     REGGIE
                         Voilà what?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (pointing)
                         Up there! I would put it up there!

               REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top 
               of the high armoire.

                                     REGGIE
                         You know something, cookie? Why not?

               Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands 
               on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything, 
               by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand 
               over the top and grope around blindly.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope I don't find any little hairy 
                         things living up here -- wait! There 
                         is something! If I can just -- yes, 
                         I'm getting it -- a case of some 
                         sort -- it's heavy.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (jumping up and down)
                         I found it! I found it!

                                     REGGIE
                         If you think you're getting credit 
                         for this, you're crazy.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (ecstatic)
                         We won! We won!

               REGGIE has finally managed to pull down the case -- a 
               rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone 
               case. As he climbs off the chair, JEAN-LOUIS suddenly runs 
               to the door, unbolts it and runs into the hall, CAMERA PANNING 
               with him.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - THIRD LANDING - NIGHT

               As JEAN-LOUIS runs out into the hall, shouting.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         We found it! We found it!

               DYLE is the first one to appear, coming out of GIDEON's room.

               TEX has also appeared from REGGIE's room, followed by GIDEON.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         We found it!

               The THREE MEN rush by JEAN-LOUIS and squeeze simultaneously 
               into SCOBIE's room.

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As DYLE, TEX and GIDEON enter, REGGIE is placing the little 
               straight black chair to its original position. There is no 
               sign of the black case.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- ? Did you find it?

                                     REGGIE
                         No.

                                     GIDEON
                         What do you mean, no?

                                     TEX
                         The kid said --

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (pointing atop the 
                              armoire)
                         Up there! It is up there!

                                     REGGIE
                         No, Jean-Louis.

               TEX grabs the chair and moves it to the armoire, climbing up 
               on it and grabbing the bag.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's nothing, I tell you!

               He brings it to the table as DYLE and GIDEON crowd around 
               him, anxious to see.

               CLOSE SHOTS (PANNING)

               The ring of faces, one at a time. TEX, his jaw muscles working 
               feverishly; DYLE, his eyes unblinking, a slight smile on his 
               lips; GIDEON, his mouth open greedily.

               GROUP SHOT

               As TEX finally springs the latches and opens the lid.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CASE

               Inside, neatly packed in velvet fittings, like the parts of 
               a musical instrument, are various portions of and attachments 
               for a metal artificial hand.

                                     TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Jumpin' frejoles -- it's Herman's 
                         spare.

               GROUP SHOT -- THE THREE MEN

               As they stare at the case, surprised and just a little 
               embarrassed. Slowly TEX lowers the lid. The MEN avoid looking 
               at one another.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS by the door.

                                     REGGIE
                         Where is he?

               The MEN look at one another.

                                     TEX
                         Hey, that's right!

                                     DYLE
                              (already running)
                         He's in my room.

               The THREE MEN hurry past REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS and out of 
               the door.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         What is the matter?

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON, followed by REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS 
               cross the hall to DYLE's room. DYLE turns the key which is 
               still in the door. He enters, followed by the others.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE, TEX and GIDEON stand in the center of the room, looking 
               around. REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS wait in the open doorway. The 
               room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no 
               sign of SCOBIE. The sound of running water can be heard coming 
               from behind the closed door to the bathroom and DYLE is the 
               first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under 
               the door.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- you and the boy better 
                         wait here.

               INT. BATH -- NIGHT

               SCOBIE, still dressed in his raincoat, lies face up, his 
               head submerged in the filled tub, the water now pouring over 
               the edge. His face is distorted. DYLE's hand appears and 
               turns off the water.

               REVERSE SHOT

               DYLE, TEX and GIDEON staring at CAMERA.

                         Now who'da done a mean thing like 
                         that?

                         I'm not quite sure.

                         This ain't my room.

                                     GIDEON
                         Mine, either.

                                     DYLE
                              (considering the 
                              situation)
                         The police aren't going to like this 
                         one bit.

                                     GIDEON
                              (helpful)
                         We could dry him off and take him 
                         down the hall to his own room.
                              (looking at the body)
                         He really doesn't look so bad.

                                     TEX
                         We could put him to bed 'n let one 
                         o' them fem-de-chambers find him in 
                         the mornin'.

               DYLE and GIDEON look at one another.

                         always was strangers. Maybe now he'll 
                         meet up with his other hand someplace -- 
                         but I sure hope it ain't waitin' for 
                         him in Heaven.

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE. The dead man's eyes are open, his jaw 
               hanging, his head lying crazily on the pillow.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him lying in bed, dressed in his 
               pajamas. CAMERA WHIRLS for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of a MAID, her 
               eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes 
               her. Then she screams.

               INT. GRANDPIERRE'S OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. The policeman is apoplectic.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         No! No! No! No!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include, REGGIE, DYLE, TEX and GIDEON, 
               all sitting silently in the INSPECTOR's office.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         A man drowned in his bed -- 
                         impossible! And in his pajamas -- 
                         the second one in his pajamas -- 
                         c'est trop bête! Stop lying to me --
                              (Tapping the side of 
                              his nose)
                         this nose tells me when you are lying --
                         it is never mistaken, not in twenty-
                         three years -- this nose will make 
                         me commissaire of police.
                              (Tapping his fingers

                         Mr. Dyle or Mr. Joshua -- which is 
                         it?

                                     DYLE
                         Dyle.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And yet you registered in Megeve as 
                         Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against 
                         the law to register under an assumed 
                         name?

                                     DYLE
                         No, I didn't.

                         It's done in America all the time.

               GRANDPIERRE raps for silence on his desk. During the pause, 
               he looks into each face in turn.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         None of you will be permitted to 
                         leave Paris -- until this matter is 
                         cleared up. Only I warn you -- I 
                         will be watching. We use the 
                         guillotine in this country -- I have 
                         always suspected that the blade coming 
                         down causes no more than a slight 
                         tickling sensation on the back of 
                         the neck. It is only a guess, of 
                         course -- I hope none of you ever 
                         finds out for certain.

               REGGIE and DYLE walking along the quai, next to the Seine, 
               CAMERA LEADING.

                                     REGGIE
                         Who do you think did it -- Gideon?

                                     DYLE
                         Maybe.

                                     REGGIE
                         Or Tex?

                                     DYLE
                         Maybe.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're a big help. Can I have one of 
                         those?

               They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the 
               Pont au Double. DYLE shrugs.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to the VENDOR)
                         Vanille-chocolat.

               During the following, the VENDOR makes a double-decker cone 
               and hands it to REGGIE. DYLE pays and they resume their walk -- 
               all with no break in the dialogue.

                                     REGGIE
                         I think Tex did it.

                                     DYLE
                         Why?

                                     REGGIE
                         Because I really suspect Gideon -- 
                         and it is always the person you don't 
                         suspect.

                                     DYLE
                         Do women think it's feminine to be 
                         so illogical -- or can't they help 
                         it?

                                     REGGIE
                         What's so illogical about that?

                                     DYLE
                         A) It's always the person you don't 
                         suspect; B) that means you think 
                         it's Tex because you really suspect 
                         Gideon; therefore C) if you think 
                         it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- 
                         Gideon.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. I guess they just can't help it.

                                     DYLE
                         Who?

                                     REGGIE
                         Women. You know, I can't help feeling 
                         rather sorry for Scobie.
                              (a pause)
                         Wouldn't it be nice if we were like 
                         that?

                                     DYLE
                         What -- like Scobie?

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way 
                         he danced down there next to the 
                         river in 'American in Paris' -- 
                         without a care in the world? This is 
                         good, want some?

               She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough 
               force to dislodge the ice-cream. It lands right next to his 
               lapel, over his outside breast pocket.

                                     DYLE
                              (frowning)
                         I'd love some, thanks.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry.

               He pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks 
               inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees. REGGIE 
               still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it.

               Seeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket.

                                     DYLE
                         No sense messing up the streets.

                                     REGGIE
                         Alex --

                                     DYLE
                         Hm?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm scared.

                                     DYLE
                         Don't worry, I'm not going to hit 
                         you.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't 
                         think of any reason why he was killed.

               They resume walking.

                                     DYLE
                         Maybe somebody felt that four shares 
                         were too many --

                                     REGGIE
                         What makes you think that this 
                         somebody will be satisfied with three? 
                         He wants it all, Alex -- that means 
                         we're in his way, too.

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, I know.

                                     REGGIE
                         First your brother, then Charles, 
                         now Scobie -- we've got to do 
                         something! Any minute now we could 
                         be assassinated! Would you do anything 
                         like that?

                                     DYLE
                              (surprised)
                         What? Assassinate somebody?

                                     REGGIE
                         No --

                         to save the woman you love -- like 
                         Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback 
                         of Notre Dame'?

                         Let me know what you want -- I'll 
                         pick a suit that matches.

               He goes into his room and she goes into hers.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               She enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the 
               door connecting her room with DYLE's. She unlocks it, tries 
               to open it, but finds it locked. Disappointed, she knocks.

                                     DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What do you want?

                         It's the house detective -- why 
                         haven't you got a girl in there?

               He calls to her through the closed door as he empties his 
               pockets.

                                     DYLE
                         Lord, you're a pest.

                         Wouldn't it be better if you did it 
                         in my room?

                                     DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What for?

                                     REGGIE
                         I wouldn't want to use that tub. 
                         Besides, I don't want to be alone. 
                         I'm afraid.

                         happens, holler.

               He sits down to take off his shoes, but is interrupted by 
               the sound of REGGIE screaming. He races for the connecting 
               door, pulls back the bolt and rushes in.

                         Reggie!

               He wheels as the door is slammed and REGGIE, who had been 
               standing behind it, locks it and pockets the key.

                                     REGGIE
                         Got you.

                                     DYLE
                         Did you ever hear the story of the 
                         boy who cried wolf?

                                     REGGIE
                         The shower's in there.

               He goes to the door leading to the hall and finds that locked 
               as well. She smiles at him.

                                     DYLE
                              (warning)
                         Reggie -- open the door.

                                     REGGIE
                         This is a ludicrous situation. There 
                         must be dozens of men dying to use 
                         my shower.

                                     DYLE
                         Then I suggest you call one of them.

                                     REGGIE
                         I dare you.

               DYLE looks at her, then sits down and starts to remove his 
               shoes.

                                     REGGIE
                              (has she gone too 
                              far?)
                         What are you doing?

                                     DYLE
                         Have you ever heard of anyone taking 
                         a shower with his shoes on?
                              (to himself)
                         What a nut.

               Shoes off, DYLE starts for the bathroom, humming.

                                     DYLE
                         I usually sing a medley of old 
                         favorites when I bathe -- any 
                         requests?

                         I don't think I know that one.

               Testing the water with his hand, he now steps in fully 
               dressed. REGGIE can't believe her eyes. She goes to the open 
               door for a closer look.

                         Drip-dry!

               He takes the soap and begins washing as if he were washing 
               himself without the suit.

                                     DYLE
                         The suit needs it more than I do, 
                         anyway.

                         little ritual?

               As he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it.

                                     DYLE
                         Every day. The manufacturer recommends 
                         it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't believe it.

               He opens his coat and reads a label inside.

                         "Wearing this suit during washing 
                         will help protect its shape."

               He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail-
               brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band. He holds up his 
               wrist so she can see the watch.

                         You're probably weak from hunger. 
                         You've only had five meals today.

               She turns and looks at him.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you mind if we go someplace 
                         crowded? I -- I feel like lots of 
                         people tonight.

               EXT. SEINE - BÂTEAU MOUCHE -- DUSK

               The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze 
               with lights.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND DYLE (PROCESS)

               At a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in 
               the b.g.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word 
                         in twenty minutes.

                                     REGGIE
                         I keep thinking about Charles and 
                         Scobie -- and the one who's going to 
                         be next -- me?

                                     DYLE
                         Nothing's going to happen to you 
                         while I'm around -- I want you to 
                         believe that.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can I believe it when you don't 
                         even know who the killer is? I've 
                         got that right, haven't I? You don't 
                         know who did it.

                                     DYLE
                         No -- not yet.

                                     REGGIE
                         But then if we sit back and wait, 
                         the field should start narrowing 
                         down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left 
                         alive at the end will pretty well 
                         have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't 
                         you say so?

                                     DYLE
                         Are you trying to say that I might 
                         have killed Charles and Scobie?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     DYLE
                         What do I have to do to satisfy you -- 
                         become the next victim?

                                     REGGIE
                         It's a start, anyway.

                                     DYLE
                         I don't understand you at all -- one 
                         minute you're chasing me around the 
                         shower room and the next you're 
                         accusing me of murder.

                                     REGGIE
                         Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.

               WIDER ANGLE

               She rises from the table and walks away. DYLE hesitates a 
               moment, then follows.

                                     DYLE
                         I can explain if you'll just listen. 
                         Will you listen?

                                     REGGIE
                              (looking at the river)
                         I can't very well leave without a 
                         pair of water wings.

                                     DYLE
                         Okay. Then get set for the story of 
                         my life -- not that it would ever 
                         make the best-seller list.

                                     REGGIE
                         Fiction or non-fiction?

                                     DYLE
                         Why don't you shut up!

                                     REGGIE
                         Well!

                                     DYLE
                         Are you going to listen?

                                     REGGIE
                         Go on.

                                     DYLE
                         After I graduated college I was all 
                         set to go into my father business. 
                         Umbrella frames -- that's what he 
                         made. It was a sensible business, I 
                         suppose, but I didn't have the sense 
                         to be interested in anything sensible.

                                     REGGIE
                         I suppose all this is leading 
                         somewhere?

                                     DYLE
                         It led me away from umbrella frames, 
                         for one thing. But that left me 
                         without any honest means of support.

                                     REGGIE
                         What do you mean?

                                     DYLE
                         When a man has no profession except 
                         the one he loathes, what's left? I 
                         began looking for people with more 
                         money than they'd ever need -- 
                         including some they'd barely miss.

                                     REGGIE
                              (astonished)
                         You mean, you're a thief?

                                     DYLE
                         Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd 
                         have chosen, but I suppose it captures 
                         the spirit of the thing.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't believe it.

                                     DYLE
                         Well, I can't really blame you -- 
                         not now.

                                     REGGIE
                         But I do believe it -- that's what I 
                         don't believe. So it's goodbye 
                         Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter 
                         Joshua.

                                     DYLE
                         Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you 
                         realize you've had three names in 
                         the past two days? I don't even know 
                         who I'm talking to any more.

                                     DYLE
                              (now called ADAM)
                         The man's the same, even if the name 
                         isn't.

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- he's not the same. Alexander 
                         Dyle was interested in clearing up 
                         his brother's death. Adam Canfield 
                         is a crook. And with all the 
                         advantages you've got -- brains, 
                         charm, education, a handsome face --

                                     ADAM
                         Oh, come on!

                                     REGGIE
                         -- there has to be a darn good reason 
                         for living the way you do. I want to 
                         know what it is.

                                     ADAM
                         It's simple. I like what I do -- I 
                         enjoy doing it. There aren't many 
                         men who love their work as much as I 
                         do. Look around some time.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

                                     ADAM
                         Yes, but --

                                     ADAM AND REGGIE
                              (together)
                         -- we're divorced.

                                     ADAM
                         Right. Now go eat your dinner.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               They walk back to the table, where a WAITER is busy putting 
               food on it, mostly on REGGIE's side.

                                     REGGIE
                              (miserably)
                         I could eat a horse.

                                     ADAM
                              (looking at all the 
                              food)
                         I think that's what you ordered.

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't you dare to be civil with me!  
                         All this time you were leading me on --

                                     ADAM
                         How was I leading you on?

                                     REGGIE
                         All that marvelous rejection -- you 
                         knew I couldn't resist it. Now it 
                         turns out you were only interested 
                         in the money.

                                     ADAM
                         That's right.

                                     REGGIE (HURT)
                         Oh!

                                     ADAM
                         What would you like me to say -- 
                         that a pretty girl with an outrageous 
                         manner means more to an old pro like 
                         me than a quarter of a million 
                         dollars?

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- I guess not.

                                     ADAM
                         It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.

                                     REGGIE
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         Don't you know I'm having a tough 
                         time keeping my eyes off of you?

               REGGIE reacts in surprise.

                                     ADAM
                         Oh, you should see your face.

                                     REGGIE
                         What about it?

                                     ADAM
                              (taking her hand, 
                              nicely)
                         It's lovely.

               She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate 
               away.

                                     ADAM
                         What's the matter?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?

               The lights go out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (alarmed)
                         Adam!

                                     ADAM
                         It's all right -- look.

               EXT. SEINE BÂTEAU MOUCHE -- NIGHT

               A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now 
               begins sweeping the river banks. On benches by the water's 
               edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly 
               and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of 
               mutual affection. Some are embarrassed, some are amused and 
               some (the most intimate) damn annoyed. One even shakes his 
               fist at the light.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

               Who, like everyone else, leave the table and stand together 
               at the rail watching.

                                     REGGIE
                         You don't look so bad in this light.

                                     ADAM
                         Why do you think I brought you here?

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating the lovers)
                         I thought maybe you wanted me to see 
                         the kind of work the competition was 
                         turning out.

                                     ADAM
                         Pretty good, huh? I taught them 
                         everything they do.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh? Did they do that sort of thing 
                         way back in your day?

                                     ADAM
                         How do you think I got here?

               She rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction 
               is to look at her.

                                     REGGIE
                         Aren't you allowed to kiss back?

                                     ADAM
                         No. The doctor said it would be bad 
                         for my -- thermostat.

               She kisses him again. He responds a little better.

                                     ADAM
                         When you come on, you really come 
                         on.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- come on.

               She starts to kiss him again, but he stops her.

                                     REGGIE
                         I know why you're not taken -- no 
                         one can catch up with you.

                                     ADAM
                         Relax -- you're gaining.

               DELETED

               INT. GIDEON'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- GIDEON. As he sits bolt upright in bed, startled.

               The room is dark and the phone is ringing. He switches on 
               the lamp, looks at the clock (it reads 3:30) and shakes his 
               head before picking up the receiver.

                                     GIDEON
                         Huh? You must be crazy -- it's three-
                         thirty in the morning -- you mean 
                         now?  -- all right -- I'll be down 
                         in a minute.

               He hangs up, swings his feet out of bed and spears his 
               slippers, reaching for his robe at the same time. Then he 
               shuffles sleepily to the door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

               As GIDEON comes out of his room and goes to the elevator.

               The cage is there. He opens the door and enters.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               GIDEON closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The 
               cage starts down. GIDEON begins sneezing. Suddenly the 
               elevator stops between floors and the lights go out.

                                     GIDEON
                         Hey! Turn on the lights!

               Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts 
               moving down again. GIDEON shakes his head and leans back, 
               whistling again. The cage comes to his floor and starts past 
               it. Seeing this, GIDEON looks confused.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               The NIGHT PORTER is asleep behind the desk. The elevator, 
               GIDEON inside, keeps coming down. It passes the lobby level 
               and keeps right on going, toward the basement.

                                     GIDEON
                         Hey! How do you stop this thing?

               The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is 
               a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes 
               that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely 
               awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking 
               horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He 
               presses the call button and the motor starts.

               An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER 
               opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES 
               PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor 
               of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a 
               puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no 
               strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. He is now doubly apoplectic.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Three of them -- all in their pajamas! 
                         C'est ridicule! What is it, some new 
                         American fad?

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal REGGIE and ADAM, in their 
               bathrobes.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And now your friend -- the one from 
                         Texas -- he has disappeared -- checked 
                         out -- pouf! into thin air! Where is 
                         he?

                                     ADAM
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Madame?

               REGGIE shrugs.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Tell me, Mr. Dyle -- where were you 
                         at three-thirty?

                                     ADAM
                         In my room, asleep.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And you, Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         I was, too.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         In Mr. Dyle's room?

                                     REGGIE
                              (bitterly)
                         No -- in my room.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                              (pause, lighting cigar)
                         It stands to reason you are telling 
                         the truth -- for why would you invent 
                         such a ridiculous story?

               REGGIE and ADAM exchange looks.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And if I were you, I would not stay 
                         in my pajamas. Good night.

               GRANDPIERRE turns and leaves. REGGIE and ADAM start down the 
               hall toward their own rooms.

                                     ADAM
                         That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. 
                         Go back to bed -- I'll let you know 
                         when I've found him.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're going to look for him -- now?

                                     ADAM
                         If the police find him first they're 
                         not very likely to turn over a quarter 
                         of a million dollars to us, are they?

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam --

                                     ADAM
                         There's no time -- I'll call you in 
                         the morning.

               ADAM disappears into his own room.

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters, going to the closet to remove his suit.

               The phone rings. He answers it.

                                     ADAM
                         Yes?

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX. As he speaks on the phone.

                                     TEX
                         Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my 
                         mama didn't raise no stupid children. 
                         I know who's got the money 'n I ain't 
                         disappearing till I got my share -- 
                         'n' my share's growin' a whole lot 
                         bigger ev'ry day.

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     ADAM
                              (on the phone)
                         Where are you, ol' buddy?

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                              (on the phone)
                              (laughs)
                         I'll tell you what, fella -- you 
                         want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round --
                         from now on I'll be right behind 
                         you.
                              (hangs up)

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM, before hanging up, reflects on TEX's words, then looks 
               behind him. Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts 
               for REGGIE's door.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting 
               door.

                                     REGGIE
                         What is it?

                                     ADAM
                         Open up.

               She undoes the bolt and opens the door. ADAM enters.

                                     ADAM
                         I think we were wrong about Tex having 
                         the money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why?

                                     ADAM
                         I just heard from him -- he's still 
                         hungry. That means killing Gideon 
                         didn't get it for him -- so he's 
                         narrowed it down to us. You've got 
                         it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --

                                     ADAM
                         Where's that airlines bag?

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, you're stubborn.

                                     ADAM
                         I sure am. Get it.

               She goes to the closet and gets the bag.

                                     ADAM
                         Charles must have had the money with 
                         him on the train, and Tex missed it.

               He takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents.

                                     REGGIE
                         But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's 
                         been through that bag. Somebody would 
                         have seen it.

                                     ADAM
                         Let's look anyway.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, you're stubborn.

                                     ADAM
                         I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only 
                         we could see it. We're looking at it 
                         right now.

               CLOSE SHOT -- BED WITH CHARLES' BELONGINGS

                                     ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Something on that bed is worth a 
                         quarter of a million dollars.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes, but what?

                                     ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I don't know -- I just don't know.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

               As ADAM begins to examine the items one by one.

                                     ADAM
                         Electric razor -- comb -- steamship 
                         ticket -- fountain pen -- four 
                         passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --
                              (He goes through the 
                              wallet, finds nothing)
                         key -- what about that?

                                     REGGIE
                         To the apartment -- it matches mine 
                         perfectly.

                                     ADAM
                         The letter --

               He takes it out of the envelope and takes out his glasses 
               before reading it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'll bet you don't really need those.

               He hands her the glasses and she looks through them.

                                     REGGIE
                         You need them.
                              (She hands them back)
                          

                                     ADAM
                              (reading the letter)
                         It still doesn't make sense, but it 
                         isn't worth any quarter of a million 
                         either. Have we forgotten anything?

                                     REGGIE
                         The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- 
                         could you recognize heroin just by 
                         tasting it?

               He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it. REGGIE 
               watches expectantly.

                                     ADAM
                         Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.

                                     ADAM
                         Go to bed. You've got to be at work 
                         in the morning. There's nothing more 
                         we can do tonight.

                                     REGGIE
                              (pause)
                         I love you, Adam.

                                     ADAM
                         Yes, you told me.

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- last time I said "I love you, 
                         Alex."

               Ecole Militaire.

               INT. UNESCO CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               SEVERAL DELEGATES identified by little plaques in front of 
               them listing their respective nations, and their AIDES, sit 
               around the large table. They are all wearing earphones.

               The ITALIAN DELEGATE is speaking.

                                     ITALIAN DELEGATE
                         -- di conseguenza, il Governo Italiano 
                         è decisamente a favore per 
                         l'incoraggiamento, in accordo con le 
                         tradizioni etniche rispettive delle 
                         culture basilari dei passi in via di 
                         sviluppo. Per esempio, pregare i 
                         Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro 
                         risaie ed ai loro campi di soja 
                         tradizionali una raccolta di semola, 
                         non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro 
                         secolari tradizioni ma, oltre tutto, 
                         e questo è molto importante per il 
                         Governo che io ho l'onore di 
                         rappresentare disturberebbe 
                         l'esportazione delle derrate farinose 
                         italiane in questa parte del mondo. 
                         Signori Delegati vi ringrazio della 
                         vostra attenzione.

               INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY

               REGGIE, wearing her headset, is talking with SYLVIE.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope Jean-Louis understands about 
                         last night -- it's just not safe for 
                         him to be around me right now.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Don't be silly -- he would not do 
                         anything. He is not yet old enough 
                         to be interested in girls. He says 
                         collecting stamps is much more 
                         satisfying to a man of his age.

                                     REGGIE
                         Hold it -- Italy just finished. 
                         They're recognizing Great Britain.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Oh la vache!

               SYLVIE jumps up and rushes next door into her booth, shutting 
               the door after her.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               The BRITISH DELEGATE rises to speak, continuing through the 
               next scene.

                                     BRITISH DELEGATE
                         Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my 
                         distinguished colleague from Italy. 
                         Her Majesty's delegation has listened 
                         with great patience to the Southern 
                         European position on this problem, 
                         and while we find it charmingly 
                         stated, we cannot possibly agree 
                         with its content. In 1937, in the 
                         British colonies of Kenya, Uganda 
                         and Tanganyika -- and, if I'm not 
                         mistaken, more or less in Somaliland -- 
                         a programme of crop rotation was 
                         instituted vis-à-vis arable land 
                         which had never before known the 
                         plough, beginning before the soil 
                         was able to know the sort of fatigue 
                         now plaguing most of Western Europe. 
                         In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's 
                         Government -- at that time His 
                         Majesty's Government -- was able to 
                         properly assay the situation. We 
                         therefore oppose the resolution.

               INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY

               The door from the hall opens and ADAM enters.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- I think I've found --
                              (stopping)
                         are you on?

                                     REGGIE
                         No, it's all right. What's wrong, 
                         Adam?

                                     ADAM
                         Nothing's wrong. I think I found 
                         something. I was snooping around 
                         Tex's room and I found this in the 
                         waste basket. I've stuck it back 
                         together.

               He hands her a paper.

               INSERT -- POLICE RECEIPT

               The one GRANDPIERRE gave REGGIE. It has been torn in half 
               and scotch-taped back together.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's the receipt Inspector Grandpierre 
                         gave me -- for Charles's things. I 
                         don't see how that's going to --

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

                                     ADAM
                         You didn't look. Last night, when we 
                         went through the airlines bag, 
                         something was missing. See -- ?
                              (showing her the list)
                         "One agenda." It wasn't there.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're right. I remember Grandpierre 
                         looking through it. But there was 
                         nothing in it -- at least, nothing 
                         that the police thought was very 
                         important.

                                     ADAM
                         Can you remember anything at all?

                                     REGGIE
                         Grandpierre asked me about an 
                         appointment Charles had -- on the 
                         day he was killed.

                                     ADAM
                         With whom? Where?

                                     REGGIE
                         I think it only said where -- but I 
                         can't --

                                     ADAM
                         Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- 
                         it may be what we're looking for.

                                     REGGIE
                         That money's not ours, Adam -- if we 
                         keep it, we'll be breaking the law.

                                     ADAM
                         Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's 
                         no law against stealing stolen money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Of course there is!

                                     ADAM
                         There is? Well, I can't say I think 
                         very much of a silly law like that. 
                         Think, Reggie -- please think -- 
                         what was written in Charles' notebook?

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- it was a place -- a street 
                         corner, I think. But I don't --
                              (hearing something 
                              through her earpiece)
                         Hold it. I'm on.

               She turns back to the conference, flips a switch and starts 
               speaking into her headset.

                         vu par mon Gouvernement n'est pas 
                         aussi simple que nos amis les Anglais 
                         voudraient nous le faire croire.

                         But Charles' appointment was last 
                         week, not --

                                     ADAM
                         I know, but this is all we've got 
                         left.

                         Well, you're right there. Ten minutes 
                         ago I had a job.

                         Stop grousing. If we find the money 
                         I'll buy you an international 
                         conference all your own. Now start 
                         looking. You take this side and I'll 
                         poke around over there.

                         It's hopeless -- I don't even know 
                         what we're looking for.

                                     ADAM
                         It's all right -- I don't think Tex 
                         does, either.

               He stands near the merry-go-round, looking at something in

                         I'd better see what he's up to.  
                         Stay here -- I won't be long.

               ADAM starts off.

                              (concerned)
                         Be careful, Adam -- please. He's

               Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden 
               booths have been set up. They have collected quite a CROWD. 
               Into this area comes TEX, followed at a safe distance by

               Various FLASH SHOTS of stamps of all sizes, shapes and colors.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               As he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into 
               ADAM. TEX is startled.

                         Sorry, fella --

               He rushes off past ADAM, who watches him for a moment, 
               confused, then turns toward the booth, not yet having seen 
               the stamps.

               on the floor.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including ADAM as he enters, his gun trained on TEX. Without 
               speaking he goes to the airlines bag, then stoops down to go 
               through the spilled contents, keeping one eye all the time 
               on TEX. But he can't find what he's looking for.

                         stamps you gave him this morning. He 
                         said he had never seen any like them.

               studying something on the table. There is a KNOCK. He looks 
               up. Another KNOCK.

               The door opens and REGGIE, followed by SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, 
               enters.

                         too, of course.

                              (looking at SYLVIE)
                         Yes.

                         was American. I did not see him but 
                         I heard. I knew you would come.

               He gestures for REGGIE to come closer. Together with SYLVIE 
               and JEAN-LOUIS, she goes to the table and looks at the stamps.

               Four of them -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still 
               attached to the portion of the torn envelope.

                         the owner of one was murdered by a

               As REGGIE comes hurrying up the stairs. She goes first to 
               ADAM's room and knocks.

                         Adam? Adam? It's me, Reggie -- !

               There is no answer. She goes to her own door and, to her 
               surprise, finds it an inch or two ajar.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE enters. She freezes, having seen something on the 
               floor.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               His dead body lies on the floor, the wrists of his extended 
               arms tied to the leg of the bed, his ankles to the steam 
               radiator. And tied around his head is a plastic, transparent 
               bag, inside of which the suffocated man's face, the eyes 
               bulging against the plastic clinging tight to his features, 
               can be seen all too clearly. REGGIE enters the shot, bending 
               down to see if he's alive. Then she sees something beside 
               his hands near the leg of the bed.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARPET

               With his dying effort, TEX has traced a name against the 
               grain of the maroon carpet -- 'DYLE.'

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE leaves her room and goes to the elevator. She 
               presses the button, then notices it is in use. She goes to 
               the stairs and starts down.

               Between the landings. The stairs curve around the open 
               elevator shaft. As REGGIE comes down the stairs, the cage 
               rises into view. Inside is ADAM. For a moment, she stops and 
               their eyes meet.

                         Where are you going? Wait!

               ADAM pushes the emergency stop button and then starts the

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- SECOND LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate and 
               starts down toward the lobby, the cage a few feet behind 
               her.

                         dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle 
                         did it!

                                     ADAM
                         I'm not Dyle -- you know that!

                                     REGGIE
                         But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- 
                         !

                                     ADAM
                         Don't be an idiot!

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE reaches the lobby first and, without hesitation, races 
               toward the front door and out. The confused hotel MANAGER 
               behind the desk can only stare in surprise. The elevator, 
               ADAM inside, has not yet reached the bottom.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- ! I want those stamps!

               EXT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               A taxi stands by the curb. REGGIE leaves the hotel and runs 
               to it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating the 
                              direction)
                         Palais Royal -- vite!

               Calmly, the DRIVER points to the little printed sign on his 
               windshield reading "ITALIE."

                                     DRIVER
                              (pointing the other 
                              way)
                         Porte d'Italie, moi.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mais c'est très vite! On veut me 
                         teur!

                                     DRIVER
                              (shaking his head)
                         Italie.

               She looks around and sees ADAM come out of the hotel and 
               straight toward her. She turns and runs off toward the Place 
               St. Michel.

               EXT. PLACE ST. MICHEL -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes to the corner. She stops, sees the Métro 
               station ("St. Michel") and rushes to it, scampering down the 
               stairs. ADAM is behind her.

               INT. ST. MICHEL MÉTRO STATION -- NIGHT

               REGGIE comes flying down the stairs and runs past the ticket 
               booth, fishing in her bag for her carnet (booklet of tickets), 
               casting a quick look behind her. CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO ADAM 
               just coming off the stairs, who runs after her.

               DELETED

               INT. MÉTRO TICKET GATE -- NIGHT

               REGGIE gets to the gate ahead of ADAM and manages to crowd 
               in front of some OTHERS about to pass through. Barely 
               stopping, she holds out her ticket to the GUARD to be punched, 
               then heads down the platform, still running. ADAM gets to 
               the gate but the GUARD stops him as he tries to pass through.

                                     GUARD
                         Billet, Monsieur.

                                     ADAM
                              (breathless)
                         I don't want to go anywhere -- I'm 
                         only trying --

                                     GUARD
                              (pointing off)
                         Billet, Monsieur.

               ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up 
               and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               CAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly 
               empty. Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PASSAGEWAY WALL (TRAVELING)

               The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, 
               forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating 
               two different directions, an arrow for each.

               "DIRECTION: Pte D'ORLÉANS Pte DE CLIGNANCOURT-------"

               Choosing "Clignancourt," she runs off. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY, 
               180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot 
               pursuit.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every 
               few steps.  Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across 
               the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.  He has evidently 
               made the wrong turn back in the passageway.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  Then the bell rings, 
               announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back 
               through the exit behind him. Not knowing what to do, REGGIE 
               looks into the darkness of the tunnel. The approaching train 
               can be heard.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to herself)
                         Come on -- please --

               She turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door 
               starts to close. As it does, the train roars into the station.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               The gate can be seen slowly closing. ADAM runs to it, tries 
               to force it back but cannot. Finally, he jumps up and, 
               commando style, vaults over it.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE is just entering the red center car (the two on either 
               side are dark green). ADAM runs for the red car and just 
               manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches 
               falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing 
               to inform the motor-man to depart. The train starts to move.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               The entire length of the car separates ADAM and REGGIE.

               For a moment, their eyes meet, then ADAM starts to weave his 
               way past the other PASSENGERS, on his way to her.

               Suddenly, he is stopped. ADAM turns to see a TRAIN GUARD.

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                         Billet, Monsieur.

               ADAM shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but 
               again the TRAIN GUARD stops him.

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                         Vous êtes dans le premier classe, 
                         Monsieur.

                                     ADAM
                         What?

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                              (heavy accent)
                         This car is for first class only -- 
                         you have a second-class ticket.

                                     ADAM
                         But that's what they gave me.

               He tries to pull away from the TRAIN GUARD and finds himself 
               staring into the serious face of a GENDARME.

                                     GENDARME
                         Monsieur -- ?

               ADAM looks at the GENDARME, then at REGGIE.

               INT. "PALAIS-ROYAL" MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               As the TRAIN pulls in and comes to a stop.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               The GENDARME opens the door for ADAM and escorts him out.

               ADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes. She remains 
               in the car.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               The GENDARME gestures for ADAM to enter the green, second- 
               class car behind the red, first-class one. Reluctantly, ADAM 
               does.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters and goes to the door through which he can see 
               REGGIE in the car ahead. She is gone. Moving quickly, he 
               returns to the exit door and looks at the platform.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               From ADAM'S P.O.V. She is hurrying toward an exit marked 
               "SORTIE."

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring ADAM as he hurries from the car. He finds his way 
               blocked by FIVE NUNS in large, white butterfly hats.

               It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around 
               them.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               REGGIE has entered an area leading to the exit. But as she 
               reaches the stairway leading up to the street level, she is 
               confronted with an iron grill barring her way. She tries to 
               open it, but it is firmly padlocked. A sign hung on it reads 
               "FERMÉ LES WEEKENDS." She turns, desperately looking for 
               some way out.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is off the train. He stands on the platform as the train 
               doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and 
               the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions, 
               looking for some sign of REGGIE. He spots the exit marked 
               "SORTIE" (the same one used by REGGIE) and starts toward it.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters the deserted area. There is, miraculously, no 
               sign of REGGIE. He goes to the locked grill and tries it, 
               testing the padlock. CAMERA PANS to a phone booth (solid 
               door with a window in the upper half) and we see REGGIE's 
               hand reaching up to dial a number.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE sits on the floor of the booth, dialing.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to herself, as she 
                              dials)
                         Balzac 3 - 0 - 0 - 4.

               She holds the receiver to her ear. The number can be heard 
               ringing but no one answers. She hangs up and reaches for the 
               phone book, leafing through its pages.

                                     REGGIE

               ADAM stands for a minute, looking around, not knowing what 
               to do.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE has finished dialing her number and now pushes the 
               button. It clicks loudly.

               As she runs, ADAM several yards behind her.

                                     ADAM
                              (in b.g., calling)
                         Reggie -- wait!

               She turns into the exit.

               INT. MÉTRO STAIRWAY -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE starts up the long, steep flight of stone steps 
               leading to the street level. ADAM appears behind her, climbing 
               two at a time and gaining.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- why won't you listen?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm through listening to you!

               He is rapidly closing the gap between them. It is clear that 
               REGGIE is tiring.

                                     ADAM
                         But I didn't kill anybody.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then who did? You're the only one 
                         left.

               PASSERSBY, descending the stairs, stand aside to let the two 
               strange Americans pass, watching in wonderment. ADAM is only 
               a few steps behind now.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- please believe me!

                                     REGGIE
                         No!

               As REGGIE wearily gains the top, ADAM lunges for her. He 
               manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he 
               winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand.

               REGGIE shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running, 
               limping in her one shoe. ADAM scrambles to his feet and starts 
               after her again.

               INT. MÉTRO TICKET BOOTH AREA -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE, still hobbling, runs through and toward the stairs, 
               leading to the street. CAMERA PANS TO ADAM, as he, too, runs 
               through. He is again several yards behind her.

               EXT. PLACE PALAIS ROYAL -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes up the stairs from the Métro. She stops long 
               enough to kick off her other shoe, then runs across the 
               street, ignoring the traffic, toward the Rue de Valois (which 
               forms one side of the Palais Royal). ADAM is gaining on her 
               again.

               EXT. PALAIS ROYAL COURTYARD -- COLONNADE -- NIGHT

               The smaller court at the Comédie-Française end of the Palais 
               gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double 
               peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from 
               each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each -- 
               in all, eighty columns. The only person in sight is the man 
               we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the 
               columns, looking at his watch impatiently.

               Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs 
               into the court. She spots "BARTHOLOMEW" and fishes in her 
               bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving 
               them.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me!

               ADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the 
               near end of the colonnade as he spots "BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE, 
               still running, is halfway between the two men. "BARTHOLOMEW" 
               draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked 
               in among the columns.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- stop! That's Carson Dyle!

               This news hits REGGIE hard and she stops, in alarm.

                                     REGGIE
                              (breathless)
                         Carson -- ?

               She looks at "BARTHOLOMEW," then back at ADAM, who has drawn 
               his own gun.

               (NOTE: Both "BARTHOLOMEW" and ADAM are in among the stone 
               columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of 
               each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps 
               in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to).

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                              (calmly)
                         We all know Carson Dyle is dead, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

                                     ADAM
                         It's Carson Dyle, I tell you!

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         You're not going to believe him, 
                         Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic. 
                         He's trying to trick you again.

               REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.

                                     ADAM
                         Tex recognized him -- that's why he 
                         said Dyle. If you give him those 
                         stamps, he'll kill you too!

               REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         Mrs. Lampert -- if I'm who he said, 
                         what's preventing me from killing 
                         you right now?

               REGGIE stops, turns back to "BARTHOLOMEW."

                                     ADAM
                         Because he'd have to come out to get 
                         the stamps -- he knows he'd never 
                         make it.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         What's the matter with you, Mrs. 
                         Lampert? Are you going to believe 
                         every lie he tells you? He wants the 
                         money for himself -- that's all he's 
                         ever wanted.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to ADAM, explaining)
                         He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen 
                         him at the Embassy.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         That's right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm a 
                         dead man -- look at me.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know who anybody is any more!

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- listen to me!

                                     REGGIE
                         You lied to me so many times --

                                     ADAM
                              (gently)
                         Reggie -- trust me once more -- 
                         please.

                                     REGGIE
                         Can I really believe you this time, 
                         Adam?

                                     ADAM
                              (a pause)
                         There's not a reason on earth why 
                         you should.

               She looks toward ADAM for a moment, then back to 
               "BARTHOLOMEW", then slowly starts toward ADAM.

                                     REGGIE
                         All right, Adam.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or 
                         I'll kill you.

               REGGIE stops in alarm.

                                     ADAM
                         It won't get you the stamps, Dyle -- 
                         You'll have to come out to get them, 
                         and I'm not likely to miss at this 
                         range.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                              (now called CARSON)
                         Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of 
                         bullets to kill me. They left me 
                         there with five of them in my legs 
                         and my stomach -- they knew I was 
                         still alive but they left me. I spent 
                         ten months in a German camp -- with 
                         nothing to stop the pain and no food -- 
                         they were willing to take all these 
                         chances for the money, but not for 
                         me. They deserved to die!

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               During the following, he looks around, looking for some way 
               out.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         But I didn't have anything to do 
                         with --

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         You've got the money. It belongs to 
                         me now! Please believe me, Mrs. 
                         Lampert -- I'll kill you -- a little 
                         more blood won't matter.

               During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, 
               creeping cautiously across the open space between the two 
               colonnades and finally, behind the second.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         I'll give you five to make up your 
                         mind, Mrs. Lampert.

               She has seen ADAM's move from her angle, but doesn't know 
               quite what to do.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wait, please! I need some time to 
                         think!

                                     CARSON
                         One --

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his 
               gun ready, trying to get an angle on CARSON.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         -- two --

               Suddenly ADAM stops -- he has caught sight of CARSON through 
               the columns. But he will have a difficult shot.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         -- three --

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         -- four --

               CAMERA PANS DOWN to his gun. As his finger tightens on the 
               trigger and the hammer moves slowly back.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam -- please!

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he aims carefully and fires.

               CLOSE SHOT -- COLUMN

               As the bullet creases it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

               As the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving 
               him unharmed. He wheels.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               With CARSON in the b.g., who fires at him. ADAM ducks behind 
               the column as the bullet hits it and screams off.

               Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Seeing CARSON otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward 
               the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her.

               (Beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming 
               schedule of presentations.)

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door, 
               turns and fires at her. But he is too late -- she is safely 
               inside. CARSON looks quickly back toward ADAM, then takes 
               off after REGGIE.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               Over his shoulder we see a broken picture of CARSON running 
               toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns.  
               ADAM tries to get a shot at him, but can't.

               Finally he runs after him.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON enters and slams the door behind him, locking it.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE DOOR -- NIGHT

               ADAM arriving at the door, bangs on it, then looks around, 
               frustrated. Several yards away he sees a short stairway 
               leading down to a door below the street level. He runs to 
               it, tries the door and enters.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- ORCHESTRA -- NIGHT

               As CARSON enters the auditorium and looks around.

               CARSON'S P.O.V.

               As the CAMERA SWEEPS the magnificent old theatre -- boxes, 
               seats, stage, but there is no sign of REGGIE.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As CARSON walks up the aisle checking between the rows of 
               seats.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               A large room, lit by a single bare bulb, under the stage.

               ADAM appears, moving cautiously, gun ready. He creeps along 
               next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic 
               pieces which fill the room.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the 
               footlights, looking for REGGIE. At mid-stage, CAMERA PANS 
               DOWN to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box.  
               Inside, huddling down, is a terrified REGGIE, holding her 
               breath as she watches him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As CARSON moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board 
               and throws on all the switches. The stage is bathed in light.

               He returns to the stage.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage 
               over his head -- and hearing them now. He looks around and 
               sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up. He goes to it, 
               and, starting up, finds a door. He tries the knob -- the 
               door is locked.

               INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT

               REGGIE, cringing back from the bright light, notices the 
               doorknob turning. It makes a slight clicking sound.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery, 
               hears the doorknob and turns suddenly.

               CARSON'S P.O.V.

               We catch a quick glimpse of REGGIE as she ducks down out of 
               sight.  Too late.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         All right, Mrs. Lampert. The game's 
                         over. Come out of there.

               WIDER ANGLE

               REGGIE does not appear.

                                     CARSON
                         I don't want to kill you, Mrs. Lampert --
                         but I will --

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM comes down the stairs from the prompter's box and looks 
               up at the ceiling.

               MED. SHOT -- CEILING

               It is divided into thirty-six square sections, each numbered 
               and lettered -- from 1A to 6F. They are trapdoors.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               He looks from the ceiling to a row of levers on one wall.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEVERS

               Thirty-six of them, numbered and lettered to correspond to 
               the traps.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON takes a few steps towards the prompter's box, his 
               gun ready.

                                     CARSON
                         Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert -- ?

               INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT

               REGGIE huddled inside.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is listening carefully, trying to figure out where CARSON 
               is standing, watching the ceiling.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP

               It is marked C-4.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I won't wait much longer, Mrs. Lampert

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked C-
               4. He is about to pull it.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON takes a few more steps forward.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He 
               lets his held breath escape. He looks back at the ceiling.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP

               The one marked C-4. As CARSON's voice is heard, CAMERA MOVES 
               to the next trap, marked D-4.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert --

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               He looks at the lever marked D-4. He is perspiring heavily.

               Now he slowly reaches for the lever.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when 
               suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through 
               out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PROMPTER'S BOX

               As REGGIE slowly peers out.

               REGGIE'S P.O.V.

               The empty stage, without being able to see the open trap 
               from this low angle.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap 
               now, runs to it, looking down through it.

               MED. SHOT -- OPEN TRAP

               FROM ABOVE, over REGGIE's head. She can see CARSON sprawled 
               on the floor below, face down and dead. ADAM stands beside 
               the body, looking up at REGGIE and smiling.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As GRANDPIERRE and his TWO ASSISTANTS, guns drawn, walk onto 
               the stage from the wings. They go to the open trap and look 
               down at ADAM.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Mr. Dyle -- you are under arrest for 
                         the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman 
                         Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold 
                         Gideon, and whoever that is down 
                         there.

               ADAM is surprised, then shakes his head.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- you'd better tell him. He 
                         wouldn't dare hit a girl.

               EXT. RUE DE RIVOLI -- NIGHT

               As a TAXI rolls by the arcades, CAMERA PANNING with it.

               INT. TAXI -- NIGHT (PROCESS)

               REGGIE and ADAM in the rear of the cab. REGGIE has one of 
               her feet in her hand, shoe off, rubbing it.

                                     REGGIE
                         You didn't have to chase me so hard --

                                     ADAM
                         Here, give it to me.

               He starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers 
               him the other one.

                                     REGGIE
                         That one's done -- start on this 
                         one.

               He takes the foot and begins rubbing it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry I thought you were the 
                         murderer, Adam -- how did I know 
                         that he was as big a liar as you 
                         are?

                                     ADAM
                         And that's all the gratitude I get 
                         for saving your hide.

                                     REGGIE
                         The truth, now -- was it my hide -- 
                         or the stamps?

                                     ADAM
                         What a terrible thing to say. How 
                         could you even think that?

                                     REGGIE
                         All right, prove it to me -- tell me 
                         to go to the Embassy first thing in 
                         the morning and turn in those stamps.

               ADAM says nothing.

                                     REGGIE
                         I said, tell me to go to the --

                                     ADAM
                         I heard you, I heard you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then say it.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- listen to me --

                                     REGGIE
                         Never mind -- I'll go by myself.

                                     ADAM
                         What makes you think they're even 
                         interested? It's only a quarter of a 
                         million -- it'll cost more than that 
                         to fix up their bookkeeping. As a 
                         taxpayer --

               EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY -- MAIN ENTRANCE -- DAY

               As REGGIE and ADAM approach the MARINE in full-dress uniform 
               always on guard at the Embassy.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to ADAM)
                         Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay
                         taxes.  Excuse me, soldier --

                                     MARINE
                         Marine, ma'am.

                                     REGGIE
                         Forgive me. Whom would I see regarding 
                         the return of stolen Government money?

                                     MARINE
                         You might try the Treasury Department, 
                         ma'am -- Room 216, second floor, Mr. 
                         Cruikshank.

                                     REGGIE
                         Cruikshank, 216. Thank you, Marine.

               INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY

               Featuring a door marked "216." REGGIE and ADAM appear.

                                     ADAM
                         Do you mind if I wait out here? The 
                         sight of all that money being given 
                         away might make me break out.

               INT. EMBASSY TREASURY OFFICE -- DAY

               A SECRETARY sits behind a desk. She looks up as REGGIE enters.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Cruikshank, please -- my name is 
                         Lampert.

               The SECRETARY picks up her phone and presses a button.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss --

                                     REGGIE
                         Mrs.

                                     SECRETARY
                         -- a Mrs. Lampert to see you -- yes 
                         sir.
                              (to REGGIE)
                         Go right in.

               REGGIE goes to the door leading to the private office.

               INT. CRUIKSHANK'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Featuring the door as REGGIE enters. She stops suddenly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring the desk. Behind it sits ADAM (now CRUIKSHANK).

               REGGIE stares at him, unbelievingly, then looks around, 
               confused. By way of explanation he indicates the door to the 
               hall.

                                     REGGIE
                              (blowing up)
                         Well, of all the mean, rotten, 
                         contemptible, crooked --

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Crooked? I should think you'd be 
                         glad to find out I wasn't crooked.

                                     REGGIE
                         You couldn't even be honest about 
                         being dishonest. Why didn't you say 
                         something?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         We're not allowed to tell. May I 
                         have the stamps, please?

                                     REGGIE
                              (reaching into her 
                              bag)
                         Here --
                              (hesitating)
                         Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle 
                         get an office in here, anyway?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         When did you see him -- what time, I 
                         mean?

                                     REGGIE
                         Around one.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         The lunch hour. He probably worked 
                         it out in advance. He found an office 
                         that was usually left open and just 
                         moved in for the time you were here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then how do I know this is your 
                         office?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                              (picking up the phone)
                         Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to 
                         Bartholomew at Security recommending 
                         that --

                                     REGGIE
                         Bartholomew?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         -- recommending that all Embassy 
                         offices be locked during the lunch 
                         hour.

                                     REGGIE
                         Starting with his own.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                              (hanging up)
                         Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.

                                     REGGIE
                         What's your first name today?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Brian.

                                     REGGIE
                         Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve 
                         me right if I got stuck with that 
                         one.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Who asked you to get stuck with any 
                         of them?

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Yes.

                                     REGGIE
                         But you're -- divorced?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         No.

                                     REGGIE
                              (crestfallen)
                         Oh.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         My mother -- she lives in Detroit. 
                         Come on now -- give me those stamps.

                                     REGGIE
                         Only if you can prove to me that 
                         you're really Brian Cruikshank.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         How about if next week some time I 
                         put it on a marriage license -- that 
                         ought to --

                                     REGGIE
                         Quit stalling -- I want to see some 
                         identification -- now!

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- 
                         I could go to jail.

                                     REGGIE
                         You'd lie about anything.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Well, maybe we'd better forget about 
                         it, then.

                                     REGGIE
                         You can't prove it, can you? You're 
                         still trying to --
                              (the coin drops into 
                              the slot)
                         marriage license! Did you say -- ?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         I didn't say anything. Will you give 
                         me those stamps?

                                     REGGIE
                         You did too say it -- I heard you.  
                         Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- 
                         er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have 
                         lots of boys -- we can name them all 
                         after you.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Before we start on that, do you mind 
                         handing over the stamps?

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               BONUS ITEM -- Lyrics to the theme song of the film:

                

                                         CHARADE

                      Music by Henry Mancini, Words by Johnny Mercer

               When we played our Charade we were like children posing, 
               Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we 
               played.

               Oh, what a hit we made. We came on next to closing Best on 
               the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade.

               Fate seemed to pull the strings, I turned and you were gone.

               While from the darkened wings the music box played on.

               Sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing, I hear it 
               still, I always will, best on the bill Charade.
CHERRY FALLS
                   SCREENPLAY BY KEN SELDEN
                         FIRST DRAFT





FEBRUARY 14, 1998

FADE IN:

EXT.  TOWN - NIGHT

The hanging sign says 'Entering Cherry Falls, Ohio'

We see Cherry Falls - A small town in rural Northeastern Ohio. This is 
Norman Rockwell land, red barns on dirt roads, a square in the center of 
town. But things are hidden here. The barns are locked, the shades are 
drawn.

Dissolve to:

EXT.  LOVER'S LANE 

A romantic turn-off used exclusively for parking. A river gushes by. 
Crickets chirp. The trees blow in the autumn wind. A single car sits on 
the lonely road. The muffled sound of a young couple making out drifts 
through the streamed up windows.

INT.  CAR

A teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her 
breast. He pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her 
bare knee.

As he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently 
pulls it away. She places it back on her breast, sliding it under her 
shirt.

We pull back. STACY and ROD, two healthy sixteen year olds, are 
passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big American car.

Rod smiles seductively, kisses Stacy, and places his hand back on her 
knee. Once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand 
tightly.

                   STACY
               No.

He doesn't give up easy. He playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it 
under her skirt. She grabs his hand again.

                   STACY
               I said no.

                   ROD
               But you don't really
               mean it.

He struggles to free his hand.

                   STACY
               Yes I do. Keep it in your
               pants Rod.

He gives up, aggravated.

                   ROD
               Maybe it won't stay in.
               
                   STACY
               Maybe you better just
               drive me home.

He starts the car, glares at her for a second, then turns it off.

                   ROD
               Let me just ask you a serious
               question first.

                   STACY
               What?

                   ROD
               Aren't you worried you
               could die a virgin?

                   STACY
                 (sarcastically)
                Yeah. I'm extremely worried
               about that. It's right up
               there with global warming.

                   ROD
               On our way home, a drunken
               driver could hit us head on
               and send us flying through
               the windshield. Terminate
               us instantly. We'd never 
               experience what it means to
               make love.

                  STACY
               If sheep don't count.

                  ROD
               That wasn't me ...

                  STACY
               I know. I'm kidding you.
               Chill out.

                  ROD
               Well I'm trying to be real
               here and you're mocking me.

                  STACY
               (softening)
              I'm sorry, but you're not
              going to die a virgin Rod.

EXT.  LOVER'S LANE

There is another car around the bend, hidden from sight. It's an old beat 
up Imperial from the late sixties. Someone is watching them. It's probably 
a psychopath.

INT.  ROD'S CAR

Rod leans in and starts kissing Stacy again.

                   ROD(cont.)
               I don't wanna take that chance.
               I want my first time to be with you.

She kisses him back. He slides his hand under her skirt again.

                   STACY
               Stop it.

He doesn't.
                   STACY
               Rod!

                   ROD
                (exasperated)
               You're being unfair.

                   STACY
               Unfair?!

                   ROD
               Yes. Unfair to me.

He begins to overpower her. This is quickly turning into date rape. SHE 
STARTS TO FIGHT BACK BUT HE DOESN'T STOP. FINALLY, SHE SCRATCHES him 
savagely across the face. This catches his attention. He jumps back, cut 
slightly, surprised.

She opens the car door and quickly escapes.

EXT.  ROAD

She runs away from the car, down the road, very upset.

INT.  CAR

Rod catches himself. He looks at his bloodied face in the rear view mirror 
and realizes what he's done.

He starts up the car.

EXT.  ROAD

Stacy runs down the road alone, still very upset.

INT.  CAR

Rod pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.

                  ROD
              Stacy! I'm sorry.

EXT.  ROAD

She pays no attention to him.

                  ROD
              Please get back in the car, Stacy.

She turns and heads down a path into the dark woods, purposely going where 
he can't follow.

INT.  CAR

Rod, frustrated, hits the steering wheel and floors it.

EXT.  ROAD

As Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at 
lover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off.

EXT. WOODS

Stacy heads deeper into the woods. When she finally stops to catch her 
breath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her. 
Suddenly, the footsteps stop. Stacy senses that someone is watching her.

                  STACY
                Rod?

No answer.

                 STACY
               Is that you Rod?

Still no answer. A little frightened, she starts to walk again.  Again she 
hears the footsteps following her. She stops again. Whoever is out there 
stops too. She looks around in every direction.

                 STACY
               Come out Rod.
               This SCREAM bull shit ain't
               gonna work with me!

No answer. Even the birds have stopped chirping.

                 STACY
                (terrified)
              Rod? You're freaking me
              out. Game's over. I lose.
              Come out and we'll fuck.

She hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the 
silhouette of someone standing a few feet away.

The wind picks up. Stacy realizes it isn't Rod. All she can see is that 
whoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very 
long, jagged, steel nail in the other.

                  STACY
               (in full panic)
              NO!

Stacy starts to run. The killer starts after her.

EXT.  STACY'S

Rod is sitting in his car in front of Stacy's house at the edge of the 
woods, waiting for her to appear. He checks his watch.

EXT.  WOODS

Stacy runs for the edge of the woods but she isn't quite fast enough to 
elude her pursuer.

                  STACY
              Help!

The killer catches Stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against 
a tree, cracking a branch. Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.

INT.  CAR

Rod sits up in his seat, thinking he's heard something

EXT.  WOODS

Stacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into 
the woods.

EXT.  STACY'S

Rod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark 
woods.

EXT.  WOODS

Rod's POV - The woods are pitch black.

                   ROD
              Stacy?

                  STACY(O.C.)
            (struggling, in the distance)
            ROD!

EXT.  WOODS

The killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her 
and ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the 
killer.

INT.  CAR

Rod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment.

EXT.  WOODS

Rod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods.

Rod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy.

EXT.  WOODS

Stacy's right hand is raised above her head and placed, palm out, against 
a tree trunk.

EXT.  WOODS

Rod searches for Stacy, his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness.

EXT.  WOODS

The huge nail, extremely sharp and jagged, is placed in the center of 
Stacy's outstretched palm.

The hammer is pulled back, aimed at the head of the nail.

EXT. WOODS

Rod stops and frantically looks around, knowing he's fighting a losing 
battle.

                  ROD
             Stacy?!

EXT.  WOODS

The hammer descends on the nail.

Stacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to 
the tree.

EXT.  WOODS

Rod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound.

Stacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree.

Another nail is readied.

Stacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock.

Rod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample 
fallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her.

Stacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each 
tree. She almost looks crucified.

Rod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's 
terrified eyes. She's looking behind him.

Rod quickly turns around but he's too late.

A knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest.

Stacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping 
her palms on the nails.

Rod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth.

Stacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified.

The killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach.

Stacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned.

A small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is 
placed up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like 
it's an ordinary pencil.

Stacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never 
experienced such pain.

Blood drips to the ground.

Dissolve to:

EXT.  NIGHT SKY

The full moon looks down on the town.

EXT.  CUL DE SAC

Another romantic turn off. A view from the top of a hill overlooking the 
sleepy town. A lonely car sits there, the sound of a teenage couple making 
out drifting through it's steamed up windows. It's almost a repeat of the 
first scene.

INT.  CAR

The boy pulls his hand from under the girl's shirt and unsnaps her jeans. 
She pushes his hand away but he puts it right back, wriggling a finger 
down into her pants.

JODY MARKEN, a pretty all-American sixteen year old girl, strong willed 
but still innocent, stops kissing her boyfriend KENNY, trying to hold him 
off. Kenny is also sixteen. He's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute 
nonetheless. His hair is shoulder length, his stare intense. He takes 
himself seriously, all rebel.

                  JODY
              Cut it out.

                  KENNY
              Why?

                  JODY
              I was supposed to be home
              fifteen minutes ago.

                  KENNY
              So? You're already late.
              A few more minutes won't
              matter.

He slides a second finger into her pants. She closes her legs, making his 
probing much more difficult.

                  JODY
              I got to get home.

                  KENNY
              Fuck your curfew. Most
              sixth graders can stay out
              later than you.

He starts kissing her again.

                  JODY
              Kenny....

She pulls his hand out of her pants. He stares at her for a second, 
completely exasperated. He sits up and starts the car.

EXT.   CUL DE SAC

The car squeals away.

INT.   CAR

Jody and Kenny drive home, not talking.

He pulls up in front of her house.

                  KENNY          
            You know, maybe we ought to
            start seeing other people.

                  JODY
            What?

                  KENNY
            Jody, we've been going out
            for over a year. I love you
            but I'm all out of patience.

Jody doesn't know what to say. She didn't expect this.

EXT.  MARKEN HOUSE

Jody gets out of the car, very upset. Kenny takes off, not even waiting to 
see if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street. A 
car backfires in the distance. A nearby noise  startles her. Something's 
behind the garbage cans. She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing 
behind the house.

INT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE - BACK FOYER

All is quiet in the house. The back door opens. Jody tiptoes up back 
staircase.

INT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE

Jody appears on the second floor. It's a family house, politely decorated 
and immaculately clean. She quietly creeps down the hallway toward her 
room. As she passes her parents' room, she looks down. She's relieved that 
no light is coming from under their door.

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 

Jody creeps into her bedroom and quietly shuts the door. She's made it. 
She sits on the bed to catch her breath.

Something moves in the corner of her room. Jody jumps, scared.
Someone is sitting in her rocking chair.

                 BRENT
            It's almost ten o'clock.

                 JODY
            Daddy you scared me!

                 BRENT
            You're grounded Friday night!

                 JODY
            What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST
            LOST TRACK OF TIME.

BRENT MARKEN gets up and heads to the door. He's a big man, 45 years old, 
well built. He's dressed in a  tree-shirt and jeans.

                 BRENT
            Your curfew is 9:30 and you
            know it, little miss.

                 JODY
            It won't happen again.

                 BRENT
            You said that two weeks ago.

                 JODY
           Dad ! Most of my friends can
           stay out until 11 on school nights
           and 1 on weekends!

                 BRENT
           They're not all the sheriff's daughter.
           Goodnight.

He leaves. Jody is furious. She lies down on the bed to stew. She might at 
well have stayed out. The phone in the hallway rings. She leaps up.

INT.  HALLWAY

Jody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before 
picking it up. She crosses her fingers, praying it's Kenny.

                 JODY
            Hello. (beat) One second.
                (to her dad)
            Hey Adolph, it's the station!

Brent comes out and picks up the phone as Jody heads back to her room, 
disappointed.

INT.  BEDROOM

Jody flops on the bed.

                 BRENT(O.C.)
            Hello. (beat) What?

INT.  HALLWAY

Brent it shocked.

                 BRENT
            Where?

MARGE MARKEN, Jody's mother, comes out of the bedroom, sensing something 
terrible has happened. Marge is a couple of years older than Brent. She's 
a bit lifeless, a pretty woman who's whole life is her daughter and a 
bottle of Peachtree Schnapps.

                 BRENT(CONT'D)
            I'm on my way.

INT.  JODY'S

Jody sits up on her bed, also sensing something big has happened.

INT.  HALLWAY

Brent buttons up his shirt.

                  MARGE
            What happened?

                  BRENT
            Two kids were found mutilated
            in the woods. Lock the door
            after me.

Brent grabs his gun belt and heads down the stairs.

Jody appears. She and her mom share a concerned glance.

CUT TO:

EXT. STACY'S HOUSE

Brent pulls up. A lot of official cars are already there.

EXT. WOODS

A trail of flares eerily light up the woods, leading to the crime scene.

EXT.  WOODS

The murder sit. Police cameras flash. Stacy is still nailed to the tree. 
Rod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood.

Brent walks up, immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight. His deputy, 
JACK WEBBER, sidles up next to him.

                  DEPUTY
           Her parents reported her missing about
           an hour ago.

A flash bulb momentarily lights up the scene. Brent pulls out his 
flashlight to better survey the carnage.

He starts on Rod, throat slit, chest gutted. He then moves to Stacy, 
looking at one nailed hand, then the other.

                  BRENT
           What kind of a person wakes
           up in the morning and says
           to themselves, 'Think I'll nail
           a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?

                  DEPUTY
           The same type that decides to carve into
           her stomach.

Brent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach. Carved into 
her flesh is the word 'VIRGIN'.

CUT TO:

MONTAGE

High school kids are getting ready for school.

Body parts are being covered. Pants and stocking are pulled up over bare 
teenage legs.

Shirts and bras cover bare teenage chests.

Zippers are pulled tight. Buttons are buttoned.

The school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars, on bikes, walking.

IT'S A TYPICAL small town American high school, somewhat repressed but 
alive. The news spreads quickly about the double killing as the crowd 
splits into its various tribes: punk rockers, jocks, potheads, 
cheerleaders, nerds.

The killing is on everyone's mind.

EXT.  SCHOOLYARD

Jody rides up on her bike and glances across the schoolyard as she locks 
it in the bike rack.

Jody's POV - Kenny is leaning against a tree, talking with a busty girl, 
SHARON.

Jody is upset to see Kenny flirting with someone else. As she starts 
toward the front door of the school, a few other CLASSMATES run up to her. 
She keeps glancing over at Kenny but he doesn't notice her.

                  CLASSMATE 1
                Jody!

                  JODY
                Hi.

                  CLASSMATE 2
                 Was Stacy raped?

                  JODY
                I dunno. My dad never came home
                last night.

Jody's POV - Kenny takes Sharon's hand for a second.

                  CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
                I bet she was. I heard someone
               stuffed a tent spike up her ass.

                  CLASSMATE 2(O.C.)
                Gives new meaning to the idea
                 of getting 'nailed'.

                  CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
                Ha-ha. So funny. Sickfuck.

Jody doesn't respond. She stares at Kenny.

Jody's POV - Kenny walks into school with Sharon.

CUT TO:

INT.  HOMEROOM

Jody enters her homeroom, still upset.

Her teacher LEONARD MARLISTON is lecturing the class. Leonard is twenty-
five and quite hip looking for a teacher. He has long somewhat stringy 
brown hair. He is a bit thin and is dressed casually, almost in hippy 
attire. He wears wire-rim glasses and lace-up boots.

                    MR. MARLISTON
             No one understands what leads people
             to do irrational things. We only
             know that unpunished violence
             festers, then explodes.

Jody sits down in the back.

                      MARLISTON(CONT'D)
             Witness the L.A. Riots. Years of
             police brutality in forty-eight hours. Jody?

                      JODY
             Yes Mr. Marliston?

                     MR. MARLISTON
             Your dad's in the principal's office.
             He wants to see you.

INT.  HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

Brent is talking to TOM SISLER, the principal. Tom is a wiry, hard 
featured man in his mid-forties. They have known each other for a long 
time but are not really friends. Brent knows Tom too well. Tom's a cynical 
bastard.

Tom is examining the photos taken at the crime scene.

                     TOM
              You aren't planning to tell these kids
              that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy
              and Rod, are you?

                    BRENT
              No.

                    TOM
              Good.

                    BRENT
              But I am going to have to question
              all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.

                    TOM
              Fine, just don't mention the carving
              This is going to be a tough enough day
              as it is.

There's a knock at the door. Jody enters.

                    BRENT
              Hi honey.

                    JODY
              Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.

                    TOM
              Hi Jody.

                    BRENT
              I just wanted to check that
              you were okay?

                   JODY
              I'm fine. I've just never had
              someone my age die before.
              It's so weird.

                   BRENT
              How well did you know Stacy and
              Rod?

                   JODY
              I've been in the same class
              with Stacy for years but we
              weren't tight or anything.

                   BRENT
              Had either of them broken
              up with someone recently?
              Hurt someone?

                   JODY
              No. Those two were together
              before Kenny and I started
              hanging out and that's over,
              what, God a year now.

                   BRENT
              I want you to head right home
              after school.

                   JODY
              I will. Is that all?

                   TOM
              Could you tell Mr. Marliston
              we'd like to see him.

                   JODY
              SURE.

She leaves.

                   BRENT
              Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?

                   TOM
              The kids adore him. They confide
              in him. His patchouli reeking rear
              might know if Stacy and Rod were
              really virgins. Why didn't you
              ask Jody that?

                   BRENT
              She's my daughter, Tom.

                   TOM
              So?

                   BRENT
              So you just don't point
              blank ask your teenage daughter
              about sex.

                   TOM
              Why not? You worried you might
              find out how much she actually
              knows?

Brent gives Tom a 'keep your cynical shit off my daughter' look.

                   LEONARD
              You rang?

                   TOM
              Come in Leonard. Have you
              met Brent Marken?

                   LEONARD
              No but I've always wanted to.

He shakes his hand firmly.

                   BRENT
              Nice to meet you too. My
              daughter speaks highly of you.

Leonard examines Brent's face carefully. Brent is a little taken aback by 
his intensity.

                   LEONARD
              We have the same color eyes.

                   BRENT
              I guess we do.

CUT TO:

INT. CAFTERIA

MARK SHALE, a seventeen year old, rail thin pothead is sitting at a table 
in the crowded cafeteria eating lunch. The place is a zoo. CINDY, a cute, 
mini-skirted brunette, and BEN,  a frizzy-haired, tattooed, pierced, punk-
rocker, are sitting with him.

Jody is standing at the door with her best friend SANDY, looking for a 
place to sit. Sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age. She 
is wearing very little make-up, a baggy shirt and baggy jeans. Although 
she looks much more tomboyish than Jody and a year or two younger, she is 
still quite cute and curvy, just lacking a  bit in self-confidence when it 
comes to boys. Sandy is staring at Mark.

                   JODY
             Go sit next to him.

                   SANDY
             Who?

                   JODY
             Mark Shale.

                   SANDY
             Why?

                   JODY
             Don't you want to talk to him?
             You watch him eat everyday.

                   SANDY
             I don't watch him eat everyday.

                   JODY
             You stare at him non-stop,
             like every lunch. Like this. Like
             most people stare at car accidents.

Jody imitates Sandy.

                   SANDY
             The seat behind him is open. Come on,
             I can eavesdrop too.

                   JODY
             You eventually have to talk to him.

                   SANDY
             Why? All my mom and dad ever do is
             watch each other eat and they've been
             married for twenty years.

Cindy sees Jody approaching and motions her over.

                   CINDY
             Jody!

Jody starts toward her table.

                   SANDY
              No! That's his table.

                   JODY
              You're going to look really
              amoebic splitting off from me now.

The other three kids look up as Jody sits don.

Sandy has no choice but to sit down next to Mark. She immediately freezes 
up.

                   CINDY
              Did your dad question you
              this morning?

                   JODY
              Just a little.

                   BEN
              Did he ask you if Stacy
              and Rod has ever exchanged
              bodily fluids?

                   JODY
              No. Why?

                   CINDY
              He asked Marliston.

                   JODY
              If they had ever gone all the way?

                   BEN
              Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED
              OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

                  CINDY
              I wonder why it's so important
              to know if they fucked?

Sandy is completely frozen. Jody realizes it. Mark is paying no attention 
to her.

                   BEN
              What I don't understand is
              why they asked Marliston if
              Rod was a virgin. They could have
              asked you Cindy.

                  CINDY
              I never fucked Rod.

                  BEN
              Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.

Jody nudges Sandy under the table, trying to prompt her to say something. 
Sandy can only stare at Mark as he eats.

                   CINDY(O.C.)
              If I'm so all-used-up Ben,
              why do you try to hook me
              up non-stop?

                  BEN(O.C.)
              As fucking if.

Across the cafeteria, a sophomore ANNETTE storms in very upset. She 
confronts DYLAN, her junior boyfriend.

                  ANNETTE
              You're a shitsucking liar!

                  DYLAN
                (taunting)
              Better than being a 'cocksucking'
              liar!

                  ANNETTE
              Shut your face!

Annette leaps on Dylan and starts violently scratching him. Mr. Marliston 
runs over and pulls her off. He drags Annette away.

                  ANNETTE
               He's been telling people....

                   LEONARD
              You can tell me all about it in
              my office. Calm down. We're all
              on edge today.

He guides her out.

Sandy gets up her nerve and makes eye contact with Mark.

                   SANDY
               What's up with that?

Mark opens a TWINKIE and starts to eat it.

                   MARK
               Dylan's been telling people
               that Annette gave him a blow
               job.

                   SANDY
               And she didn't?

Ben and Mark laugh.

                   BEN
                There's a better chance that he
                got head from all five Spice Girls.

                  SANDY
                That's horrible.

Cindy laughs at Sandy. Sandy doesn't appreciate being laughed at.

                  CINDY
                I think it's funny.

                  BEN
               Me too. I'm going to start
               telling people that I saw her drop
                to her knees and latch on to his
                unit vector.

Cindy laughs. The first meeting hasn't gone well for Sandy. Jody feels for 
her and jumps to her rescue.

                   JODY
                You wouldn't?

                  BEN
                I would if Dylan paid me.

INT.  SCHOOL

The bell rings. It's the end of the day.

EXT.  SCHOOL

All the kids charge out. Jody walks out with Sandy.

                  SANDY
               (flustered)
              What am I supposed to say?
              'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you
              buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'

                  JODY
                (teasing a bit)
              You could tell him you really
              liked the way he chews with his
              back molars.

                 SANDY
              You're so fucking lucky your
              dad is the sheriff.

                 JODY
              You are 'sp fucking' wrong.

                 SANDY
              You get to be a little Chelsea
              Clinton. Everyone wants to meet
              you. Party with you. Have sex with you.

                 JODY
              But you can't do any of it.
              So it sucks. I always have to
              'set an example'.

Jody stops, noticing something.

EXT.  PARKING LOT

Jody's POV - Kenny is walking to his car with Sharon.

Sandy sees how upset Jody is.

                  SANDY
               He's just trying to mess
               with your head. Ignore
               him.

                   JODY
               Does she fuck?

                  SANDY
               (trying to comfort)
               I doubt it. Who'd want
               to fuck her. She probably
               reeks worse than the docks
               down in those panties.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET 

Jody is slowly pedaling her bicycle next to Sandy.

                   JODY
                (frustrated)
              Mr. Jenkins called on me in
              class today. It was so embarrassing.
              I was seriously spaced. I'd been thinking
              about Kenny for over twenty minutes.
              When I snapped out of it, I looked pathetic.
              I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me.

                  STACY
             What did you say?

                  JODY
             That I was sorry. I'd drifted off.
             That I'd been thinking about Stacy
             and Rod.

                  SANDY
             Oh nice save.

                  JODY
             I was desperate. It was gross.

                  SANDY
             Kenny'll come running back.
             This is just his way of pressuring
             you.

                  JODY
             He says he loves me.

                  SANDY
             Personally I think he has a deep,
             almost pathological desire to corrupt
             you. But I suppose that's a type of love.
             I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.

                  JODY
                 (musing)
            Maybe I should blister through a bottle of
            Tequila and just fuck his brains out.

                  SANDY
            No!

                  JODY
            You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.

                  SANDY
            That was before he pulled this 'Dick me
            or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best
            friend.

Jody laughs.

                  JODY
            I don't know what I'm so scared of.

                  SANDY
            Want to come in for awhile?
            Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men,
            head into a private S&M chat room . . .

                  JODY
            How do you know what to type back when
            they start to cyber with you.

                  SANDY
            I keep a couple of my dad's porno books
            hidden in my desk for emergency reference.

Jody laughs.

                  JODY
            I promised I'd go right home after school.

                  SANDY
            OK. increase the peace.

Sandy hip-hops up her driveway and into her house. Jody jumps on her bike 
and pedals off down the street.

Dissolve to:

EXT. CHERRY FALLS - NIGHT

Night has set again on the town. An OWL HOOTS. THE STREETS ARE QUIET.

EXT.  STREET

The killer's car, the black IMPERIAL, lurks in the shadows of a suburban 
street. The killer is staking out a specific house.

EXT.  ANNETTE'S HOUSE

Annette, the girl who flipped out in the cafeteria appears at the front 
door. Her MOTHER and FATHER are going out.

They kiss ANNETTE goodbye, get in their car and drive away. Annette heads 
back inside and double locks the door.

Annette's parents pull up in front of a restaurant and head inside.

THE KILLER'S IMPERIAL PULLS up across the street.

INT.  RESTAURANT

The killer's car drives away.

EXT.  ANNETTE'S

A gloved finger pushes in the back doorbell.

INT.  BACK HALLWAY

Annette opens the back door. It's chain locked. She peeks through the 
chain,

EXT. HOUSE

Someone is standing there in the shadows.

                  KILLER(O.C.)
              HI. Annette?

It's a WOMAN'S VOICE.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT.  HOUSE

Annette has never seen this woman before. WE still don't see the killer's 
face.
     
                  ANNETTE
                 (suspicious)
             Yeah?

                  KILLER(O.C.)
            I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's
            aunt. He asked me to come
            talk to you.

                  ANNETTE
            Why?

                  KILLER(O.C.)
            He feels terrible about those things
            he said to you in school.

                 ANNETTE
                 (really angry)
           He should. Four guys hit on me today,
           and not because they find me intellectually
           stimulating.

                 KILLER(O.C.)
           I think I know how to restore your
           reputation.

                  ANNETTE
                (excited)
           You do?

                  KILLER(O.C.)
           Can I come in? I'll need to use the
           phone.

Annette isn't sure what to do but this is too important to pass up.

                  ANNETTE
            Sure.

Annette unlocks the chain. The killer heads inside.

THE DOOR OMINOUSLY closes behind them.

INT.  RESTAURANT

Wine is being poured into already half-filled glasses.

Annette's parents and the other couple are now a little tipsy, much looser 
than when we saw them earlier. They are laughing, rubbing each other, 
getting physical.

The other HUSBAND leans in and kisses Annette's' mother on the nose. 
Annette's father is at first taken aback but then he responds by kissing 
the other WIFE on the ear. They all laugh. It's getting fancy for Cherry 
Falls.

INT.  HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

ANNETTE comes charging down the hallway, groggy, bleeding profusely from 
the side of her head, terrified.

The door handle moves. The killer is on the other side.

Annette picks up the telephone. it's dead.

The killer kicks the door a couple of times.

Annette backs away from the door, all the way to the window. She grabs a 
sharp pen, holding it like it's a knife. The kicking stops, All is 
momentarily quiet.

Suddenly the killer's shadow appears in the window behind Annette. The 
window smashes an d Annette's neck is pulled towards the shards of glass 
that remain in the broken window.

Annette struggles but she's not strong enough.

INT.  HALLWAY

Annette's mom starts down the hallway, noticing the trail of blood leading 
to Annette's door, realizing something is wrong.

                   MOTHER

It begins to splinter.

INT.  BEDROOM

They break through. Annette's dad pushes the dresser out of the way and 
they barge in.

The room seems to be empty except the window has been broken and blood's 
splattered around it.

                   MOTHER
             Annette?

She notices the shade to the other window has been drawn and is flapping 
oddly, caught on something.

She walks over, frightened, gathers her nerve, then pulls the shade up.

Annette has been nailed to the outside of the house, her dead eyes looking 
in.

'VIRGIN' is carved deeply in her forehead.

Her mother screams.

             Is Jody still awake?

                  MARGE
             She just turned off her light.

Brent darts up the stairs.

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 

Jody is in bed. There's a soft knock on the door. She rolls over.

                  JODY
             Come in.

Brent walks in and seats himself on the edge of the bed.

                  BRENT
             Hi honey.

                 JODY
             What's wrong?

                  BRENT
             I have a question to ask you.
             A personal question.

Jody sits up, pulling the covers up over her breasts.

                 JODY
               (uncomfortable)
             How personal?

Brent takes a deep breath. He's really uncomfortable.

                  BRENT
             I need to know how far you
             and Kenny went?

Jody is really uncomfortable with this question.

                 JODY
             What do you mean?

                 BRENT
               (gently probing)
            Well, I assume you let him kiss you?

                 JODY
            Well yeah. Of course.
            Everyone kisses.
     
                 BRENT
            I'm not criticizing.
                (very uncomfortable)_
            Did you two get any further?

                  JODY
            A little.

                 BRENT
            How much further?

                 JODY
            Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS
            ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!

                 BRENT
            I wouldn't ask if I didn't have
            to.

                 JODY
            Not much further.

                  BRENT
            You never went, uh, all the way?

                 JOY
               (sighs)
            No.

Brent nods, worried. He's obviously upset.

                 BRENT
               (very worried)
            Ok.

                 JODY
               (confused)
            Daddy, are you upset that
            I'm still a virgin?!

                BRENT
            No honey.

                JODY
            You are upset.

                   BRENT
            I'm not.

                JODY
               (upset)
            I thought you'd be pleased.

                BRENT
            I am. I'm so very proud
            of you. Go back to sleep.

He kisses her on the forehead and heads out. She is very confused.

INT.  LIVING ROOM

Brent comes down the stairs.

                 MARGE
             Well?

                 BRENT
             She's still a virgin.

                 MARGE
             Did you warn her?

                 BRENT
             No. Let her get at least
             one more peacefully night's
             sleep.

EXT.  CHERRY FALLS

It's a new day. As the kids arrive at school, rumors are flying. Everyone 
is a little more on edge. The same tribes exist but kids are starting to 
glance and listen to kids from other tribes. The social structure is 
starting to fray.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

Brent is upset, confused.

                   BRENT
              If I'd gone public with this
              yesterday Annette Michaels might
              be alive today.

                   TOM
              Oh GOD Brent, is there anything
              you don't feel guilty about?

                   BRENT
              is there anything you do?

                    TOM
             Focus on the present. You always
             want to change the past. Let's figure
             out what you are going to tell the parents
             today, not what you should told them
             yesterday.

                   BRENT
             I'm going to tell them everything I know.
             I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.

                   TOM
             You tell these people someone is out there
             killing virgins and we're going to have a     
             goddamn fuckfest on our hands.

                  BRENT
             Better than a pile of dead teenagers.

EXT.  TOWN HALL

The town bell rings in the steeple. It's eight o'clock.

EXT.  MAIN STREET

The shops close down. All the townsfolk head toward the assembly hall.

EXT.  SCHOOL

The parents arrive. They are all concerned. They've all heard rumors by 
now. They hurry into the school, whispering to one another.

INT.  AUDITORIUM

The parents are seated, whispering, buzzing. Brent walks up to the podium. 
He's very nervous as he looks out at the crowd, realizing he's going to 
really, really upset them. He takes a deep breath.

                  BRENT
            I think you all know why I CALLED THIS
            Town meeting. In the last two days, three
            of our children have been murdered and it
            appears that we have now established a common
            link between the killings.

The crowd grows still. Everyone is interested in this information.
Brent pauses.

                   FATHER 1
             Well, what is it?

                   BRENT
             All three of the victims attended our
             public high school and all three were or appear
             to have been...um...virgins.

There is a ripple of confusion that runs through the auditorium.

                   MOTHER 1
             So?

                   MOTHER 2
                (very concerned)
             You're almost positive that's
             who this monster is targeting?

                   MOTHER 1
             Virgins?

                   BRENT
             We found the word 'virgin' written
             at both crime scenes.

                    FATHER 1
             Why didn't you tell us this yesterday?

                   BRENT
             We didn't think this was a serial killer.
             We thought it was an isolated incident.

This is all very upsetting to everyone.

                   MOTHER 3
             Are you close to an arrest?

                   BRENT
             I can't say we are.

                   FATHER 2
             What are we supposed to do?

                   BRENT
             What do you mean?

                    MOTHER 2
             What are we supposed to tell
             our kids?

                   FATHER 2
             To go out and get laid if they
             wanna feel safe?

                   BRENT
             I think that's' up to each and
             everyone of you.

                   FATHER 3
            I can't lock my daughter in
            the basement.

                   FATHER 2
            I wouldn't worry about it Victor.

A few other parents laugh.

                   FATHER 3
            What's that supposed to mean?

                   FATHER 2
            Nothing.

                   FATHER 3
            What are you saying about my
            daughter?

Father 3 starts towards Father 2. Tempers are short.

                   FATHER 2
               (getting worried)
            Calm down. I was joking.

Father 3 pushes Father 2.

                   FATHER 3
            Hell of a time to be joking about
            a thing like that you sick bastard!

Father 3 swings at him. A fight ensues. Other parents start to jump in. 
Tempers are short. Brent leaps down to break it up.

EXT.  TOWN

A match lights a long fuse.

Fire crackles along the ground toward a huge string of firecrackers and 
Roman candles. They ignite. The firecrackers explode as balls of fire 
shoot into the night sky. TEENAGERS howl.

INT.  SANDY'S BEDROOM

Jody is talking on the phone to Sandy. Sandy's room is typical teenage 
room, identical in feel to Jody's.

                    SANDY
               (really worried)
            What are we going to do?

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM

Jody is lying on her bed.

                    JODY
            Sandy, you have to chill out,
            at least two-thirds of the kids
            in our class are still virgins.
            He can't butcher all of us.
     
                    SANDY
            There will be a lot fewer by
            tomorrow night.

EXT.  HOUSE

The killer's imperial pulls up across the street from Jody's.

INT.  JODY'S

                    JODY
            Not that many.

                     SANDY
            You watch. There's going to be
            a hymen holocaust tomorrow.
            Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark
            Shale.

                    JODY
            NO?!

There's a sound on the phone. Sandy's brother ANDY has picked it up.

                   SANDY
            Andy! I'm on the phone!

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS AT SANDY'S

ANDY, Sandy's thirteen year old brother is on the line.

                   ANDY(ON THE PHONE)
             I just wanted to offer my
             services to Jody.

                   SANDY
             Your services?

                    ANDY
             I'm willing to help save her life.
             Jody, if you want to come over right
             now. We could slip up into the attic for
             a few minutes. There's an old mattress
             up there...

                   SANDY
             MOM!

Andy hangs up laughing.

INT.  JODY'S

Jody chuckles but all of a sudden the line goes dead.

                   JODY
              Hello?

Jody tries to call back but the phone isn't working. This spooks her. The 
doorbell rings downstairs. Now Jody is more than spooked. She's SCARED. 
She goes to the window to see who it is.

EXT.  HOUSE 

Someone is standing in the shadows below. All Jody can make out is that 
it's a woman.

INT.  STAIRS

Jody, dressed only in her nightshirt, cautiously heads downstairs to the 
back door.

INT.  BACK HALLWAY

JODY looks through the back door window.

EXT.  BACK DOOR

There's someone in the shadows.

Jody opens the door a crack.

                   JODY
               Yes?

                    KILLER(O.C.)
               Are you Jody?

Once again, a woman's voice.

                    JODY
               Yeah.

                    KILLER(O.C.)
               I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.

                   JODY
               Kenny's aunt?

                  KILLER(O.C.)
               Yes. He asked me to come over
               and talk to you.

Jody senses something is off.

                   JODY
               On what side of the family?

                   KILLER(O.C.)
               His mother's side.

                    JODY
                His mother's an only child.

Jody suddenly gets it and tries to slam the door closed but the killer is 
too fast, sliding a hand and foot in, pushing her way into the house.

Jody fights to push the door shut but she can't. The killer is stronger. 
The killer's hand gropes for the lock latch.

Jody frantically looks around for a weapon and spots an electric 
screwdriver sitting in the back pantry. She grabs for the screwdriver with 
one hand as the killer pushes harder.

Jody drills the killer's elbow.

The killer screams and lets go. Jody slams the door shut, double locking 
it.

INT.  FRONT HALLWAY

Jody runs to the front hall and double locks the front door.

INT.  LIVING ROOM

Jody picks up a phone but it's dead downstairs too. She looks around.

EXT.  HOUSE

The killer seems to be following her.

Jody grabs a baseball bat from the front hall closet. The killer's shadow 
appears outside.

INT.  KITCHEN 

Jody runs into the kitchen, grabs a knife. The window above her breaks. 
The killer is right outside.

INT.  DINING ROOM

Jody runs into the dining room, not sure where to go. Suddenly the window 
breaks there. The killer is stalking her from the outside.

INT.  HOUSE - MONTAGE

THE HOUSE is under siege and Jody is trapped in it. She runs from room to 
room, turning the lights out but windows break wherever she goes. It's 
terrifying.

INT.  FOYER

Suddenly there is a silence. Jody stops running. She realizes that the 
killer must be climbing in somewhere. Jody isn't sure what to do.

She hears something in the family room.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM

Jody enters. She sees the killer's shadow cross the window. She runs out.

INT.  HALLWAY

Jody creeps through the dark house, unsure where to go.

INT.  DEN

Jody creeps back into the den. The killer doesn't seem to be there either.

The window is broken. The curtains flap in the breeze. She moves toward 
it, wondering whether it's safe to climb out. She looks in the mirror.

In the mirror, Jody can see the killer's shoes peeking out from under the 
drapes. The killer's in the room. The drapes start to move.

Jody turns around and swings the bat, hitting the killer squarely in the 
head, sending her to the ground, pulling the drapes down.

INT.  HOUSE

Jody tears for the front door.

INT.  FRONT HALL

Jody's too nervous to unlock the front door.

She hears the killer coming so she tears up the stairs.

INT.  STAIRCASE

Jody scampers up the staircase but she's not fast enough. The killer grabs 
her leg through the wooden slatted banister starts pulling her off the 
staircase, breaking the wooden slats.

Jody grabs one of the jagged slats and rams the sharp end into the 
killer's hand, freeing herself.

INT.  STAIRS

Jody charges up the stairs and into the bathroom.

INT.  BATHROOM

Jody closes the bathroom door and locks it.

The killer starts kicking it in.

INT.  BATHROOM

Jody opens the small bathroom window to climb out on the roof.

The door starts to splinter.

Jody tries to wriggle her way out but it's tight.

Behind her she hears the door splintering open.

EXT.  ROOF

Jody squeezes through and grabs hold of the chimney, using it to pull 
herself out.

INT.  BATHROOM

The killer's hand grabs Jody's leg just as Jody's pulling herself free. 
The killer closes the window on Jody's leg, trapping it inside. Out comes 
the razor.

EXT.  ROOF

Jody fights for her freedom, tugging at the chimney, kicking and 
screaming: All of a sudden she feels a surge of pain. She screams and 
kicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her 
rolling down the roof. She rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the 
gutter, hanging from it.

The gutter starts to break.

Above her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof.

The killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her.

Jody knows she has no choice.

Jody lets go of the gutter.

EXT. BACKYARD

Jody falls twenty feet to the ground below.

                  JODY

THE KILLER IS GONE.

EXT.  BACKYARD

CUT TO:

EXT.  HOUSE

Later that night. Police cars are lined up outside the house.

INT.  HOUSE

Police are scouring the house. Jody is trying to sup some hot chocolate 
but her hands are still shaking.

                JODY
            It was a she.

                 BRENT
            Are you sure?

                JODY
           She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.

Her mom comes in with a bottle of cognac, ready to pour a little into 
Jody's cup.

                BRENT
           What are you doing?

                 MARGE
           This will relax her.

                 BRENT
           She's underage.

Brent motions towards the cops, his co-workers, who are scurrying around 
the house. Mom gives Brent a dirty look and pours just a spot into Jody's 
glass. Sandy enters. She sees Jody and runs to her.

                SANDY
           Oh my god. ARE YOU OK?

Jody breaks into tears. They hug.

                 JODY
           Someone tried to kill me.

                 SANDY
           The phone just went dead.
           I called the police and ran
           right over as fast as I could.

Sandy is really terrified too.

Dissolve to:

EXT.  CHERRY FALLS

Another morning in CHERRY FALLS. The town may look peaceful but it isn't.

INT.  SANDY'S BATHROOM

Sandy is getting dressed in her usual manner but he hand is shaking. She's 
still terrified. She looks at herself in the mirror and decides to make a 
change.

Lipstick goes on. mascara and eyeliner follow.

Sandy examines herself in the mirror. She's all made-up. SHE USUALLY wears 
a tenth as much.

INT.  SANDY'S BEDROOM

Sandy slides into a slightly provocative dress. She looks much hotter than 
she did when we first met her.

INT.  STAIRCASE

Sandy starts down the stairs. She stops to check out where her mother is.

INT.  KITCHEN

SANDY'S MOTHER is making breakfast.

INT.  STAIRCASE

Sandy hurries downstairs, grabs her coat and heads out the door, hoping 
her mom won't notice how she's dressed.

Her mom hears her and catches a glimpse of her new outfit.

                 MOTHER
            You're wearing a skirt?

Sandy doesn't want to get into it. She charges right out the door.

                 SANDY
            Bye mom.

EXT.  SANDY'S HOUSE

Sandy goes tearing up the street as her mother opens the door after her.
                 MOTHER
            SANDY?!

No way is Sandy turning around.

EXT.  SCHOOL

The kids arrive at School. Everyone is freaked. The word spreads fast 
about Jody's attack. Many of the kids, like Sandy, have worn a little 
extra make-up or a little tighter jeans. There's a sexual electricity 
everywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.

The normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are 
sexual tribes. Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids 
together. Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth. Punkers chat with nerds, 
cheerleaders with potheads.

In the parking lot, we see that Aunt Lisa's IMPERIAL is parked. The killer 
is close by.

EXT.  FRONT OF SCHOOL

Sandy arrives at school. She looks around.

She spots Mark talking with Cindy and BEN. She gathers her confidence up, 
unbuttons her top button to reveal what cleavage she has, and starts 
towards them.

Cindy is laughing at Ben.

                 CINDY
             I'm not fucking you.
             Not for all your CDS.

                  BEN
             You want me to die? I thought
             you and I were tight.

                 CINDY
             ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?

                 BEN
             WOULD that impress you?
             IS that what it takes to
             impress the empress?

                 CINDY
             Your mind is just twisted enough.
             I believe you'd do all this just to
             get a dip or two.

Sandy walks up.
                 SANDY
             Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.

                  MARK
             Hi Sandy.

They all stare at her for a second, noticing the change in her appearance.
                 BEN
             Did you want something?

Sandy freezes. She doesn't known what to say.

                  SANDY
               (almost frozen)
            Yes.(beat) I was just curious
            Mark, if you brought a Twinkie
            today?

Ben and Cindy crack up. That was a really lame, stupid question.

                 BEN
              (sarcastically)
            You wonder about that everyday Sandy?

                 MARK
            Shut up Ben.
                 (to sandy)
            Actually, my mom always
            packs two.

                  SANDY
            You got a great mom.
            I'm lucky to get a zucchini
            stick.

                  MARK
            Did you want one?

                  SANDY
             (trying to cover)
            Yeah I was talking about Twinkies
            the other day and I realized I hadn't had one
            in years. Then I remembered seeing you with
            one.

                   MARK
            They're tasty.

He gets out the Twinkie and gives it to her. She unwraps it and takes a 
bite. Ben and Cindy watch, amazed and entertained.

                 SANDY
            Thanks.

Sandy gets  a little cream on her cheek and licks it away with her tongue, 
a little embarrassed. The sight of her tongue turns Mark on.

                 MARK
            You can have both if you want.

                 SANDY
            No, you keep one.

Cindy laughs. The pairing up has started.

CUT TO:

INT.  POLICE STATION

Jody is sitting in the police station working with a SKETCH ARTIST.

                  JODY
           A little larger nose.

The artist makes a change.

                 ARTIST
           How's that?

Jody re-examines the picture. She's spooked.

                  JODY
           That's her.

The artist picks up the phone and dials.

                  ARTIST
           Brent, we got a sketch.

Brent comes into the room and picks up the sketch, 

FOR THE FIRST TIME we see a picture of the killer. She looks about 
eighteen years old and has her hair done in an old fashioned wave. She 
looks like your average small town girl from the late sixties.

Brent's face goes white when he sees who it is.

Jody notices this.
               
                  JODY
             You know her?

                  BRENT
             It can't be.

                  JODY
             Who is she Daddy?

                  BRENT
             Never mind darling.
             You go back to school.
             I don't want you missing
             anymore classes today.

He picks up the picture and heads quickly into his own office. Jody 
watches through his window, sensing he's very, very upset.

INT.  OFFICE

Brent picks up the phone and quickly dials a number.

INT.  MAIN ROOM

Jody has never seen her dad like this. She quietly picks up the phone and 
listens in.

Her dad is talking to the principal, Tom Sisler.

                 BRENT
           IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still
           looks like we're eighteen.

                  TOM
              (on phone)
            That's impossible.

                  BRENT
              (growing frantic)
           I swear to God. It's her.
           She told Jody she was Kenny's
           'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this
           sickly feeling...

                  TOM
           Calm down Brent.

INT.  OFFICE

Brent looks out and sees that JODY is on the phone, eavesdropping.

                  BRENT
           I'll call you right back.

INT.  MAIN ROOM

Jody, busted, hangs up.

Brent comes storming out. HER FATHER is livid. SHE'S NEVER SEEN HIM SO 
ANGRY AND UPTIGHT.

                 BRENT
            You were eavesdropping.

                  JODY
              (a little scared)
            No I wasn't.

                  BRENT
           What did you hear?

                  JODY
           Nothing. I just picked up the phone
           to say goodbye to you. You didn't say
           goodbye.

                  BRENT
           Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.

She nods and heads out, freaked. Her father's never treated her this 
harshly before.

EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL

As Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the 
attack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture. 
She hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a 
Girl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone 
badly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more 
feet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's 
just a  couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes.

Jody heads toward the main school entrance. She starts noticing a lot of 
kids are outside, a few more hidden from sight, having sex. Something's 
up. 

INT.  HIGH SCHOOL

Jody opens her locker. Sandy comes running up to her, very excited.

                 SANDY
            You ok?

                 JODY
           (noticing Sandy's attire)
           FINE. Are you?

                  SANDY
           Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the
           whole school. Guess what?

                  JODY
           What?

                  SANDY
              (whispering)
            Mark invited me to the party.

                  JODY     
             What party?

                  SANDY
           Shh. Ben's party. Tonight.
           Haven't you heard?

                 JODY
           No.

Sandy notices that a teacher is nearby. Sandy pulls Jody into a stairwell.

INT.  STAIRWELL

Jody is now really intrigued.

                  SANDY
              (whispering)
           You can't tell your parents.

                  JODY
           Ok.

                  SANDY
           Especially not your dad.

                  JODY
           I won't.

                  SANDY
             (whispering)
           It's like a pop your cherry party.
           Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.

                 JODY
           You're thinking of sleeping with Mark
           tonight?

                  SANDY
           Unless he makes a move during
           seventh period.

                  JODY
           Didn't you have something a little
           more romantic in mind for your first
           time?

                 SANDY
             (very excited)
           I kind of like the idea that we can all
           lose it together, on the same night.
           It'll be a lot less scary. You have to
           go.

                 JODY
           Stag?

                SANDY
           Kenny'll want to go with you.
           Cindy's holding a Q and A
           session at the bleachers.
           Come on.

                JODY
           I can't right now.

                 SANDY
           Jody, you have to go to the party.
           For your own safety.

Sandy takes off.

EXT.  BLEACHERS

Cindy is setting with a group of girls, the center of attention.

                CINDY
            You all are such hypocrites.
            All year long you sit on your
            judgmental little butts and 
            call me the slut from hell.
            NOW YOU RUN TO ME, quaking in fear,
            BEGGING for advice...

                HYPOCRITE GIRL 1
           Yeah. SO?

                 HYPOCRITE GIRL 2
           What were we supposed to call you
           Cindy?

                 GIRL 1
           The slut from heaven?

                GIRL 3
            Just answer our questions please?

Sandy runs up.

                CINDY
               (loving the role)
           What do you want to know?

                 GIRL 3
           What to do.

                CINDY
           You have to do everything
           Boys are totally clueless when
           it comes to sex.

This answer terrifies the audience.

                 CINDY(cont'd)
           It starts with them trying to
           unhook our bras, fumbling around,
           and never changes. Wait until they try
           to put their dicks in you.

                 GIRL 2
           Please don't say they need our help
           with that.

                 CINDY
           Always. Unless you want them to just
           poke around endlessly.

The girls had no idea.

INT.  CAR

Three stoners are smoking a bowl in their car. They are not nearly as 
collaborative or supportive of one another as the girls were.

                BOY 1
           Romeo here asked me if chicks has two
           holes or three.

                 BOY 2
           I did not.

                BOY 1
           You did so.

                 BOY 2
           I was kidding.

                BOY 3
           Were not dude.

                 BOY 1
           I know it's a total bummer
           that three kids are dead, but, I'm sorry,
           this is kind of great.

                 BOY 3
           I'm way into this. This may be the best
           of all possible worlds.

                 BOY 2
           No. The killer could be offing
           chicks who haven't given head.

They all laugh again and nod, slapping hands, Beavis and Butt-head style.
                BOY 2
           Then I'd only have to worry about
           one.

They all laugh again.

EXT.  PARKING LOT

Two HOMELY GIRLS, one rail thin, the other slightly overweight, walk back 
towards the school.

                 HOMELY GIRL 1
           We'll meet someone at the party.

                 HOMELY GIRL 2
           You don't know that.

                 HOMELY GIRL 1
           If we don't, we sit back and watch
           everyone else camel.
           That's got to be better than
           hanging at your house.

                 HOMELY GIRL 2
           I'm not going.

They notice a group of kids huddled around a car.

                  HOMELY GIRL 1
           What's that?

They walk up.

'VIRGIN' has been written in blood on one of the windshields.  A mutilated 
boy looks out of the driver's window of the car.  The girl's faces go 
white. IT'S ANOTHER BODY!

More and more kids gather around the murder site. The kids are all 
freaked, giving each other the eye. No one wants to be next.

All of a sudden the body moves, screaming to the heavens, freaking all the 
kids out. The dead body leaps out of the car and runs away as other kids 
and teachers run over. Everyone heard the scream.

Homely girl 2 whispers to her friend.

                   HOMELY GIRL 2
                (whispering)
             Ok. Pick me up at seven.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Chaos has taken over the school. Hardly anyone is still going to classes.

Kenny is standing in the hallway, looking for Jody. He knows her class 
schedule and that she'll be passing by.

Jody appears from her classroom. She starts toward Kenny, at first not 
noticing him.

Jody looks up and she sees him. She stops. She knows what he's there to 
talk to her about. He runs over to her.

                   KENNY
                (very concerned)
           Are you O.K.?

                    JODY
           I'm fine.

                    KENNY
           I heard you got attacked.

                   JODY
           I did.

                    KENNY
           I was worried about you.
           Did you hear about the bash?

                    JODY
           Yeah. I think it's really sick.

                    KENNY
           Why?

                    JODY
           Three of our classmates are dead.
           That's not really the occasion
           for a party.

                   KENNY
           Nobody wants to be the fourth.
           Please go with me.

                   JODY
           Did Sharon say no?

                    KENNY
           You know I want to go with you.

                    JODY
           I'm so flattered but I can't.
           I'm grounded.

                    KENNY
            Everyone's grounded. There's a
           killer on the loose.

                    JODY
           No I'm really grounded.
           When I got in late the other night,
           my father was waiting up for me. 

He grabs her passionately.

                    KENNY
           If you don't want to go with me just
           say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
           LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an
           excuse. I'm so sick of it.

                   JODY
           I'm not using him as an excuse.

OF COURSE SHE IS.

                   KENNY
           Yes you are. You always do.
           It's why we broke up. You always
           hide behind him.
     
                    JODY
           I do not.

                    KENNY
           I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S
           permission just to kiss you.
           Jody, it's time to assert yourself
           To be a big girl. An individual.
           I'm going to this party tonight.
           Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my
           house after school. We'll go together.

                   JODY
           I have to go home after school.
           I have something really important
           I have to ask my mom.

                 KENNY
           They're not picking me up until six.

                 JODY
           I'll think about it.

                  KENNY
           Yes!

He kisses her full throttle. She's into it. She smiles at him as he darts 
off. She's happy but scared. She's got her guy back, at least for the 
moment.

INT.  SCHOOL

The clock strikes three. The bell rings.

EXT.  SCHOOL

Kids charge out, ready for a memorable evening.

INT.  JODY'S HOUSE

Jody's mother is in the kitchen, preparing dinner, watching TV.

                 REPORTER
                (on TV)
          A series of savage killings has turned
          this small community of Cherry Falls, Ohio
          inside out. In the last two days, three teenagers
          have been killed, a fourth attacked. The killer
          seems to be targeting high school virgins. Here's
          our WWJB reporter Mike Stanton outside the local
          high school with an up to the minute report.

EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL

MIKE STANTON turns around toward the high school to report on the day's 
events but before he can get a word out a young GIRL who has recognized 
him, walks up to him. Her GIRLFRIENDS giggle behind her.

                 GIRL
            Hi.

                 MIKE
            Hi, I'm Mike Stanton.

                 GIRL
            I know.

She grabs him and kisses him. He's shocked. She runs off giggling with her 
friends. A boy walks through in the background and makes a lewd hip 
humping gesture at the TV camera.

INT.  KITCHEN

Jody's mom can't believe what she's seeing on the news.

EXT.  HOUSE

Jody walks in the back door.

INT.  KITCHEN

Her mom flips off the TV AS Jody enters the kitchen.

                  JODY
              Hi mom.

                   MARGE
              Hi princess.

                   JODY
              Mom?

                   MARGE
              Yes?

                  JODY
             I need to ask you something.

                   MARGE
             You can ask me anything.

                  JODY
             Have you ever heard of someone
             named Lisa Sherman?

Mom's cutting hand starts to shake. She pretends that she doesn't know who 
Lisa Sherman is but she obviously does.

                   MARGE
             Lisa Sherman?

                   JODY
             Yeah. Who is she?

                   MARGE
             I don't know. Where did you
             hear that name.

                   JODY
             I overheard daddy mentioning
             her to someone. I he thinks she's the
             killer.

                  MARGE
             What?
     
                  JODY
             That's what he said.

                  MARGE
             Did he say anything else about her?

                   JODY
             No but he got really weird.
             Like I've never seen him act.
             REALLY angry and super uptight.

                   MARGE
                (lying)
             I've never heard of her.
             Maybe something else was on
             his mind.

                   JODY
             No. I think she lived her a
             long time ago. Like twenty-eight
             years ago. When dad was eighteen.

                  MARGE
             Not that I know of.

Jody is suspicious. Jody thinks for a moment, then picks her coat back up.

                  MARGE
             Where are you going?

                   JODY
             The library. I'll be fine.

Jody heads out the door. Her mother goes to the window, very concerned and 
watches her ride away. She picks up the phone.

INT.  POLICE STATION - BRENT'S OFFICE

BRENT is on the phone. His deputy is with him.

                  BRENT
           What's the address?
           Thanks.

He hangs up the phone.

                  DEPUTY
           You found her?

                  BRENT
           There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty
           miles west of here. Over the Indiana border.
           I'm going.

                 DEPUTY
           We need you here. I can bring her in.

                 BRENT
           No. I'll handle this.

INT. STATION

Brent and the deputy head into the main station area. Brent grabs his gun. 
The DESK SERGEANT is on the phone.

                 DESK SERGEANT
           Sir, we're getting calls from other
           towns. Boys throughout the country have
           heard about what's going on here and they're
           heading our way, apparently, looking for girls.

                 BRENT
           Put a squad car at every entrance to town.

The desk sergeant picks up another call.

                  SERGEANT
           Your wife's on line three.

                 BRENT
           I can't talk to her now.

                  SERGEANT
           There's a problem with Jody.

                 BRENT
           Tell her she has to handle it.

He heads outside.

EXT.  POLICE STATION

The deputy walks Brent to his car.

                 DEPUTY
            As bizarre as it may sound,
            seems someone is planning to
            have a big party tonight.

                 BRENT
            No?

                  DEPUTY
           Should we close down any eruption?

                 BRENT
           Are you sure?

                 DEPUTY
           We're seeing all the signs in town.

                 BRENT
           I like the idea of all the kids in
           one place. If it happens, just keep
           a man outside until you hear from me.
           I'll be back in a couple of hours.

He jumps in his car and speeds away.

EXT.  LIBRARY

The gray old ivy-covered town library. Jody rides up and heads inside.

INT.  LIBRARY

Jody enters the vast library. It's empty. Almost spooky. A seventy year 
old lady, MISS DUNLOP is behind the desk, robotically stamping the back 
flaps of books.

                 MISS DUNLOP
           Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?

                  JODY
           Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep
           the old town papers?

                  MISS DUNLOP
           They're all on microfiche.
           What year are you looking for?

                 JODY
           Twenty eight years ago.

                 MISS DUNLOP
           Follow me.

INT.  LIBRARY - UPSTAIRS

They head up the stairs and into the microfilm room.

                 JODY
           This place is empty.

                MISS DUNLOP
           Everyone's getting ready for the party.

                 JODY
           You heard about that?

                MISS DUNLOP
           Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP
           IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering
           about it all day.

                JODY
           Don't you think it's sick?

                 MISS DUNLOP
           Not at all. In fact, I thought
           about going.

                JODY
           You Miss Dunlop?

She hands Jody the microfiche.

                MISS DUNLOP
           Unfortunately I qualify.
           Think I'm too old?
          
                JODY
              (lying)
           No.

               MISS DUNLOP
           You're sweet. I really wish
           someone had thrown a party          
           like that when I was your age.           
           My life might have been very
           different.

SHE SLOWLY HEADS DOWN THE STAIRS.

cut to:

INT.  LIBRARY - MICROFICHE ROOM

The newspaper headlines from 1970 pass by.

Jody is watching them flash by.

She slows down, then goes back. She's found what she's looking for.

A picture of LISA SHERMAN. It's her yearbook picture. She looks eerily 
identical to the picture that Jody drew. The headline reads 'High School 
Senior Attacked In park'.

Jody hears footsteps coming up the stairs. She looks up. The footsteps  
stop.

The old library is still. She senses that someone is watching her.

                  JODY
             (a little scared)
           Is that you Miss Dunlop?

No answer. She hears a bit of rustling from behind one of the shelves of 
books directly behind her.

A book accidentally drops to the ground.

She realizes that someone is right there, watching her.

                  JODY
           Who's there?

She sees a pair of shoes behind the book shelf but she can't see the face. 
The shoes start around the book shelf, toward her.

Jody leaps to her feet, ready to run. Her mom appears.

                  JODY
           Mom? You were spying on me.

Mom looks at the monitor, at the picture of Lisa Sherman's face.

                  MARGE
           I want you to come home with
           me right now, Jody.

                  JODY
           Who is she?

                 MARGE
           She's nobody you should be concerned
           with.

                  JODY
           Whoever tried to kill me
           was made up to look exactly 
           like this picture of Lisa Sherman,
           clothes and all. I think that
           concerns me.

                 MARGE
           Don't make me order you.

Jody sits back down.

                 JODY
           You going to drag me out and me in my
           room until I go to college?

Marge sits down next to Jody and takes her hand.

                 MARGE
           If I have to. Please
           let me protect you.

Jody is at a crossroads. Jody doesn't know what to do. Her mother hugs 
her, puts her arm around her, and almost lifts her out of her seat. She 
leads her down the stairs, away from the old newspaper.

INT.  LIBRARY

Jody's mom leads her across the vast hallway. They come to the door 
leading out of the library. Jody stops and looks back. She sees the old 
spinster Miss Dunlop, stacking the books.

                  JODY
           Wait.
     
                  MARGE
           What?

                  JODY
             (asserting herself)
           I'm not leaving. I want to
           know why you and dad are
           so freaked out. Three of my
           classmates are dead.

Mom doesn't like this at all.

CUT TO:

EXT.  LIBRARY

A beautiful garden on the edge of the library. The autumn wind is blowing. 
The leaves are at the height of foliage. Jody and her mom are seated on a  
carved stone bench.

                  MARGE
           Years ago, something horrible
           happened in this town. When I
           was still in high school. A girl
           named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by
           four drunken seniors.

                   JODY
           Attacked how?

                  MARGE
           She was raped. At least that's
           what she claimed.

                  JODY
           You didn't believe her?

                  MARGE
               (confessing)
           No, I believed her. She was in
           pretty bad shape. Inside and out.
           But the boys were never formally
           charged.

                   JODY
           Why not?

                   MARGE
           They were children of our leading
           citizens, stars of the football team.
           And she was  a loner. An angry girl
           that no one really liked. She'd called
           them 'queers'.

                  JODY
           People thought these guys had a
           right to rape her because she called
           them 'queers'?

                  MARGE
           They were proving to her they weren't.
           They were very drunk. Things were different
           back then. You think kids are sexually
           bottled up today....

                  JODY
           And the police did nothing?

                   MARGE
           EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.

                   JODY
           How could you?

                   MARGE
            I don't know. We just did. I guess
           I was kind of scared going against the gain.
           Against the whole town.

                   JODY
          The word is Mob.

                   MARGE
           I've regretted it ever since.
           Never run with the herd just because
           they're the herd.

                  JODY
           Who were they?

Marge freezes. She didn't want to be asked that.

                   MARGE
           Who?

                   JODY
           The men. Do any of them still
           live around here?

                  MARGE
           Two men left town right after
           it happened.

                  JODY
           You're not telling me something.

Marge takes a deep breath, unsure what to say.

                  MARGE
            Mr. Sisler was one of them.

                  JODY
                (shocked)
             The principal?

                  MARGE
            Yes.

                  JODY
            Who was the fourth?

Marge is stricken. She looks down.

                   MARGE
            God. It's like everything that was
            ever repressed in this town is suddenly
            bubbling up through the ground.

Jody gets it.

                  JODY
            Dad?

Her mother can't deny it any longer.

                  JODY(CONT'D)
              (horrified)
           THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first.
           He was one of them.

                  MARGE
           Not a day has gone by where your     
             father has not torn himself to shreds
           for what happened. We both have...

                  JODY
           NO!

Jody gets up.
                  MARGE
           He dedicated his life to law
           enforcement after...

Jody runs off, very upset.

EXT.  LIBRARY

Jody jumps on her bicycle and speeds off.

EXT.  GARDEN

Marge sits down and stares straight ahead, crushed.

EXT.  INDIANA DIRT ROAD

The rusty old mailbox on the forgotten dirt road reads 'Lisa Sherman'
Brent's police car turns into the driveway.

INT.  CAR

Brent pulls up to the house. he sits and stares for a moment.

EXT.  LISA SHERMAN'S HOUSE

It's a dilapidated old house, uncared for, overgrown, a 'For Sale' sign 
stands crookedly in the front yard.

Brent gets out of the car and heads to the front door, stepping over rusty 
tools and old auto parts.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

Brent lifts his hand and is about to knock. He can't. He walks around in a 
circle, composing himself, preparing himself to face Lisa Sherman after 
all these years. He draws the gun from his holster and knocks.

No one answers.

He knocks again.

No one answers, again.

A WOMAN, THE CARETAKER, appears from the side of the house.

                  CARETAKER
                Hello?

                  BRENT
                I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.

                  CARETAKER
                She's not here.

                  BRENT
               You know where I can find her?

                  CARETAKER
               St. Michael's.

                  BRENT
               She works at a church?

                  CARETAKER
               She resides there. Out back.
               She died a year and a half ago.

Brent feels terribly guilty about what he did to Lisa Sherman, but also 
terribly relieved that he'll never have to face her. It's been a  long 
time since he's confronted his hidden past. He puts his gun away.

                   BRENT
              Of what?

                  CARETAKER
              A bullet to the right cerebellum.

                   BRENT
              She was murdered?

                  CARETAKER
              No. She ate a pistol for lunch
              one day.

Brent can't help but feel responsible.

                   BRENT
              Can you describe her? How old
              was she?

                    CARETAKER
              I never met the woman. I'm just taking
              care of the place until they sell it.

                   BRENT
              Can you get inside?

                   CARETAKER
              I can.

                   BRENT
             I knew Lisa Sherman long ago.
             It's extremely important that I
             get inside and try to verify that it's the
             same woman who lived here.

                   CARETAKER
             I don't give a fuck what your reasons
             are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside
             Otherwise, get a warrant.

He pulls out his wallet.

Cut to:

EXT.  KENNY'S HOUSE

Jody rides up to Kenny's house.

INT.  HOUSE

Kenny sees her from his bedroom window.

INT.  FRONT HALLWAY

Kenny comes tearing downstairs.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

Kenny, opens the front door, very excited.

                   KENNY
               Jody!
               (he kisses her)
               Yes! You're here.

Jody wipes a tear from her eye. Kenny notices how upset she is.

                  KENNT(CONT'D)
              What's the matter?

Jody bursts into tears. She hugs him. He hugs her back and leads her 
inside.

INT.  HOUSE

An old rundown house. The clutter smells. Whoever lived here had little to 
no self respect. Garbage is piled up in every corner, order is nowhere. 
Brent is repulsed by what he sees. he wasn't expecting such chaos. He 
knows he helped create this mess.

                   BRENT
             Is there a picture of her somewhere?

                   CARETAKER
             No pictures. No mirrors.
             Was she a crazy woman when
             you knew her?

                    BRENT
             (feeling very guilty)
             No.

                    CARETAKER
             Couldn't tell she going to off
             herself, huh?

                    BRENT
             No, you couldn't.

                    CARETAKER
            I've been in a lot of people's
            houses and this one's the creepiest.

                    BRENT
            Really?

                    CARETAKER
            Yeah. You should check downstairs.

                    BRENT
            Why?

                    CARETAKER
           People always keep their secrets in their
           attics or in their basements. All the 
           weirdness in this house took place in the
           basement.

The woman flips on the basement light. There are several locks on the 
door. Brent is very scared of what he's going to find down there.

INT.  BASEMENT

Brent steps down into the basement.

It is a combination prison/bedroom. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned 
in years. Water drips for the ceiling. Rat traps are everywhere. Old 
broken child's TOYS are stacked in one corner below some handcuffs which 
are bolted into the wall above a cot. The cot is small, the mattress 
rotted. Old shit lies dried on the floor piss stains line every wall.

Huge nails and odd iron objects sit in one corner.

Brent walks over to the dresser and looks in it. He pulls out a pair of 
grown man's trousers. He examines them.

                  CARETAKER
           They look like they'd fit you.
           Three bucks.

Brent things for a moment then throws the pants down. He darts back up the 
stairs. The caretaker laughs.

INT.  KENNY'S

Jody and Kenny are in Kenny's bedroom, sitting on his bed.

                   KENNY
            All our parents are weirdoes.
            I think my dad is into hookers.
            I know he lit cats on fire when
            he was a kid.

                   JODY
              (all wound up)
           My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking
           Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking
           Rapist.

                   KENNY
             (compassionately)
           I think this is a big part of growing up.
           It's losing your spiritual virginity.
           It's when you finally discover that your
           parents aren't anything they told you they
           were. They're even bigger hypocrites than     
           your friends.

                   JODY
           I can't believe I listened to one word of
           his shit.

                   KENNY
           But if he'd been sent to jail,
           there would be no Jody.

                   JODY
           So I should feel happy that he got
           away with it?

                   KENNY
           I don't know. I kind of am.

Jody, still crying, stares at Kenny for a second then leans in and kisses 
him with everything she's got, Ready for action.

                   KENNY
           Are you coming to the party?

                   JODY
           Let's just start a party right here,
           right fucking now.

Jody quickly takes her own shirt off, rips off his, and pounces on him. 
He's taken aback by her sudden aggressiveness. He has no idea how to 
respond to it.

INT.  TOWN HALL

Brent comes storming out of the hall of records.

INT.  PHONE BOOTH

Frantic dialing. Brent is on the phone.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

The phone rings. The answering machine picks up.

                   BRENT
                (leaving a message)
           Tom? Lisa Sherman is dead. But you'll
           never believe what I found out. Meet
           me at the Roadhouse on Route nine in a
           half hour. We need to talk in private.

As Brent finishes his message the camera moves across the principal's 
desk, first revealing a few blood drops on a piece of paper and then the 
killer's hand, holding the razor. The killer has been listening to the 
message.

Tom, the principal, is sitting in the corner in  a large puddle of his own 
blood, tied to the radiator. He's barely alive. His tongue has been cut 
out, his foot cut off at the ankle and shoved into his mouth. One eye is 
missing, the other one has been left in only so that Tom can look into the 
killer's face as he's tortured.

The razor blade is lifted off the table.

Tom braces himself, gripping his hands, preparing for more pain.

The camera moves back to the phone as we hear Tom gag and then the killer 
walking out of the room.

INT.  KENNY'S

Jody is all over Kenny. He's really weirded out by her aggressiveness.  
She reaches for his crotch and finds that he's soft. She rolls over, 
embarrassed.

                  JODY
                (worried)
            What's wrong? Am I doing something
            wrong?

                   KENNY
            Just making me feel like a piece
            of meat.

                  JODY
           I'm making you feel like meat?

                  KENNY
           Yeah.

Jody rolls over, a bit pissed off and very confused.

                  JODY
           You break up with me because
           I won't fuck you.

                  KENNY
           That's not why we broke up.

                  JODY
           You flaunt some slut in my face.

                  KENNY
           Sharon's far from a slut.

                   JODY
           And when I finally agree to spread
           my legs, you accuse me of treating
           you like meat.

                  KENNY
           Jody, you're only doing this to
           get back at your dad. It doesn't
           have that much to do with me.

She gets up angry, and starts putting her clothes back on. That was the 
wrong note to play. The truth hurts.

                  KENNY
           Please don't go. Please.
           Stay, We'll just talk. Then
           go to the party.

                  JODY
           This party is sick.

She heads to the door.

                  KENNY
           Jody. Wait.

                  JODY
           What?

                  KENNY
           I'm scared. Three kids are
           dead. I want to go to this
           party.

                  JODY
           Then go to the party. Run
           with the herd Kenny. Just
           don't spew out all that 'be
           an individual, assert yourself'
           crap anymore.

She heads out, very upset.

INT.  DRUG STORE

another and another. All told, the store is completely jam packed with 
over a hundred boys, all standing in line, all buying condoms.

CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM

Sandy is getting ready to go to the party, making herself look as hot as 
possible, and she looks hot. There's a knock on the door. She's scared to 
answer it, considering how she's dressed. Her dad comes in and sits on the 
bed. Sandy turns away from and buttons her top shirt button up.

                    DAD
              I know where you're going.

                     SANDY
                  (concerned)
              
              You do?

                     DAD
              Your brother told us.

                    SANDY
              Daddy....

                    DAD
             Shh. I'm not going to tell
             you not to go.

                    SANDY
             You're not?

                   DAD
             No. I couldn't do that.
             I have something for you.

He places something on her dresser, smiles at her, and leaves.

She looks at what he's left. It's a condom.

                  ANDY

            There's Jan and Heather.
            Let's grab them quick before
            someone else does.

                NERD 2
            Ok.

                NERD 1
            Hide your laptop here.

                 NERD 2
            No.

                NERD 1
           You can't bring it.

                NERD 2
           I'm not leaving it here.

Nerd 2 heads toward the girls, taking his laptop. Nerd 1 follows, pissed 
off. They walk up near the homely girls and make eye contact. After 
several uncomfortable moments, someone shouts for an upper window.

                GIRL IN WINDOW
           Marisa! Find someone fast.
           Floor space is almost gone.

This only heightens the uncomfortable ness outside. One of the homely 
girls looks at the laptop.

           minutes of beasting?

                 CINDY
           Don't flatter yourself.
           You'll be lucky to last

Jody rides down the street, just pedaling fast, as fast as she can.
She's in her own world, very upset.

A car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesn't slow 
down, knowing the light is about to change.

A boy in a passing car whistles at Jody, waking her out of her stupor.  
Jody looks up just as the light turns red. She hits her brakes and skids 
into the tail of the oncoming car. She glances off it and goes sliding off 
the road, into a few garbage cans.

The car nicks another car and pulls over.

Across the street, we see that the Killer's IMPERIAL is stopped at the red 
light.

Jody gets up, shaken. He knees and elbows are badly scratched.

The OWNER of the car comes running over to Jody.

                 OWNER
            Are you O.K.?

                  JODY
            I'm ok.

                 CAR OWNER
            Are you sure?

                   JODY
            Yes.

                  LEONARD(O.C.)
           You don't look OK.

Jody turns around. Her teacher Leonard Marliston is there. The killer's 
IMPERIAL is parked behind him. Jody wipes away the tears.

                  JODY
              (starting to cry)
           I am.

                LEONARD
           My house is just a couple of blocks
           away. Why don't you come on over and
           clean those cuts up.

                JODY
           Ok. Should I put my bike in the back
           of your car?

                LEONARD
           Can you just follow me?
           The back is full?

                 JODY
           Sure.

CUT TO:

EXT.  PARTY HOUSE

Kids are still arriving from all over but there's no more room in the 
house so the party starts spilling out into the backyard.

One couple spreads out on the roof.

A cop car has pulled up in front and the deputy is just keeping a watch on 
the house.
          
EXT.  TOWN SQUARE

Kids are starting to gather and hook up in the town square. As the police 
try to break up one gathering, another one starts.

CUT TO:

INT.  CAR

Leonard drives down the road. He smiles into his rear view mirror.

EXT.  STREET

In Leonard's rear view mirror we see Jody pedaling behind him.

A couple of boys lean out of their cars and invite Jody to the go to the 
party. Sirens scream out in the distance.

EXT.  LEONARD'S HOUSE

Leonard pulls into his driveway. Jody pulls in behind. She leans the bike 
on the front porch and they head into the house.

                  LEONARD
            You aren't going to the party?

                  JODY
            You know about that too?

INT.  LEONARD'S HOUSE

Mr. Leonard opens the door to his house. Jody walks in behind him.

     
                  LEONARD
            of COURSE. You're not scared?

                  JODY
            Of course I'm scared.

                  LEONARD
            Then you should go.

                  JODY
            You think I should go to
            the party, Mr. Marliston?

                  LEONARD
            I really do. For your own
            safety.

Jody doesn't know what to make of this. It's not what she expected to hear 
from her teacher.

Leonard goes into the kitchen. Jody sits on the couch and looks around. 
She's immediately sensing that something is off about the place. It's 
certainly not the way she imagined a teacher's house to look. It has all 
sorts of city plans, maps, and drawings on the walls. Years of Cherry 
Falls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles.

He reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water. He hands 
her a beer.

                  JODY
            I just feel so manipulated.
            By everyone. My dad, my boyfriend,
            and now some psychopath I don't
            even know.

SHE TAKES THE BEER, surprised he's giving her alcohol. He kneels down in 
front of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg.

                  LEONARD
            We're all manipulated. From the moment
            we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped
            my life happened before I was even born.

                  JODY
            Really?

                  LEONARD
            Yes. We have no real freedom.
            You of all people should understand
            that. This may sting.

Jody is beginning to feel strange. There's something off kilter about this 
whole encounter.

                  JODY
            Me? Why me?

                  LEONARD
             Because of your father.
            The way what his sins shaped you.

He starts putting a disinfectant on her wound.

                  JODY
            What do you know about my father?

                  LEONARD
            He's a rapist. Like mine.

She grimaces. The disinfectant hurts.

                  JODY
                (a little scared)_
            Your father raped someone?

                  LEONARD
            Lisa Sherman was my mother.
            Do you know who that is?

                   JODY
            Yes.

                  LEONARD
           I was born nine months after she was
           raped. One of the four men who raped
           her is my father. I have no idea which one.

                  JODY
           You're the killed.

                 LEONARD
           Yes that's the whole point. This is
           what I was put on this earth to do.
           Rape the town that raped my mother.
           Steal its pristine innocence like it
           stole hers. I've planned this since I was
           a very little boy. You have no real freedom
           either. Your father has cast a shadow that
           you've never eluded.

Jody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly. He's 
not letting her get away.

Jody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it.

Leonard grabs her and throws her across the room.

Jody smashes into a  table. He bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a 
book case over on him, narrowly escaping.

She runs for the back door.

INT.  BACK DOOR

Jody opens the back door and gets halfway out when Leonard runs up to her, 
pulls her away from the door, and slugs her in the face, sending her 
sprawling to the ground. He picks her up and punches her a second time, 
breaking her nose, knocking her half out. He picks her up by the waist and 
carries her to the basement stairs.

INT.  BASEMENT STAIRS

Leonard throws Jody down into the dark basement. She tumbles down the 
stairs, hitting her head on the cold stone floor.

He comes charging down after her, closing the door behind them.

CUT TO:

INT.  PARTY HOUSE

The CD is now skipping. Kids are in every corner, bed , and closet, making 
out. Every square inch of the house is being taken as the party shifts 
into higher gear. It's a sea of sheets and blankets rippling with bodies 
under them. Giggles and moans are heard every second.

INT.  A CLOSET

Sandy and Mark are gently kissing in the closet, still standing up. Mark 
studies Sandy's face for a second, then slowly lifts her dress, sliding 
his hand on to her thighs.

                    MARK
             You're so beautiful.

                   SANDY
            So are you.

                   MARK
            Now don't be nervous.

                   SANDY
            You're the one who's hand is shaking.

Mark smiles, embarrassed. They kiss. They're falling in love.

ECU - ELECTRONIC beeps come off a computer screen as a warrior armed with 
a huge plasma gun fights his way into a dark cave, shooting plasma 
everywhere.

The nerds and the homely girls are in the corner playing the computer 
game, ALL SCARED TO MAKE a move. People around them are shushing them as 
they blow up monster. One guy finally has had it. H gets up, grabs the 
laptop and tosses it out the window. NERD 2 IS PISSED OFF.

                  NERD 2
            Hey! That was a 3k machine.

                  NERD 1
            Told you to hide it.

Homely girl 2 starts to laugh. It was kind of funny. Then they all start 
to laugh, even NERD 2. There's nothing left to do but laugh. Except kiss. 
And that they do.

INT.  BEDROOM

Cindy and Ben are naked under a blanket in the corner.

                  BEN
             One more time.

                  CINDY
                (negotiating)
             I get the imports.

                  BEN
             Ok!

He's all over her. She's into it too.

INT.  BEDROOM

Sharon turns up the heat on Kenny, running her hands across his bare 
chest. Kenny breaks off the kiss, not really into it.

                  SHARON
             You ok?

                  KENNY
            Just thinking about something.

                   SHARON
            What?

                  KENNY
            There's going to be very few
            virgins left in school on Monday.
            It could be really dangerous for them
            if the killer isn't caught.

                 SHARON
            I guess so. Luckily we won't have
            that problem.

She kisses him again. He stops her again, buttons his shirt.

                 SHARON
            What are you doing?

                 KENNY
            I got to go.

                 SHARON
            What?

                 KENNY
            I'm worried about someone.

He puts his clothes on.

                 SHARON
             You can't just leave me here.

                 BOY'S VOICE
            Stay put Sharon. I'll hop on over
            when I'm done here.

                GIRL'S VOICE
            You will not!

Others laugh. Kenny looks around.

                 KENNY
            Jody was right, this party IS sick.

Kenny buttons his shirt and heads out. Sharon is pissed.

CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT               

As Jody comes to, she finds herself gagged, tied to a chair in the dark 
basement. She can't see much but she can hear the sounds of water dripping 
and a rat scurrying around. She tips her chair over and falls onto the 
cold floor. She tries to removes her gag by rubbing her head against the 
ground.

EXT.  LEONARD'S HOUSE

Leonard goes to his station wagon and opens the back.

INT.   CAR

A body is hidden under a blanket. Leonard picks it up. It's too heavy.

INT.   BASEMENT

Jody can't undo her gag but she notices a piece of glass under a dresser. 
She turns herself around to grab for it.

She squeezes her hand under the dresser, reaching for the shard.

The door at the top of the stairs opens.

Leonard appears in silhouette carrying the body wrapped in a blanket. He 
throws it down the stairs and turns the lights on.

The basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his 
mother's house. A cot in the same spot. The dresser as well. The Lisa 
Sherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks.

Leonard sits Jody back up.

A little blood drips from Jody's closed hands. She has the shard.

Leonard ties the other body to a chair facing Jody. He starts singing SLY 
AND THE FAMILY STONE.

                  LEONARD
                (singing)
             'It's a family affair,
             It's a family affair.'

He undoes the blanket revealing the battered but still breathing body of 
Jody's dad. Brent's bleeding from the forehead, nose, and mouth. He's 
badly beaten up.

Jody gags on her gag. Her dad looks her in the eye.

                   LEONARD
             Well, we may be family
             One in four chance.

Leonard picks up his razor and starts towards Jody.

                   LEONARD
             Sheriff Brent, you will be the
             second of the four horsemen of
             the apocalypse to die. But first you
             will watch as I slice up your little
             girl.

Brent starts frantically shaking no, trying to escape as Leonard kneels in 
front of Jody and runs his hands up under her dress, exposing her shaved, 
nubile leg. The 'V' is still fresh in her calf.

Leonard starts to cut an 'I' next to it.

Jody's face grimaces in pain. Blood drips to the ground. Her leg starts to 
shake.          

                    LEONARD
           You're shaking too much.
           If you don't stop shaking Jody,
           I'll have to kill before I carve.
           We wouldn't want that.

Jody concentrates on trying to show no pain, not to flinch. It's tough. 
Her father watches, 
horrified.

Cut to:

EXT.  STREET

Kenny runs down the street, heading toward Jody's house. He stops to catch 
his breath for a second.
He notices something.

EXT.  LEONARD'S

Jody's bicycle is still leaning against Leonard's porch.

EXT.  STREET

Kenny crosses the street to Leonard's house and inspects the bicycle. It's 
hers.

INT.  BASEMENT

Leonard continues to work on Jody's bare leg, starting the 'R'. Jody and 
her father stare at each other, helplessly.

                  LEONARD
           My mother said, after you and your
           three droogs raped her Brent, that people
           in town refused to let her use their bathrooms.
           Is that true? Did people really call her a slut
           and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to
           snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least
           in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me, 
           she saw only you.

Jody gags in pain. Brent looks away.

                   LEONARD
            Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or
            will I cause her much more pain.

Brent opens his eyes. More blood drips. Jody starts to lose consciousness, 
barely able to stand it 
anymore. The doorbell rings. Leonard looks up, concerned.

EXT.  HOUSE

Kenny rings it again. No one answers.

He walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the 
curtains.

INT.  HOUSE

Kenny's POV - Jody's coat and purse are still on the couch.

EXT.  HOUSE

Kenny senses that something is really off. He rings again but no one 
answers.  Worried, he pops the screen. It's breaking and entering time.

INT.  LIVING ROOM

Kenny climbs into the living room and looks around.

                    KENNY
              Hello? Jody?

INT.   BASEMENT

Leonard hears Kenny. He can't ignore him any longer.

                     LEONARD
             Who the fuck is breaking into my house?

Leonard checks Jody's and Brent's ropes are tight, then heads up the 
stairs. As soon as he disappears, Jody wriggles toward her father and 
starts cutting his ropes with the shard of glass.

INT.    HOUSE

Leonard comes out of the basement and peers into the living room.

INT.    LIVING ROOM

Leonard sees Kenny opening Jody's purse, checking it out.

Leonard keeps the razor hidden behind his back.

                       LEONARD
              My wallet's on the mantle
              when you've finished your rifling,
              Kenny.

Kenny looks up, startled.

                       KENNY
                   (nervously)
              Oh, hey Mr. Marliston. W-What's Jody's
              bike doing on your front porch?

                       LEONARD
             That all depends Kenny. Depends on why
             the FUCK you've broken into your history
             teacher's house?

                      KENNY
            Alright, Marliston, I know she's here.
            
                       LEONARD
            What are you talking about? No one here
            but us chickens.

INT.  BASEMENT 

Jody cuts through her dad's ropes. Her dad immediately takes Jody's gag 
off.

INT.  LIVING ROOM

Kenny heads out the door.

                      JODY(O.C.)
             Help!

Kenny hears the cry and turns around.

                      KENNY
             That was Jody!

Leonard says nothing. He just stares at Kenny.

                      JODY(O.C.)
             Somebody help!

Kenny heads toward the basement door to investigate. Brent starts kicking 
on the other side of the locked door.

                      KENNY
              Jody?!

Leonard moves towards Kenny with the razor. Kenny turns just in time.  He 
grabs Leonard's arm as Leonard tries to slit his throat. They struggle.

The door lock starts to shake as Brent continues to kick the door open 
from the other side.

Leonard picks up a  lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the 
head. Kenny falls to the ground.

The door pops open. Brent charges out. Leonard turns to him and slashes 
him across the chest as Brent sprays red paint in Leonard's eyes. Leonard 
screams, and lunges at Brent.

Brent grabs Leonard. Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard 
down the basement stairs.

Leonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs. The two roll to the 
bottom, smashing their heads along the way. As they come to a stop, Brent 
smashes his head hard on the floor. Leonard ends up on top of him. He 
raises the razor and slits Brent across the face.

                    BRENT
               Jody run!

Jody crawls up the stairs, dragging her bad leg.

Instinctually, Brent hangs on to Leonard, as Leonard tries to get to Jody. 
Leonard slashes Brent across the face again.

                      JODY
               No!

                      BRENT
                   (dying)
              Run!

Jody crawls to the top of the stairs.  Leonard does everything he can to 
get away from Brent but Brent hangs on.  Jody watches, horrified, at the 
top of the stair. Kenny appears at the top of the stairs and pulls Jody 
away from the gruesome sight as Leonard continues to slash Brent's body 
open. Brent rolls over, a bloody mess.

INT.  TOP OF STAIRS

Kenny slams the door shut as Leonard charges up the stairs. Kenny holds 
the door shut with all his might.

                    JODY
               My dad's down there!

                     KENNY
              He's dead! We've got to
              get the fuck out of here!

Kenny pushes a dresser in front of it, trapping Leonard.

                     JODY
              I can't walk. I think he cut right
              through a tendon.

Leonard starts chopping through the door with an axe.

Kenny helps Jody out the front door.

EXT.  HOUSE

Jody and Kenny limp out of the house. Kenny grabs Jody's bike.

                     KENNY

hangs on for dear life.

                  JODY
             Go to the police station!

                  KENNY
             Deputy Webber's at the party.
             It's only three blocks away.

Leonard's car squeals around the corner behind them.

                   JODY
              Fuck! It's him.

INT.  CAR

Leonard steps on the gas.

EXT.  STREET

Kenny peddles as fast as he can, going up onto the sidewalk but that 
doesn't stop Leonard. He comes screeching up on the sidewalk right behind 
Kenny, ready to run him over.

Kenny tears up onto a lawn, Leonard follows him, grass spewing up 
everywhere.

Kenny cuts hard between two trees and back onto the street. He heads onto 
the other sidewalk. LEONARD remains in pursuit, knocking into several 
cars, flattening several fences, and mutilating a cat along the way.

Leonard gains on them as they zigzag up and down the pristine street, 
destroying it.

Leonard pulls up right behind them. He hits the gas. Kenny has to turn 
hard to avoid getting hit.

Kenny can't hold the bike upright and it slides out from under them.

EXT.  BACKYARD

Kenny and Jody tumble up someone's driveway, smashing into their fence.

EXT.  STREET

Leonard can't hold the car straight and it 360s across several lawns. 
Finally stopping, smashing into a parked car.

EXT.   BACKYARD

Kenny helps Jody to her feet.

BACK OF HOUSE

The GERMAN SHEPARD that lives in the house comes charging out of the dog 
door towards them, barking and snarling.

                      KENNY
                 Shit.

Kenny helps Jody over the fence, then leaps up on it just as the German 
Shepard snaps at
him.

He jumps down on the other side, safe.

The German Shepard smells something else and tears away.

EXT.  FRONT OF HOUSE

Leonard gets out of his car and takes a step toward the house when the 
German Shepard comes charging out the open fence.  Leonard screams. The 
dog pounces on him, starts humping his leg. Leonard rolls his eyes. The 
dog thrusts away.

CLOSE ON THE RAZOR. Leonard raises the razor, contemplates, then rolls his 
eyes. He pushes the dog off of him.  It lets out a panted growl, almost 
like it's saying 'going so soon lover boy?' Leonard hops back in his car, 
speeds off down the street. The dog barks wildly up at the night sky. Talk 
about being left with a hard-on.

EXT.  PARTY HOUSE

The house is dark. The lights are all out.

EXT.   ROAD

The deputy checks his watch. A policeman comes running up.

                     POLICEMAN
                 We just found another body.

                     DEPUTY
                Who's?

                     POLICEMAN
                Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school.
                 Two kids went into his office to fuck and
                they found him, with his tongue cut out and
                his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also
                chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his
                pencil holder.

                    DEPUTY
                 Jesus. Any word from Brent?

                     POLICEMAN
               Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown.
                Kids from other towns are starting to congregate
                in the parks and at the high school. It's turning
               into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.

                    DEPUTY
               Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What
                he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.

                    POLICEMAN
               Ok.

The deputy jumps into his car.

                     DEPUTY
                Don't leave this party until you
                hear from me.

The policeman looks up at the house.

                     POLICEMAN
               But I shouldn't shut it down?

                     DEPUTY
               No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn
               party I've ever seen.

EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET

Jody and Kenny climb over a fence into another backyard. Jody is limping 
badly.
Kenny is helping her along.

                     JODY
               Thanks for coming back for me.

                     KENNY
               I love you.

She kisses him. He kisses her back.

INT.   CAR

Leonard has pulled over down the street from the party.

EXT.   STREET

Kenny and Jody appear from a backyard, across the street from the party.

INT.   POLICE CAR

The officer sits in his car, trying to call Brent.

                      OFFICER
                 Brent?
                     (no answer)
                 Come in Brent.

There's a knock at the car window. The officer looks up, startled.

EXT.   CAR

Leonard is looking in the window.

INT.   CAR

The officer rolls down the window.

                       OFFICER
                 Jesus Christ had balls in his soup,
                 Marliston, what'd you do, eat out a
                 pizza or something? What the fuck 
                 happened to your face?

                       LEONARD
                 Hey, look, Elvis.

                       OFFICER
                 Where?

                       LEONARD
                 You really are a god damn rube.

Leonard slashes the officer's throat open in one savage swoop. He slumps 
over the steering wheel, throat cut beyond repair, blood squirting 
everywhere.

                       LEONARD
                     (humming)
                'Family affair. Oh yes it's a 
                 family affair'.

EXT.  PARTY

Jody and Kenny limp up to the party. There are no police outside.

                        JODY
                 Where are the police?

Jody looks down the road, lets out a blood curdling scream. LEONARD is 
slowly limping towards the house, gore dripping razor in hands.
     
                        JODY
                 Oh GOD IT'S HIM!

                        KENNY
                 Quick! In the house. He
                 won't look for us in there.

Kenny and Jody limp toward the front door.

INT.  PARTY HOUSE

Kenny and Jody limp through the front door. Couples are everywhere. 
There's no room
to even walk.

The party has reached it's 'climax'.

We see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity. 
They run the gamut of emotions. Some are terrified, some are ecstatic. 
Some are concentrating as hard as they've ever concentrated, some are 
closing their eyes, trying to fade out.

We see Sandy, Mark, Cindy, and Ben all having a blast. Sharon has managed 
to find a new partner and the nerds are riding the homely girls. It's 
orgiastic.

Kenny and Jody can only marvel at it as they limp through the maze of 
bodies looking for a place to hide.

KENNY GRABS  a sheet off the ground and carries Jody up the stairs.

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM

Kenny carries Jody into the huge bedroom.

A couple of kids look up as the door opens. There must be over a 100 
teenagers in the room, adjoining bathroom, and closets. The room is just a 
sea of kids humping two deep, under blankets.

                     KID ON FLOOR
                 There's no room in here.
     
                     ANOTHER KID
                 Yeah. Get lost we're packed.

Kenny pays no attention to them. He shoves his way into a corner,  pissing 
off everyone on the way, stepping on a few hands and other appendages. He 
puts Jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt.

                      JODY
                    (whispering)
                 What are you doing?

                      KENNY
                 Pretend we're just another couple.

He pulls her under the sheet.

INT.  PARTY - DOWNSTAIRS

Leonard comes in the front door, his razor in hand, the policeman's blood 
still dripping from it. He looks around, wondering if they're here.

No one seems to notice Leonard as he hunts for Jody and Kenny, walking 
through the sea of bodies, dripping blood on the backs of a couple of 
kids. A serial killer at a fuckfest.  Leonard smiles at the sight of all 
the teenagers copulating.

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM

Kenny and Jody curl up next to each other. Kenny kisses her. She kisses 
him back.

They're into each other. They can't keep their hands off each other. They 
start to really make out.

INT.   PARTY DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM

Leonard moves into one of the bedrooms. He switches the lights on.

The kids look up pissed off. There's not an inch of floor space.

                     BOY
                Hey! Turn that off.

                     GIRL
                Mr. Marliston?!

                     LEONARD
                Hi Samantha. Excuse me.

He steps over a thrusting hairy ass, surveys the room.  No Kenny. No Jody.

                     GIRL
                    (freaked)
                What are you doing here?!

The girl breaks into orgasm before she can barely finish the sentence. 
Leonard
flips the lights off and heads out of the room. Through out the entire 
proceedings, everyone was fucking like no one entered the room. 
Homeostasis remains stable.

INT.  PARTY STAIRCASE

Leonard heads up the stairs, still looking for Kenny and Jody. A couple of 
kids
on the staircase notice him. He almost trips on one. They start whispering 
to each other, freaked out that a teacher is there. More and more kids 
start looking up The party has definitely been disturbed.

INT.   MASTER BEDROOM

Jody hears the disturbance. She stops Kenny and listens.

INT.   BEDROOM

Leonard checks another bedroom. He flips the lights on. No Jody, no Kenny. 
He leaves. More and more kids notice him.

INT.   MASTER BEDROOM

Jody and Kenny know he's close. Leonard appears in the doorway.

                      KENNY
                    (whispering)
                  It's him.

Leonard accidentally steps on a boy's hand as he enters the room. The boy, 
JIMMY, is pissed off.  He looks up and realizes who it is.

                      LEONARD
                 Pay no attention to me.

                      JIMMY
                 What are you doing here?

                      BOY ACROSS THE ROOM
                 He's looking to get laid.

                      JIMMY'S GIRLFRIEND
                Mr. Marliston?

She grabs her clothes, embarrassed. Jimmy gets up. He's very drunk. Kenny 
and Jody peek out from under their sheet.

                       JIMMY
                 You fucked me up!

                       LEONARD
                 What?

                       JIMMY
                 You gave me a 'D'.

                       LEONARD
                 I'm sure you should have failed.

                       JIMMY
                 I was grounded for two fucking
                 months because of you!

Jody knows her friend is in danger.

                       JODY
                 Jimmy leave him alone! He's
                 imbalanced.

Leonard sees Jody. He starts toward her but Jimmy stupidly jumps in his 
way.

                      LEONARD
                 Please get out of my way
                 or I'll have to hurt you.

                      JIMMY
                 I knew you were a pervert.
                 Always wearing those fucking doofy     
                 glasses, and driving a station wagon.

                      JODY
                 He's dangerous Jimmy!

                      JIMMY
                 So am I! I'm gonna rip your cock off
                  Marliston!

                      LEONARD
                 Touché'

Leonard winds back, slashes at Jimmy, lopping off his dick. Blood flies 
up, splatters across Jimmy's face. Jimmy screams. Leonard slashes open his 
neck. Blood splatters everywhere, on kid's backs, faces, butts.

His girlfriend screams as Jimmy falls to the ground, dying.

Leonard begins to panic. So do the kids. Leonard sees Jody across the room 
and starts toward her as the other kids in the room rise to their feet and 
stampede the fuck out of dodge like a herd of frightened elephants.

INT.  DIFFERENT BEDROOM

Kids in other rooms hear the commotion and break their embraces.

                    BOY(O.C.)
                Run! Mr. Marliston's here!
                And he's horny!

Panic sweeps through the whole party. Everyone wants out.

INT.  BEDROOM

Leonard can't get to Jody because too many kids are trying to get out the 
bedroom door, pushing toward it, sweeping him up in their flow. It has 
turned quickly into chaos with a teenage logjam at the door.

Leonard keeps his eyes pinned on Jody across the room, through the bodies. 
He can't make headway so he raises the razor to slash way to her. Jody 
sees him raise the razor.

                     JODY
                 No!

Leonard starts slashing his way toward Jody. He slashes a girl across the 
stomach, a boy across the face, a  girl across the breasts. It's a 
bloodbath, everyone's screaming.

KIDS' bodies fall to the ground, tripping people, creating even more 
chaos.

Leonard loses his balance and is pushed to the ground as kids stampede 
over him.

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM

Jody and Kenny try to make it to the door.

Leonard tries to get up but he can't. He starts crawling toward Jody, 
slashing the legs of a couple of kids who are in his way, sending them to 
the ground. One kid does a back flip through a glass coffee table, 
exploding it, sending a shard of glass out his throat. Blood sprays across 
the ceiling like a lawn sprinkler.

Through the sea of legs, Leonard sees Jody's leg, the 'VIR' still freshly 
carved. He slashes his way towards Jody.

EXT.   HOUSE

Half naked kids come streaming out of the house, it's a bizarre sight. 
Some of them stop and scream, noticing the deputy (his body has been hung 
upside down from a telephone pole, and disemboweled). The house is almost 
bursting as kids climb out the windows and appear from the back.

INT.   STAIRWELL

Too many kids are trying to get out at one. The staircase and all the 
hallways start totally backed up but all the kids keep pushing forward. 
Something's got to give.

INT.   BEDROOM

Leonard keeps crawling toward Jody, getting closer and closer. He 
scrunches over Jimmy's severed penis, staining his khakis with gore.

                      LEONARD
                 Come on! These are eighty dollar
                 INDEPENDENT khakis! Limited Edition!     
                 God damn it!

INT.   STAIRWELL

The pushing continues. There's nowhere to go. A boy gets pushed over the 
balcony, falling to the ground below.

INT.   BEDROOM

Leonard is just a few feet from Jody's leg.

Jody and Kenny push closer to the door.

Leonard reaches for Jody's leg. He can't quite grab it.

Kenny and Jody reach the door. They're almost out. Leonard lungs and grabs
Jody's leg.

Jody screams out in pain, falls into the crowd.

                      JODY
                   Kenny!

Kenny tries to grab for her but he can't reach her. The force of the mob 
pushes him out the door, through the vortex.

INT.  UPSTAIRS

Kids jam the staircase. There's too many trying to get down at once. 
Everyone's
still pushing. The kids on the staircase can't keep their position and 
start falling forward, pushing harder.

INT.  BEDROOM

Leonard keeps hold of Jody's leg and pulls her toward him.

EXT.  BALCONEY

Kenny tries to get back to Jody but there's no way he can make headway 
back into that room.

                       KENNY
                    Jody?!

The staircase is now jammed with people, starts to buckle.

The banister breaks. Kids start falling off the balcony and staircase, 
onto kids below, CRACKING SKULLS, breaking bones.

INT.   DOWNSTAIRS

Lamps smash to the ground. Tables are trampled. Basically, the entire 
inside of the house is destroyed in the stampede which puts something out 
of fucking JUMANJI to shame.

INT.   BEDROOM

Leonard gets hold of Jody's waist and pulls her towards him, razor ready.

INT.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR

Everyone gives one final push out. Kenny is swept on to the staircase. It 
can't take the pressure and finally cracks.

Kids tumble on top of each other falling to the floor below as the 
staircase splinters. Hurt kids are everywhere as more and more get pushed 
over the edge. It's a disaster. Broken boned teenagers litter the floor 
like it were a battlefield.

Kenny manages to grab hold of the second floor as kids fall past him.

The whole house begins to buckle.

INT.   BEDROOM

The room empties as the kids push out. Leonard pulls Jody up next to him 
and puts the razor to her neck. He draws the first spot of blood.

                      JODY
                Please! You wouldn't kill your
                sister, would you?

                     LEONARD
                You think you're my sister?

INT.   STAIRCASE

Kenny manages to pull himself back up to the second floor.

INT.   BEDROOM

Jody turns to look at LEONARD as Kenny appears in the doorway.

                      JODY
                 We have the same color eyes.

He looks into her eyes.

                      LEONARD
                 You're right. We do.

Leonard stares at Jody for a moment, relaxing his grip, giving Kenny just 
the break he needs to dive for Leonard's arm, surprising him, knocking him 
over. They struggle for the razor but Leonard overpowers him and grabs it, 
cutting his own hand. He turns and slices Kenny down the side, cutting him 
deep.

Kenny fights off the pain and leaps on Leonard's back, grabbing his arm 
around the neck.

Leonard stands up and twirls around, trying to knock Kenny off his back, 
smashing him into walls.

Kenny screams in pain, but doesn't let go, pulling at Leonard's face and 
throat.

Leonard spins faster.

JODY struggles to her feet, holding her neck, still losing a little blood. 
Kenny's grips start to slip as Leonard reaches back, to slice him across 
the face and neck.

LEONARD, backs up towards the window, slips over a dildo. He screams, 
loses his grip on Kenny, goes crashing out the second story window.

EXT.  HOUSE

Leonard crashes to the ground below, landing on his back on the front 
steps.

INT.  BEDROOM

Jody looks out after him. He looks up to her. Their eyes meet.

EXT.  HOUSE

KIDS start circling Leonard.

Leonard gets to his knees, still holding the razor. They start taunting 
him.

                    BOY 1
                It's the freak!

The kids inch closer to Leonard.
          
                    GIRL 1
                He's still got the blade!

One kid kicks him. Leonard slashes at the kid, but misses. Another boy 
kicks the knife out of his hands. A third picks it up.

                    BOY 3
                Come on! It's fuck him up time!

One boy kicks Leonard in the face. Another kicks him in the ribs, another 
in the balls. Leonard tries to fight back for a second but slowly they all 
descend on him, taking turns kicking and beating the ever living shit out 
of him. It's a feeding frenzy.  He disappears under the angry mob of 
teenagers.

INT.  BEDROOM

Jody helps Kenny to his feet.

                     KENNY
                Come on. Lets get out of here.

EXT.  FRONT YARD

Police cars screech to a stop out front. The kids are all disappearing off 
down the street.

JODY AND KENNY emerge out the front door, look down at LEONARD, barely 
alive, lying at bloody mess at the base of the steps.
     
                      LEONARD
                J-Jody. P-please help me.
                Please.

Leonard spits up blood. Jody squeals. Kenny covers her eyes.

CLOSE on the BALCONY overhead. The railing breaks off and the balcony 
comes crashing down, falling on Leonard, killing him. Jody embraces Kenny 
tightly.

                      KENNY
                It's all over now.

dissolve to:

EXT.  AVON LAKE CEMETERY

Cemetery- Brent's coffin is in a grave. People are leaving the funeral.

Jody is with her Mom. They are the last ones there. They watch as the 
workers start to throw dirt on the coffin.

Jody takes her mom's hand in her own. They're close again.

Dissolve to:

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM -  A MONTH LATER

It's night. Jody is asleep.

EXT.  BEDROOM

Someone is in the shadows outside, climbing up to her bedroom window.

INT.  BEDROOM

Intruder's POV - Through the window, Jody is sound asleep in her bed, 
vulnerable.

The window opens. Someone steps in and moves quietly over to the edge of 
the bed. She wakes, startled. She looks up. IT'S KENNY.

                     KENNY
                  (smiling)
               I'm all out of patience.

He climbs in her bed and takes her. She lets him. She's into it.

A pair of eyes peer through the slates of Jody's closet door. Someone is 
hidden in her closet.

KILLER'S POV - Jody and Kenny are now in the middle of making love for the 
first time. It's getting hot.

                     JODY
               Oh God, this is the way it
               should be.

The closet door opens. The real LISA SHERMAN is there. Maybe she wasn't 
dead after all!

She starts toward Jody, raising a huge butcher knife over her head.

Jody sees her and screams.

The knife comes down toward the center of Kenny's back.

His face contorts as the knife enters his body. Jody screams as he coughs 
up blood all over her breasts.

He looks helplessly at Jody, dying as the knife comes down again.

But now it's her father who's doing the stabbing!

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 

Jody wakes up from her dream, startled and shaken. She looks next to 
herself in bed. Kenny is lying there asleep, smiling, probably dreaming of 
her. The window is open. He must have climbed in.

There is a little red spot on the sheet next to her.

She cuddles up next to him as the sun starts to rise outside.

Dissolve to:

EXT.  CHERRY FALLS

The entrance to the town. The hanging sign reads 'Entering Cherry Falls, 
Ohio'.

The beautiful town is now peaceful again. The crickets are chirping, the 
robins begin cooing. Suddenly a window comes up and the hanging sign 
begins to sway back and forth, almost on its own.

CUT TO BLACK

               FULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH Grainy but unmistakably a man and 
               woman making love. Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING 
               in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, 
               MORE compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.

                                     CURLY'S VOICE
                              (crying out)
                         Oh, no.

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE

               CURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over 
               GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his 
               breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes' 
               shiny desk top.

               Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at 
               it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite 
               the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a 
               cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on his desk.

               Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist 
               into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts 
               to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left 
               a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos 
               of several movie stars askew.

               Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He 
               is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually 
               bites into the blinds.

               Gittes doesn't move from his chair.

                                     GITTES
                         All right, enough is enough. You 
                         can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. 
                         I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.

               Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes 
               reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly 
               selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of 
               more expensive whiskeys.

               Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his 
               desk toward Curly.

                                     GITTES
                         Down the hatch.

               Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. 
               He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry 
               quietly.

                                     CURLY
                              (drinking, relaxing a 
                              little)
                         She's just no good.

                                     GITTES
                         What can I tell you, Kid? You're 
                         right. When you're right, you're 
                         right, and you're right.

                                     CURLY
                         Ain't worth thinking about.

               Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly.

                                     GITTES
                         You're absolutely right, I wouldn't 
                         give her another thought.

                                     CURLY
                              (pouring himself)
                         You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I 
                         know it's your job, but you're okay.

                                     GITTES
                              (settling back, 
                              breathing a little 
                              easier)
                         Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.

                                     CURLY
                         Thanks. You know something, Jake?

                                     GITTES
                         What's that, Curly?

                                     CURLY
                         I think I'll kill her.

               INT. DUFFY & WALSH'S OFFICE

               Noticeably less plush than Gitte's. A well-groomed, dark-
               haired WOMAN sits nervously between their two desks, fiddling 
               with the veil on her pillbox hat.

                                     WOMAN
                         I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to 
                         this personally.

                                     WALSH
                              (almost the manner of 
                              someone comforting 
                              the bereaved)
                         If you'll allow us to complete our 
                         preliminary questioning, by then 
                         he'll be free.

               There is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes' Office.

               Something made of glass shatters. The Woman grows more edgy.

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE  GITTES & CURLY

               Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring 
               contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over 
               him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of 
               perspiration on his desk.

                                     CURLY
                              (crying)
                         They don't kill a guy for that.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh they don't?

                                     CURLY
                         Not for your wife. That's the 
                         unwritten law.

               Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting;

                                     GITTES
                         I'll tell you the unwritten law, you 
                         dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be 
                         rich to kill somebody, anybody and 
                         get away with it. You think you got 
                         that kind of dough, you think you 
                         got that kind of class?

               Curly shrinks back a little.

                                     CURLY
                         ...No...

                                     GITTES
                         You bet your ass you don't. You can't 
                         even pay me off.

               This seems to upset Curly even more.

                                     CURLY
                         I'll pay the rest next trip. We only 
                         caught sixty ton of skipjack around 
                         San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, 
                         they don't pay you for skipjack the 
                         way they do for tuna or albacore.

                                     GITTES
                              (easing him out of 
                              his office)
                         Forget it. I only mention it to 
                         illustrate a point...

               INT. OFFICE RECEPTION

               He's now walking him past SOPHIE who pointedly averts her 
               gaze. He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be 
               read: "J. J. GITTES and Associates. DISCREET INVESTIGATION"

                                     GITTES
                         I don't want your last dime.

               He throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         What kind of guy do you think I am?

                                     CURLY
                         Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Call me Jake. Careful driving home, 
                         Curly.

               He shuts the door on him and the smile disappears.

               He shakes his head, starting to swear under his breath.

                                     SOPHIE
                         A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for you, 
                         with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

               Gittes nods, walks on in.

               INT. DUFFY AND WALSH'S OFFICE

               Walsh rises when Gittes enters.

                                     WALSH
                         Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. 
                         Gittes?

               Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic 
               smile.

                                     GITTES
                         How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Mr. Gittes...

                                     GITTES
                         Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be 
                         the problem?

               She holds her breath. The revelation isn't easy for her.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         My husband, I believe, is seeing 
                         another woman.

               Gittes looks mildly shocked. He turns for confirmation to 
               his two partners.

                                     GITTES
                              (gravely)
                         No, really?

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         I'm afraid so.

                                     GITTES
                         I am sorry.

               Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between 
               Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.

               Gittes gives him an irritated glance. Duffy stops chewing.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. 
                         Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These 
                         men are my operatives and at some 
                         point they're going to assist me. I 
                         can't do everything myself.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Of course not.

                                     GITTES
                         Now, what makes you certain he is 
                         involved with someone?

               Mrs. Mulwray hesitates. She seems uncommonly nervous at the 
               question.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         A wife can tell.

               Gittes sighs.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your 
                         husband?

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                              (shocked)
                         ...Yes of course.

                                     GITTES
                              (deliberately)
                         Then go home and forget about it.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         But...

                                     GITTES
                              (staring intently at 
                              her)
                         I'm sure he loves you, too. You know 
                         the expression, let sleeping dogs 
                         lie? You're better off not knowing.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                              (with some real anxiety)
                         But I have to know.

               Her intensity is genuine. Gittes looks to his two partners.

                                     GITTES
                         All right, what's your husband's 
                         first name?

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                              (visibly surprised)
                         Water and Power?

               Mrs. Mulwray nods, almost shyly. Gittes is now casually but 
               carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs. Mulwray's dress 
                her handbag, shoes, etc.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         He's the Chief Engineer.

                                     DUFFY
                              (a little eagerly)
                         Chief Engineer?

               Gittes' glance tells Duffy Gittes wants to do the questioning. 
               Mrs. Mulwray nods.

                                     GITTES
                              (confidentially)
                         This type of investigation can be 
                         hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. 
                         It takes time.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. 
                         Gittes.

               Gittes sighs.

                                     GITTES
                         Very well. We'll see what we can do.

               EXT. CITY HALL  MORNING

               Already shimmering with heat.

               A drunk blows his nose with his fingers into the fountain at 
               the foot of the steps.

               Gittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way up 
               the stairs.

               INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS

               Former Mayor SAM BAGBY is speaking. Behind him is a huge 
               map, with overleafs and bold lettering:

                        "PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR"

               Some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip 
               columns while Bagby is speaking.

                                     BAGBY
                         Gentlemen, today you can walk out 
                         that door, turn right, hop on a 
                         streetcar and in twenty-five minutes 
                         end up smack in the Pacific Ocean. 
                         Now you can swim in it, you can fish 
                         in it, you can sail in it but you 
                         can't drink it, you can't water your 
                         lawns with it, you can't irrigate an 
                         orange grove with it.  Remember we 
                         live next door to the ocean but we 
                         also live on the edge of the desert. 
                         Los Angeles is a desert community. 
                         Beneath this building, beneath every 
                         street there's a desert. Without 
                         water the dust will rise up and cover 
                         us as though we'd never existed!
                              (pausing, letting the 
                              implication sink in)

               CLOSE  GITTES

               sitting next to some grubby farmers, bored. He yawns, edges 
               away from one of the dirtier farmers.

                              (continuing)
                         The Alto Vallejo can save us from 
                         that, and I respectfully suggest 
                         that eight and a half million dollars 
                         is a fair price to pay to keep the 
                         desert from our streets and not on 
                         top of them.

               AUDIENCE  COUNCIL CHAMBERS

               An amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have 
               been listening with keen interest. A couple of the farmers 
               applaud.

               Somebody shooshes them.

               COUNCIL COMMITTEE

               In a whispered conference.

                                     COUNCILMAN
                              (acknowledging Bagby)
                         Mayor Bagby... let's hear from the 
                         departments again. I suppose we better 
                         take Water and Power first. Mr. 
                         Mulwray.

               REACTION  GITTES

               Looking up with interest from his racing form.

               MULWRAY

               Walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in 
               his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising 
               fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The 
               man turns the overleaf on the map.

                                     MULWRAY
                         In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, 
                         over five hundred lives were lost 
                         when the Van der Lip Dam gave way 
                         core samples have shown that beneath 
                         this bedrock is shale similar to the 
                         permeable shale in the Van der Lip 
                         disaster.  It couldn't withstand 
                         that kind of pressure there.
                              (referring to a new 
                              overleaf)
                         Now you propose yet another dirt 
                         banked terminus dam with slopes of 
                         two and one half to one, one hundred 
                         twelve feet high and a twelve thousand 
                         acre water surface. Well, it won't 
                         hold. I won't build it. It's that 
                         simple. I am not making that kind of 
                         mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.

               Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly 
               there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the 
               chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny, 
               bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion.

                                     COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                              (shouting to farmer)
                         What in the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?
                              (as the sheep bleat 
                              down the aisles toward 
                              the Council)
                         Get those goddam things out of here!

                                     FARMER
                              (right back)
                         Tell me where to take them! You don't 
                         have an answer for that so quick, do 
                         you?

               Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations 
               of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the 
               farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to 
               bodily attack Mulwray.

                                     FARMER
                              (through above, to 
                              Mulwray)
                         You steal the water from the valley, 
                         ruin the grazing, starve my livestock 
                         who's paying you to do that, Mr. 
                         Mulwray, that's what I want to know!

               L.A. RIVERBED  LONG SHOT

               It's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks. 
               Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked 
               with weeds.

               After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood 
               control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray 
               gets out of the car. Me looks around.

               WITH GITTES

               Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the 
               flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover. 
               He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of 
               the riverbed.

               There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at 
               the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.

               GITTES

               Trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's 
               glasses.

               BELOW GITTES

               There's the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping. 
               Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into 
               the riverbed, and into Gitte's view.

               MULWRAY

               Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power 
               lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water 
               at his feet.

               He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, 
               toward Gittes.

               GITTES

               Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in 
               the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the 
               muddy banks.

               Mulwray says something to the boy.

               The boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground. 
               The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud 
               and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it.

               After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly 
               back upstream  scrambling up the bank to his car.

               There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of 
               blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the 
               hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking 
               downstream from time to time.

               The power lines overhead HUM.

               He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets 
               back in the car. He drives off.

               GITTES

               Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right 
               back out.

               The steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back 
               seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in 
               and takes off.

               POINT FERMIN PARK  DUSK

               Street lights go on.

               MULWRAY

               Pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park 
               lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.

               GITTES

               Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in 
               the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through the trees 
               in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of 
               the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes 
               moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating 
               the climb than Mulwray did.

               DOWN ON THE BEACH

               Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear 
               crescent.

               He looks to his left. There's a promontory of sorts. It's 
               apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then 
               moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in 
               order to be above Mulwray.

               AT THE OUTFALL

               Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand.

               Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it. Looks 
               absently up toward Gittes.

               GITTES

               Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.

               BEACON LIGHT AT POINT FERMIN

               Flashing in the dust.

               CLOSE  GITTES

               Sitting, suddenly starts. He swears softly. He's in a puddle 
               of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.

               MULWRAY

               Below him in watching the water trickling down from the 
               outfall near Gittes.

               Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated. 
               Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and 
               velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading 
               into the sea, whipping it into a foam.

               AT THE STREET  GITTES' CAR

               There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper. 
               Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash 
               light. It says:

               "SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR 
               PROPERTY! LOS ANGELES IS YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE!!! 
               VOTE YES NOVEMBER 6... CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO SAVE OUR CITY, 
               HON. SAM BAGBY, FORMER MAYOR  CHAIRMAN." Gittes grumbles, 
               crumples it up and tosses it out the window. He notices other 
               flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street.

               Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment.

               INT. GLOVE COMPARTMENT

               Consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches.

               The cheap price tags are still on them. Gittes pulls out 
               one.

               He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch. 
               It's 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray's car and places it behind 
               the front wheel of Mulwray's car. He yawns again and heads 
               back to his own car.

               GITTES

               Arrives whistling, opens the door with "J.J. GITTES AND 
               ASSOCIATES  DISCREET INVESTIGATION" on it.

                                     GITTES
                         Morning, Sophie.

               Sophie hands him a small pile of messages. He goes through 
               them.

                                     GITTES
                         Walsh here?

                         He's in the dark room.

               Gittes walks through his office to Duffy and Walsh's. A little 
               red light is on in the corner, over a closed door. Gittes 
               walks over and knocks on the door.

                                     GITTES
                         Where'd he go yesterday?

                         water on the brain.

                         What'd you expect? That's his job.

                                     GITTES
                         Listen, we can't string this broad 
                         out indefinitely we got to come up 
                         with something.

                         I think I got something.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?

                         It's on your desk. Say, you hear the 
                         one about the guy who goes to the 
                         North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking 
                         for penguins?

               Gittes walks to his office.

               ON HIS DESK

               Is the Ingersoll watch, the crystal broken, the hands stopped 
               at 2:47.

                                     GITTES
                         He was there all night.

               Gittes drops it, sits down. Walsh comes in carrying a series 
               of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; eagerly)
                         So what you got?

               Walsh shows him the photos. He looks at them. They are a 
               series outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man 
               whose appearance is striking. In two of the photos a gnarled 
               cane is visible.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; obviously 
                              annoyed)
                         This?

                                     WALSH
                         They got into a terrific argument 
                         outside the Pig 'n Whistle.

                                     GITTES
                         What about?

                                     WALSH
                         I don't know. The traffic was pretty 
                         loud. I only heard one thing  apple 
                         core.

                                     GITTES
                         Apple core?

                                     WALSH
                              (shrugs)
                         Yeah.

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE

               Gittes tosses down the photos in disgust.

                                     GITTES
                         Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you 
                         spent your day doing?

                                     WALSH
                         Look, you tell me to take pictures, 
                         I take pictures.

                                     GITTES
                         Let me explain something to you, 
                         Walsh. This business requires a 
                         certain finesse.

               The PHONE has been RINGING. Sophie buzzes him.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, Sophie?
                              (he picks up the phone)
                         Duffy, where are you?

               Duffy's VOICE can be HEARD, excitedly. "I got it. I got it. 
               He's found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat, in 
               Echo Park."

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Okay, slow down  Echo Park.
                              (to Walsh)
                         Jesus, water again.

               WESTLAKE PARK (MCARTHUR PARK)

               Duffy is rowing, Gittes seated in the stern.

               They pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print 
               dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly doting on 
               the girl.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Duffy, as they 
                              pass)
                         Let's have a big smile, pal.

               He shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast 
               shots.

               Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them.

               DUFFY

               Turns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl, Gittes 
               again clicking off several fast shots.

               CLOSE SHOT  SIGN:

                                 "EL MACANDO APARTMENTS"

               MOVE ALONG the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of 
               the roof where Gittes' feet are hooked over the apex of the 
               roof and Gittes himself is stretched face downward on the 
               tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below 
               him where the girl and Mulwray are eating. Gittes is clicking 
               off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come 
               loose.

               Gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the 
               roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. He tries to 
               slow himself down. The loose tile also begins to slide.

               Gittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm drain 
               and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his 
               feet in the drain itself. The loose tile falls and hits the 
               veranda below. He stops as it's about to slide over the edge. 
               He carefully lays it in the drain. But a fragment off the 
               cracked edge of the tile falls.

               WITH MULWRAY AND THE GIRL

               Mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet. He looks to the 
               girl.

               He's clearly concerned. He rises, looks up to the roof.

               FROM HIS POV

               The roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. He slowly 
               sits back down, staring at the tile fragment.

               In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart-
               shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken. 
               Next to it is a smaller column, "J.J. Gittes hired by 
               suspicious spouse."

               Holds the paper and reads while getting his haircut and his 
               shoes shined. In fact, almost all the customers are reading 
               papers.

                              (to Gittes)
                         When you get so much publicity, after 
                         a while you must get blasé about it.

               A self-satisfied smile comes to Gittes' face.

                                     BARNEY
                              (continuing)
                         Face it. You're practically a movie 
                         star.

               In b.g., customers can be OVERHEARD talking about the drought.

               Interspersed with above, someone is saying, "They're gonna 
               start rationing water unless it rains." Someone else says, 
               "Only for washing your cars." Third says, "You're not going 
               to be able to water your lawn either, or take a bath more 
               than once a week." First says, "If you don't have a lawn or 
               a car, do you get an extra bath?"

               Gittes has been staring outside the barbershop. A car is 
               stalled.

               The hood is up. A man watches his radiator boiling over.

                                     GITTES
                              (laughing)
                         Look at that.

                         Fools names and fools faces...

               Gittes has heard the word. He straightens up.

                                     GITTES
                              (smiling; to Other 
                              Customer)
                         What's that, pal?

                              (indicating paper)
                         Nothing. You got a hell of a way to 
                         make a living.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?

               Gittes laughs.

                                     GITTES
                         Tell me, how many people a week do 
                         you foreclose on?

                                     OTHER CUSTOMER
                         We don't publish a record in the 
                         paper, I can tell you that.

                                     GITTES
                         Neither do I.

                                     OTHER CUSTOMER
                         No, you have a press agent do it.

               Gittes gets out of the chair. Barney, a little concerned, 
               tries to restrain him, holding onto the barber sheet around 
               Gittes' neck.

                                     GITTES
                         Barney, who is this bimbo? He a 
                         regular customer?

                                     BARNEY
                         Take it easy, Jake.

                                     GITTES
                         Look, pal. I make an honest living. 
                         People don't come to me unless they're 
                         miserable and I help 'em out of a 
                         bad situation. I don't kick them out 
                         of their homes like you jerks who 
                         work in the bank.

                                     BARNEY
                         Jake, for Christ's sake.

               Gittes is trying to take off his sheet.

                                     GITTES
                         C'mon, get out of the barber chair. 
                         We'll go outside and talk this over.

               The Customer is shrinking back into the chair.

                                     BARNEY
                         Hey, c'mon, Jake. Sit down. Sit down. 
                         You hear about the fella goes to his 
                         friend and says, 'What'll I do, I'm 
                         tired of screwing my wife?' and his 
                         friend says, 'Whyn't you do what the 
                         Chinese do?'

               Gittes allows himself to be tugged back to his chair.

                                     GITTES
                         I don't know how that got in the 
                         paper as a matter of fact  it 
                         surprised me it was so quick. I make 
                         an honest living.

                                     BARNEY
                         'Course you do, Jake.

                                     GITTES
                         An honest living.

                                     BARNEY
                              (continuing)
                         So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do 
                         what the Chinese do?'

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE

               Gittes comes bursting in, slapping a newspapers on his thigh.

                                     GITTES
                         Duffy, Walsh.

               Walsh comes out of his office, Duffy out of the other one.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Sophie, go to the little girl's room 
                         for a minute.

                                     SOPHIE
                         But, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (insisting)
                         Sophie.

                                     SOPHIE
                         Yes, Mr. Gittes.

               She gets up and leaves.

                                     GITTES
                         So there's this fella who's tired of 
                         screwing his wife.

                                     DUFFY
                         Jake, listen.

                                     GITTES
                         Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a 
                         hurry and his friend says why not do 
                         what the Chinese do? So he says what 
                         do they do? His friend says the 
                         Chinese they screw for a while. Just 
                         listen a second, Duffy...

               A stunning YOUNG WOMAN appears behind Gittes in his doorway. 
               She's shortly joined by a small, GRAY-HAIRED MAN. They listen, 
               unseen by Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         ...and then they stop and they read 
                         a little Confucius and they screw 
                         some more and they stop and they 
                         smoke some opium and then they go 
                         back and screw some more and they 
                         stop again and they contemplate the 
                         moon or something and it makes it 
                         more exciting. So this other guy 
                         goes home to screw his wife and after 
                         a while he stops and gets up and 
                         goes into the other room only he 
                         reads Life Magazine and he goes back 
                         and he screws some more and suddenly 
                         says excuse me a second and he gets 
                         up and smokes a cigarette and he 
                         goes back and by this time his wife 
                         is getting sore as hell. So he screws 
                         some more and then he gets up to 
                         look at the moon and his wife says, 
                         'What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?
                              (Gittes breaks up)
                         ...you're screwing like a Chinaman.'

               Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off. The 
               little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks up he sees 
               the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties. She's so 
               stunning that Gittes nearly gasps.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Mr. Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         Yes?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Do you know me?

                                     GITTES
                         Well... I think I... I would've 
                         remembered.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Have we ever met?

                                     GITTES
                         Well, no.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Never?

                                     GITTES
                         Never.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         That's what I thought. You see, I'm 
                         Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. 
                         Mulwray's wife.

               Gittes is staggered. He glances down at the newspaper.

                                     GITTES
                         Not that Mulwray?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And 
                         since you agree with me we've never 
                         met, you must also agree that I 
                         haven't hired you to do anything. 
                         Certainly not spy on my husband. I 
                         see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. 
                         Well, you're going to get it.

                                     GITTES
                         Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...

               She's walked past him toward the door. He stop her.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         ...there's some misunderstanding 
                         here. It's not going to do any good 
                         to get tough with me.

               Evelyn flashes a cold smile.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't get tough with anybody, Mr. 
                         Gittes.  My lawyer does.

               Evelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her. This 
               time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come 
               out of his office and up behind him.

                                     GRAY-HAIRED MAN
                         Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

               Gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons 
               and complaint. Evelyn walks out the door.

                                     GRAY-HAIRED MAN
                              (continuing; pleasantly)
                         I suppose we'll be hearing from your 
                         attorney.

               Gittes stares down at the papers in his hand.

               INT. GITTES' INNER OFFICE  GITTES, DUFFY & WALSH

               On Gittes' desk. There are empty coffee cups, the summons 
               and complaint, and the newspaper Gittes had brought with him 
               from the barber shop.

               The three men are sitting, worn and silent. Walsh chewing 
               gum is the loudest noise in the room.

               Gittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation. Walsh stops 
               chewing.

               Duffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the coffee 
               cups.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Duffy)
                         There's seven ashtrays in this room, 
                         Duffy.

                                     DUFFY
                         Okay.

                                     GITTES
                         That's a filthy habit.

                                     DUFFY
                         I said okay, Jake.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here 
                         saying she was Shirley Temple you'd 
                         say okay to that, too.

                                     WALSH
                         Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's 
                         real phone number and address.

                                     GITTES
                         All she needed for that was the phone 
                         book!

                                     WALSH
                         No, no. She said not to call, her 
                         husband might answer.

                                     GITTES
                         When I find out who that phony bitch 
                         was.

               Gittes is staring down at the newspaper. He suddenly grabs 
               the phone, begins dialing. A tight little smile breaks out 
               on his face.

               He buzzes Sophie.

                                     GITTES
                         Sophie.

                                     SOPHIE
                         Yes, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.
                              (as he waits)
                         And how about that snotty broad?
                              (the phone to his ear)
                         What does she think, she's perfect? 
                         Coming in waving her lawyers and her 
                         money at me  so goddam smug. She's 
                         no better than anybody else in this 
                         town.

               Sophie BUZZES.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Whitey, what's new, pal?... Yeah, 
                         listen, where did you get those 
                         photographs... Yeah, blowing a fuse 
                         over the El Macando love nest.  That's 
                         cute, Whitey... so who sent them to 
                         you... I sent them?
                              (Gittes laughs a little 
                              hysterically)
                         Why would I be asking how you got 
                         them if I sent them?... Whitey?... 
                         Whitey?... C'mon, level with me for 
                         once, my tit's in the wringer and 
                         it's beginning to hurt... yeah...  
                         yeah... yeah.

               He hangs up.

                                     WALSH
                         So he says you sent them?

                                     GITTES
                              (after a moment)
                         They're all a bunch of phonies.

               INT. DEPARTMENT WATER & POWER  HALL

               Gittes stops outside a door marked:

                            "HOLLIS J. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER"

               He enters an outer office. The SECRETARY looks surprised.

                                     GITTES
                         Mr. Mulwray, please.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He's not in, Mr.?

                                     GITTES
                         Gittes.

                                     SECRETARY
                         May I ask what this is regarding?

                                     GITTES
                         It's personal. Has he been out long?

                                     SECRETARY
                         Since lunch.

                                     GITTES
                         Gee whiz.
                              (he glances at his 
                              watch)
                         And I'm late.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He was expecting you?

                                     GITTES
                         Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go 
                         in and wait?

               Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half 
               rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door.

               MULWRAY'S INNER OFFICE

               The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray 
               at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas 
               and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted 
               photo of Evelyn in riding clothes.

               Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in 
               the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he 
               does.

               He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly 
               examining the top. He tries one of the drawers and it doesn't 
               open.

               He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens.

               He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it, riffles 
               through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. Drops it, 
               finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a 
               Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Then,

               He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray's neat 
               hand:

                      "Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used."

               Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent 
               pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the 
               drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's glasses 
               off the desk top when he does. He catches them, puts them on 
               the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.

               RUSS YELBURTON

               Enters the room. An anxious Secretary is right behind him.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Can I help you?
                              (extending his hand)
                         Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the 
                         Department.

                                     GITTES
                              (equally pleasant)
                         J.J. Gittes. And it's not a 
                         departmental matter.

                                     YELBURTON
                         I wonder if you'd care to wait in my 
                         office?

               This is more a request than an invitation. Gittes nods, 
               follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices 
               down the hall.

                                     YELBURTON
                              (continuing; as they're 
                              going)
                         You see, this whole business in the 
                         paper with Mr. Mulwray has us all on 
                         edge.

               INT. YELBURTON OFFICE

               Smaller than Mulwray's, he has most noticeably a lacquered 
               marlin mounted on the wall. There are a couple of other 
               pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other fish he's 
               standing beside.

               There's also a small burgee of a fish with the initials A.C. 
               below it, tacked onto the wall.

                                     YELBURTON
                         After all, you work with a man for a 
                         certain length of time, you come to 
                         know him, his habits, his values, 
                         and so forth. Well either he's the 
                         kind who chases after women or he 
                         isn't.

                                     GITTES
                         And Mulwray isn't?

                                     YELBURTON
                         He never even kids about it.

                                     GITTES
                         Maybe he takes it very seriously.

               Gittes winks. Yelburton chuckles appreciatively, loosening 
               up a little.

                                     GITTES
                         You don't happen to know where Mr. 
                         Mulwray's having lunch?

                                     YELBURTON
                         I'm sorry, I --

                                     GITTES
                         Well, tell him I'll be back.

               Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton's desk.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Mind if I take one of your cards?  
                         In case I want to get in touch with 
                         you again.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Help yourself.

               Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his 
               handkerchief pocket. He goes out the door, nearly running 
               into a man who is standing by the Secretary's desk, about 
               GITTES' age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in 
               a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper 
               bag.

                                     GITTES
                         Mulvihlll, what are you doing here?

               OUTER OFFICE  YELBURTON, MULVIHILL AND GITTES

               Mulvihill stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, remains by 
               the desk.

                                     MULVIHILL
                         They shut my water off, what's it to 
                         you?

                                     GITTES
                         How'd you find out? You don't drink 
                         it, you don't take a bath in it, 
                         maybe they sent you a letter. Ah, 
                         but then you'd have to be able to 
                         read.

               Mulvihill moves toward Gittes, shaking with fury. Yelburton 
               steps between them.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.
                              (to Yelburton)
                         Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?

                                     YELBURTON
                         Hope so. He's working for us.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOUSE  GITTES

               Rings the bell. He waits.

               A powerful CHINESE BUTLER with heavy hair and a half-jacket 
               of gold on one front tooth, answers the door.

                                     GITTES
                         J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

               He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet. The Butler 
               takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the 
               doorway.

               Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese GARDENER trim 
               a hedge. There's a SQUEAKING SOUND. Gittes moves a few feet 
               off the porch.

               POV  GARAGE

               A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a 
               chamois.

               Steam rises off the hood. The squeaking has obviously come 
               from the chamois.

               CHINESE BUTLER

               In doorway.

                                     CHINESE BUTLER
                         Please.

               Gittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing for 
               him to follow.

               THROUGH THE HOUSE  GITTES

               Follows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. A 
               maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some 
               French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with 
               running water.

                                     CHINESE BUTLER
                         You wait, please.

               Gittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very quiet 
               except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing. 
               After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles 
               at Gittes, probes into the pond.

               There's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes 
               it.

               After a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters 
               recede.

               EXT. POND  GITTES AND JAPANESE GARDENER  DAY

                                     GARDENER
                              (to Gittes)
                         Bad for glass.

                                     GITTES
                              (not understanding)
                         Yeah sure. Bad for glass.

               The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the 
               object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.

               He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks 
               it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the 
               gleaming object.

               He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the 
               trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto 
               it for poise.

               Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside 
               of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair.

               She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks 
               younger than she did in the office.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, Mr. Gittes?

               Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is annoyed 
               as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.

                                     GITTES
                         Actually, I'm here to see your 
                         husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

               He laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply. There 
               is none.

               The Chinese Butler appears on the veranda.

                                     EVELYN
                         Would you like something to drink?

                                     GITTES
                         What are you having?

                                     EVELYN
                         Iced tea.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. Fine, thank you.

               Chinese Butler nods, disappears

               EXT. POND AND GARDEN  MULWRAY HOUSE  DAY

               Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table. Gittes Joins her.

                                     EVELYN
                         My husband's at the office.

                                     GITTES
                         Actually he's not. And he's moved 
                         from his apartment at the El Macando.

                                     EVELYN
                              (sharply)
                         That's not his apartment.

                                     GITTES
                         Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be 
                         loved, but I am in business, and 
                         believe me, whoever set up your 
                         husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small 
                         town, people talk.

               He waits for a response. Then:

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; uneasily)
                         I'm just trying to make a living, 
                         and I don't want to become a local 
                         Joke.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into 
                         it. I'll drop the lawsuit.

                                     GITTES
                         What?

                                     EVELYN
                         I said I'll drop it.

               The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between 
               them.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing; pleasantly)
                         So let's just drop the whole thing. 
                         Sugar?  Lemon?

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     EVELYN
                              (as she's mixing one 
                              of the drinks)
                         Yes, Mr. Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         I don't want to drop it.

               Evelyn looks up. Gittes smiles a little sheepishly.

                                     GITTES
                         I should talk this over with your 
                         husband.

                                     EVELYN
                              (a little concerned)
                         Why?... What on earth for?  Look, 
                         Hollis seems to think you're an 
                         innocent man.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, I've been accused of many 
                         things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.

               Again he laughs a little nervously. Again no reaction.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         You see, somebody went to a lot of 
                         trouble here, and I want to find 
                         out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not 
                         the one who's supposed to be caught 
                         with my pants down... so I'd like to 
                         see your husband. Unless that's a 
                         problem.

                                     EVELYN
                              (with a slight edge)
                         What do you mean?

                                     GITTES
                         May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     EVELYN
                         You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (determined to be 
                              polite)
                         Well, that little girlfriend, she 
                         was attractive in a cheap sort of 
                         way of course.  She's disappeared. 
                         Maybe they disappeared together 
                         somewhere.

                                     EVELYN
                              (with rising anger)
                         Suppose they did. How does it concern 
                         you?

                                     GITTES
                         Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I 
                         just --

                                     EVELYN
                         It's very personal. It couldn't be 
                         more personal. Is this a business or 
                         an obsession with you?

                                     GITTES
                         Look at it this way. Now this phony 
                         broad, excuse the language, says 
                         she's you, she's hired me. Whoever 
                         put her up to it, didn't have anything 
                         against me. They were out to get 
                         your husband. Now if I see him, I 
                         can help him.  Did you talk this 
                         morning?

               Evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her Jeans.

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I went riding rather early.

                                     GITTES
                         Looks like you went quite a distance.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, Just riding bareback, that's 
                         all. Anyway, you might try the Oak 
                         Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. 
                         Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks 
                         around them. Otherwise he'll be home 
                         by 6:30.

                                     GITTES
                         I'll stop by.

                                     EVELYN
                         Please call first.

               Gittes nods.

               EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR  DAY

               Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel 
               up into the parched hills.

               TWO FIRE TRUCKS

               One a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir.

               The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open and there 
               are people milling around. The reservoir is below.

               Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE.

                                     GUARD
                         Sorry, this is closed to the public, 
                         sir.

               Gittes hesitates only a moment, then:

                                     GITTES
                              (to the Guard)
                         It's all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy 
                         Chief in the Department.

               He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief 
               pocket, hands it to the Guard.

                                     GUARD
                         Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.

               Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the 
               reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well.

               Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their 
               backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the 
               reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently 
               dredging for something.

               One of the men turns and sees Gittes. He recognizes Gittes 
               and is visibly shocked.

                                     LOACH
                         Gittes, for Chrissakes.

                                     GITTES
                         Loach.

                                     LOACH
                              (moving to Gittes, 
                              taking him by the 
                              arm)
                         C'mon, get out of here before --

               EXT. RESERVOIR  DAY

               Loach tries to ease him down the path.

                                     GITTES
                         Before what? What the hell's going 
                         on?

               At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge 
               of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns 
               around. He's a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties, 
               LUIS ESCOBAR.

               Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at 
               seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy.

               Loach is actually sweating. Finally, Escobar smiles.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Hello, Jake.

                                     GITTES
                              (without smiling)
                         How are you, Lou?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I have a cold I can't seem to shake 
                         but other than that, I'm fine.

                                     GITTES
                         Summer colds are the worst.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Yeah, they are.

               Gittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case.

                                     A FIREMAN
                         No smoking, sir. It's a fire hazard 
                         this time of year.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I think we can make an exception. 
                         I'll see he's careful with the 
                         matches.

                                     GITTES
                              (lighting up)
                         Thanks, Lou.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         How'd you get past the guards?

                                     GITTES
                         Well, to tell you the truth, I lied 
                         a little.

               Escobar nods. They walk a couple of steps. The other police, 
               two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You've done well by yourself.

                                     GITTES
                         I get by.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Well, sometimes it takes a while for 
                         a man to find himself and I guess 
                         you have.

                                     LOACH
                         Poking around in other people's dirty 
                         linen.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. Tell me, you still throw 
                         Chinamen into jail for spitting on 
                         the laundry?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You're behind the times, Jake. They've 
                         got steam irons now.
                              (smiles)
                         And I'm out of Chinatown.

                                     GITTES
                         Since when?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Since I made Lieutenant.

               It's apparent Gittes is impressed despite himself.

                                     GITTES
                         Congratulations.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?

                                     GITTES
                         Looking for someone.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Who?

                                     GITTES
                         Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Oh yes.

                                     GITTES
                         I'd like to talk to him.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You're welcome to try. There he is.

               Escobar points down to the reservoir. A couple of men using 
               poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. It can be 
               SEEN that one of them has hooked something.

               He shouts. The other man hooks it, too. They pull, revealing 
               the soaking back of a man's coat. They start to pull the 
               body into the skiff.

               INT. CORONER'S OFFICE  EVELYN AND ESCOBAR

               Are standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet 
               drawn back. Evelyn nods.

               Escobar drops the sheet. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet 
               to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying 
               to keep the corpse from hearing them.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         It looks like he was washed the entire 
                         length of the runoff channel. Could 
                         he swim?

                                     EVELYN
                         Of course.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Obviously the fall must have knocked 
                         him out.

               Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner's assistant 
               wheels the body out of the office.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (continuing)
                         This alleged affair he was having. 
                         The publicity didn't make him morose 
                         or unhappy?

               OUTSIDE THE CORONER'S

               Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and 
               listening. At this question, he rises and looks through the 
               doorway.

               Escobar sees him, ignores him. Evelyn doesn't see him.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...Well, it didn't make him happy...

                                     ESCOBAR
                         But there is no possibility he would 
                         have taken his own life?

                                     EVELYN
                              (sharply)
                         No.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (a little uncomfortably 
                              now)
                         Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know 
                         the name of the young woman in 
                         question?

               Evelyn shows a flash of annoyance.

                                     EVELYN
                         No.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Do you know where she might be?

                                     EVELYN
                         Certainly not!

               Escobar and Evelyn move slowly toward the door.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You and your husband never discussed 
                         her?

                                     EVELYN
                              (stopping, faltering)
                         He... we did... he wouldn't tell me 
                         her name.  We quarreled over her... 
                         of course. It came as a complete 
                         surprise to me.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         A complete surprise?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         But I thought you'd hired a private 
                         investigator.

                                     EVELYN
                         A private investigator?

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (gesturing vaguely 
                              toward the door)
                         Mr. Gittes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well yes.

               Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a 
               foot or two from her. She stops cold. They look at one another 
               for a long moment.

                                     EVELYN
                              (her eyes on Gittes)
                         But I... I... did that because I 
                         thought it was a nasty rumor I'd put 
                         an end to...

               She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes. Escobar is right 
               at her back. Gittes says nothing.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         And when did Mr. Gittes inform you 
                         that these rumors had some foundation 
                         in fact?

               Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.

                                     GITTES
                              (smoothly)
                         Just before the story broke in the 
                         papers, Lou.

               Escobar nods. They begin to walk slowly, again have to move 
               out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of 
               one of the Coroner cubicles.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You wouldn't happen to know the 
                         present whereabouts of the young 
                         woman.

                                     GITTES
                         No.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Or her name?

                                     GITTES
                         No.

               They have walked a few steps further down the hall.

                                     EVELYN
                         Will you need me for anything else, 
                         Lieutenant?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of 
                         course you have my deepest sympathy 
                         and if we need anymore information, 
                         we'll be in touch.

                                     GITTES
                         I'll walk her to her car, be right 
                         back.

               ESCOBAR'S POV

               Evelyn glances at Gittes. They go through a couple of outer 
               doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer 
               hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in 
               L.A." and "Southern Cafeteria."

               Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking 
               questions. Gittes brushes them aside.

               EVELYN AND GITTES  AT HER CAR

               In a small parking lot.

               Evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for something 
               in her purse.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.

                                     EVELYN
                              (flushed, perspiring)
                         ...Just a minute...

                                     GITTES
                              (touching her gently)
                         You left your keys in the ignition.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh... thank you.

               She glances down, leans against the side of the car.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing)
                         Thank you for going along with me. I 
                         just didn't want to explain 
                         anything... I'll send you a check.

                                     GITTES
                              (puzzled)
                         A check?

               Evelyn gets in her car.

                                     EVELYN
                         To make it official, I hired you.

               She drives off, leaving Gittes gaping.

               INT. CORONER'S OFFICE HALLWAY

                                     GITTES
                         Don't give me that, Lou. You hauled 
                         me down here for a statement.

               Escobar shrugs.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I don't want it anymore.

                                     GITTES
                         No?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         No. It was an accident.

                                     GITTES
                         You mean that's what you're going to 
                         call it.

               Escobar looks up.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         That's right.
                              (contemptuously)
                         Out of respect for his civic position.

               Resume walking.

               Gittes laughs.

                                     GITTES
                         What'd he do, Lou, make a pass at 
                         your sister?

               Escobar stops.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         No, he drowned a cousin of mine with 
                         about five hundred other people. But 
                         they weren't very important, just a 
                         bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a 
                         dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't 
                         come out of this smelling like a 
                         rose, you know.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh yeah? Can you think of something 
                         to charge me with?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         When I do, you'll hear about it.

               Gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall.

               OUTSIDE MORGUE

               Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with 
               Mulwray's name. MORTY is standing near it in a doorway to an 
               adjoining room. A RADIO is on, and with it the announcement 
               that they're about to hear another chapter in the life of 
               Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle. Another Coroner's 
               assistant sits at the table, listening to the radio and eating 
               a sandwich.

               Gittes ambles into the room.

                                     MORTY
                              (a cigarette dangling 
                              out of his mouth)
                         Jake, what're you doin' here?

                                     GITTES
                         Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, 
                         I thought I'd drop by and see who 
                         died lately.

               Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. CAMERA GETS ITS 
               FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray's body. Eyes open, the face badly 
               cut and bruised.

                                     MORTY
                         Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle 
                         of a drought, the water commissioner 
                         drowns. Only in L.A.

                                     GITTES
                              (looking at. Mulwray)
                         Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.

                                     MORTY
                         That's a long fall.

                                     GITTES
                         So how are you, Morty?

               Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an 
               assistant.

                                     MORTY
                         Never better. You know me, Jake.

               As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks 
               into a wrenching spasm of coughing. Gittes spots the other 
               body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                              (picking up on cough)
                         Yeah, so who you got there?

               Morty pulls back the sheet.

                                     MORTY
                         Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to 
                         hang around Ferguson's Alley.

               Morty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs.

                                     MORTY
                              (continuing)
                         Quite a character. Lately he'd been 
                         living in one of the downtown storm 
                         drains. Had a bureau dresser down 
                         there and everything.

               Gittes has already lost interest. He starts away.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                                     MORTY
                         Drowned, too.

               This stops Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Come again?

                                     MORTY
                         Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in 
                         the bottom of the riverbed.

                                     GITTES
                         The L.A. River?

                                     MORTY
                              (a little puzzled)
                         Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's 
                         wrong with that?

               Gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely.

                                     GITTES
                         It's bone dry, Morty.

                                     MORTY
                         It's not completely dry.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a 
                         damp riverbed either, I don't care 
                         how soused he was. That's like 
                         drowning in a teaspoon.

               Morty shrugs.

                                     MORTY
                         We got water out of him, Jake. He 
                         drowned.

               Gittes walks away mumbling.

                                     GITTES
                         Jesus, this town...

               EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD  GITTES  DAY

               He's parked on an overpass. The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on 
               one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into the 
               riverbed below.

               FROM THE BRIDGE

               Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its 
               contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below him, lying 
               half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank 
               of the river is a sign that proclaims "OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE 
               IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of 
               sorts. Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford 
               seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc. The trashy remains of 
               Shuhardt's home.

               Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near 
               the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. Gittes 
               pulls it out, swearing.

               He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears 
               the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.

               Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican 
               Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy 
               bank.

               They look at one another a moment.

                                     GITTES
                              (calling out to him)
                         You were riding here the other day, 
                         weren't you...?

               The Boy doesn't answer.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Speak English?... Habla Ingles?

                                     THE BOY
                              (finally)
                         Si.

                                     GITTES
                         Didn't you talk to a man here... few 
                         days ago... wore glasses... he...

               The Boy nods.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         What did you talk about, mind my 
                         asking?

               The shadows of the two are very long now.

                                     THE BOY
                              (finally)
                         The water.

                                     GITTES
                         What about the water?

                                     THE BOY
                         When it comes.

                                     GITTES
                         When it comes? What'd you tell him?

                                     THE BOY
                         Comes in different parts of the river. 
                         Every night a different part.

               Gittes nods. The horse snorts. The Boy rides slowly on.

               EXT. RIVERBED  DUSK

               Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the 
               storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed above 
               toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting.

               EXT. GITTES IN CAR  NIGHTFALL

               Winding his way up a section of the Hollywood Hills. He picks 
               up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's 
               windwing.

               GITTES IN CAR  MOVING

               Along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows 
               the channel with the car spotlight. He turns at a fork in 
               the road which allows him to continue following the flood 
               channel.

               FURTHER UP  MOVING

               The road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is 
               overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.

               STILL FURTHER  NIGHT

               The road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus 
               are everywhere. It is very still. Another turn and a pie-
               shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be 
               GLIMPSED.

               POV  CHAIN-LINK FENCE

               Over the road, bolted. It says "OAK PASS RESERVOIR. KEEP 
               OUT. NO TRESPASSING."

               The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel 
               and down into it, making access along the channel itself 
               impossible.

               Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the 
               spotlight.

               A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole 
               illumination.

               There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.

               Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood 
               channel itself.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE

               Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage 
               toward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the 
               reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.

               Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into 
               the flood control channel, which is at this point about four 
               feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men 
               scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. 
               Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.

               He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is 
               another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles 
               Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.

               GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL  NIGHT

               Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over 
               him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging 
               into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the 
               overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of 
               the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's 
               brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold. 
               He's nearly strained through it.

               Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing 
               water by means of the fence itself.

               Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and 
               makes his way toward his car.

               AT GITTES' CAR

               He fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing.

                                     GITTES
                              (grumbling)
                         Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.

               He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a SMALLER 
               MAN stop him. Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning 
               his arms, holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a 
               switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left 
               nostril.

                                     SMALLER MAN
                              (shaking with emotion)
                         Hold it there, kitty cat.

               CLOSE  GITTES

               Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead 
               gleaming on the silvery blade.

                                     THE SMALLER MAN
                         You are a very nosey fellow, kitty 
                         cat... you know what happens to nosey 
                         fellows?

               The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage 
               when he says this. Gittes doesn't move.

                                     SMALLER MAN
                              (continuing)
                         Wanna guess? No? Okay, lose their 
                         noses.

               With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade, 
               laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes 
               screams.

               Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.

               Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood 
               from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the Smaller Man 
               stare at him.

                                     THE SMALLER MAN
                              (continuing)
                         Next time you lose the whole thing, 
                         kitty cat. I'll cut it off and feed 
                         it to my goldfish, understand?

                                     MULVIHILL
                         Tell him you understand, Gittes.

               EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR  NIGHT

               Gittes is now groveling on his hands and knees.

                                     GITTES
                              (mumbling)
                         I understand...

               Gittes on the ground can see only his tormentor's two-tone 
               brown and white wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his 
               blood.

               THE SHOE

               Comes up and lightly shoves Gittes into the ground. The SOUND 
               of FOOTSTEPS RETREATING, Gittes gasping.

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE  GITTES

               Sits behind his desk, BACK TO CAMERA, not moving. Duffy sits 
               staring at nothing, Walsh moves uneasily around the room.

               The PHONE is RINGING. Sophie BUZZES.

                                     GITTES
                              (pressing down intercom)
                         Yeah, Sophie.

                                     SOPHIE'S VOICE
                         A Miss Sessions calling.

                                     GITTES
                         Who?

                                     SOPHIE'S VOICE
                         Ida Sessions.

                                     GITTES
                         Don't know her. Take a number.

               NEW ANGLE  REVEALING

               A bandage spread-eagled across Gittes' nose.

                                     WALSH
                         So some contractor wants to build a 
                         dam and he makes a few payoffs. So 
                         what?

               Gittes turns slowly to Walsh. He lightly taps his nose.

                                     WALSH
                              (continuing)
                         Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll 
                         claim you were trespassing.

                                     GITTES
                         I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the 
                         big boys that are making the payoffs.

                                     DUFFY
                         Then what'll you do?

                                     GITTES
                         Sue the shit out of 'em.

                                     WALSH
                         Yeah?

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? 
                         Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. 
                         We'll make a killing.
                              (a dazzling smile)
                         We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice 
                         a week, we'll be pissing on ice the 
                         rest of our lives.

                                     WALSH
                         Sue people like that they're liable 
                         to be having dinner with the Judge 
                         who's trying the suit.

               Gittes looks irritated. The PHONE RINGS again.

                                     SOPHIE'S VOICE
                         Miss Ida Sessions again. She says 
                         you know her.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay.

               Gittes picks up the phone. He winks to his boys.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe 
                         we've had the pleasure.

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. 
                         Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                              (clowning a little 
                              for the boys)
                         Isn't everybody? What can I do for 
                         you, Miss Sessions?

               Walsh promptly starts to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story.

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. 
                         I didn't come in to see you on my 
                         own.

                                     GITTES
                         When did you come in?

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         I was the one who pretended to be 
                         Mrs. Mulwray, remember?

               Walsh has finished off the punch line and both men are 
               laughing raucously. Gittes drops the mail he's been loafing 
               through and puts his hand over the receiver.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Duffy and Walsh)
                         Shut the fuck up!
                              (then back to Ida)
                         ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss 
                         Sessions, just going over a detail 
                         or two with my associates... you 
                         were saying?

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         Well I never expected anything to 
                         happen like what happened to Mr. 
                         Mulwray, the point is if it ever 
                         comes out I want somebody to know I 
                         didn't know what would happen.

                                     GITTES
                         I understand... if you could tell me 
                         who employed you, Miss Sessions. 
                         That could help us both.

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         Oh no.

                                     GITTES
                         ...Why don't you give me your address 
                         and we can talk this over?

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the 
                         obituary column of today's Times...

                                     GITTES
                         The obituary column?

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         You'll find one of those people.

                                     GITTES
                         'Those people?' Miss Sessions.

               She hangs up. Gittes looks to his two men.

               INT. BROWN DERBY  CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER

               Gittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds the 
               OBITUARY COLUMN, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column 
               from the paper and puts it in his pocket.

               When he closes the paper we can SEE headlines in the left 
               hand column: "WATER BOND ISSUE PASSES COUNCIL". Ten million 
               dollar referendum to go before the public.

               Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so. He 
               rises, allows her to sit.

               CLOSE ON EVELYN

               Gittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly... She's 
               wearing dove gray gabardine, subdued, tailored.

                                     GITTES
                         Thanks for coming... drink?

               The waiter's appeared. Evelyn is looking at Gittes' nose.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tom Collins with lime, not lemon, 
                         please.

               Evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves. When she looks 
               back up she stares expectantly at Gittes.

               Gittes pulls out a torn envelope. The initials ECM can be 
               SEEN in a delicate scroll on the corner of it.

                                     GITTES
                         I got your check in the mall.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.

               Gittes' fingers the envelope. He coughs.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not 
                         good enough.

                                     EVELYN
                              (a little embarrassed)
                         Well, how much would you like?

               CLOSE ON EVELYN

                                     GITTES
                         Stop it. The money's fine. It's 
                         generous but you've shortchanged me 
                         on the story.

                                     EVELYN
                              (coolly)
                         I have?

                                     GITTES
                         I think so. Something besides your 
                         husband's death was bothering you. 
                         You were upset but not that upset.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mr. Gittes...
                              (icily)
                         Don't tell me how I feel.

               The drinks come. The waiter sets them down.

                                     GITTES
                         Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband 
                         dies, you drop the lawsuit like a 
                         hot potato, and all of it quicker 
                         than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse 
                         me. Then you ask me to lie to the 
                         police.

                                     EVELYN
                         It wasn't much of a lie.

                                     GITTES
                         If your husband was killed it was.
                              (meaning check)
                         This can look like you paid me off 
                         to withhold evidence.

                                     EVELYN
                         But he wasn't killed.

               Gittes smiles.

                                     GITTES
                         I think you're hiding something, 
                         Mrs. Mulwray.

               Evelyn remains unperturbed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well, I suppose I am... actually I 
                         knew about the affair.

                                     GITTES
                         How did you find out?

                                     EVELYN
                         My husband.

                                     GITTES
                         He told you?

               Evelyn nods.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         And you weren't the slightest bit 
                         upset about it?

                                     EVELYN
                         I was grateful.

               Evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed.

                                     GITTES
                         You'll have to explain that, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.

                                     EVELYN
                         Why?

                                     GITTES
                              (a flash of annoyance)
                         Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my 
                         metiay.  When a wife tells me she's 
                         happy her husband is cheating on her 
                         it runs contrary to my experience.

               Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         Unless what?

                                     GITTES
                              (looking directly at 
                              her)
                         She's cheating on him.

               Evelyn doesn't reply.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Were you?

               Evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't like the word 'cheat.'

                                     GITTES
                         Did you have affairs?

                                     EVELYN
                              (flashing)
                         Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Did he know?

                                     EVELYN
                              (almost an outburst)
                         Well I wouldn't run home and tell 
                         him whenever I went to bed with 
                         someone, if that's what you mean.

               This subdues Gittes a little. Evelyn is still a little heated.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing; more 
                              calmly)
                         Is there anything else you want to 
                         know?

                                     GITTES
                         Where you were when your husband 
                         died.

                                     EVELYN
                         I can't tell you.

                                     GITTES
                         You mean you don't know where you 
                         were?

                                     EVELYN
                         I mean I can't tell you.

                                     GITTES
                         You were seeing someone, too.

               Evelyn looks squarely at him. She doesn't deny it.

                                     GITTES
                         For very long?

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't see anyone for very long, 
                         Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. 
                         Now I think you know all you need to 
                         about me. I didn't want publicity. I 
                         didn't want to go into any of this, 
                         then or now. Is this all?

               Gittes nods.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh, by the way. What's the 'C' stand 
                         for?

               He's been fingering the envelope...

                                     EVELYN
                              (she stammers slightly)
                         K... Cross.

                                     GITTES
                         That your maiden name?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes... why?

                                     GITTES
                         No reason.

               Evelyn turns into Gittes.

                                     EVELYN
                         You must've had a reason to ask me 
                         that.

                                     GITTES
                              (shrugs)
                         No. I'm just a snoop.

                                     EVELYN
                         You seem to have had a reason for 
                         every other question.

                                     GITTES
                         No, not for that one.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't believe you.

               Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.

                                     GITTES
                              (moving in)
                         Do me a favor. Sit still and act 
                         like I'm charming.

               Evelyn involuntarily draws back.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         There's somebody here. Say something.
                         Anything. Something like we're being 
                         intimate.

               Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle 
               his hand in front of their faces. She stares at him.

                                     EVELYN
                              (meaning his nose)
                         How did it happen?

                                     GITTES
                              (quietly)
                         Been meaning to talk to you about 
                         that.

                                     EVELYN
                              (quietly)
                         Maybe putting your nose in other 
                         people's business?

                                     GITTES
                              (quietly)
                         More like other people putting their 
                         business in my nose.

               Evelyn actually smiles a little.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         You son of a bitch.

               Gittes looks up and flashes his smile.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Match. How're you?

               MRS. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a 
               glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other, 
               and a menacing look in her eye.

                                     MRS. MATCH
                         Don't give me that, you son of a 
                         bitch.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay.

               Gittes turns back to Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                              (softly)
                         Another satisfied client?

                                     GITTES
                         Another satisfied client's wife.

                                     MRS. MATCH
                         Look at me, you son of a bitch. You... 
                         you bastard. Are you happy, are you 
                         happy now?

               She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse. Gittes 
               covers himself. Waiters rush over.

                                     MRS. MATCH
                         You smug son of a bitch. My husband's 
                         so upset he sweats all night! How do 
                         you think that makes me feel?

                                     GITTES
                         Sweaty?

               Mrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again. She catches him 
               on the nose. It hurts. He covers it, then swings his leg out 
               from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin.

               Mrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink. She grabs 
               her shin, hopping around a little. The waiters who had tried 
               to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over.

                                     GITTES
                         Let's get out of here before she 
                         picks up her purse.

               They rise and move toward the door.

                                     EVELYN
                              (quietly)
                         Tough guy, huh?

               Gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods.

               OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT  DUSK

               Gittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant. The 
               attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh, no. I've got my own car. The 
                         creamcolored Packard.

                                     GITTES
                              (to attendant who 
                              dutifully starts for 
                              her car)
                         Wait a minute, sonny.
                              (to Evelyn)
                         I think you better come with me.

                                     EVELYN
                         What for? There's nothing more to 
                         say.
                              (to attendant)
                         Get my car, please.

               The attendant starts after it again. Gittes leans on the 
               open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but 
               spits it out.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay, go home. But in case you're 
                         interested your husband was murdered. 
                         Somebody's dumping tons of water out 
                         of the city reservoirs when we're 
                         supposedly in the middle of a drought, 
                         he found out, and he was killed. 
                         There's a waterlogged drunk in the 
                         morgue. Involuntary manslaughter if 
                         anybody wants to take the trouble 
                         which they don't. It looks like half 
                         the city is trying to cover it all 
                         up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.
                              (now inches from her)
                         I goddam near lost my nose! And I 
                         like it. I like breathing through 
                         it. And I still think you're hiding 
                         something.

               Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. She stares at 
               Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the car door 
               closed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mr. Gittes.

               He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn 
               looking after him.

               INT. DWP  MULWRAY'S OFFICE DOOR

               WITH ITS LETTERING:

                            "HOLLIS I. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER"

               Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary. She looks up. 
               She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him.

                                     GITTES
                         J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

               The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner 
               office.

               Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment. He sees 
               a photographic display of "THE HISTORY OF THE DWP. THE EARLY 
               YEARS", along the wall. He stops as he spots a photo of the 
               man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier. He is 
               standing high in the mountains, near a pass. The caption 
               reads "JULIAN CROSS. 1905".

               Cross is strikingly handsome.

               Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn's 
               check. He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down 
               under the middle initial C, then he looks back to the photos.

               The Secretary returns.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some 
                         time.

                                     GITTES
                         Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He's liable to be tied up 
                         indefinitely.

                                     GITTES
                         I take a long lunch. All day 
                         sometimes.

               Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one. 
               She refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You 
               Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more 
               photographs.

               INT. MULWRAY'S OFFICES

               Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along 
               with Julian Cross. One of the captions: "HOLLIS MULWRAY AND 
               JULIAN CROSS AS THE AQUEDUCT CLEARS THE SANTA SUSANNAH PASS. 
               1912".

               Gittes, still humming, turns to the Secretary.

                                     GITTES
                         Julian Cross worked for the water 
                         department?

                                     SECRETARY
                              (looking up)
                         Yes. No.

                                     GITTES
                              (humming, then)
                         He did or he didn't?

                                     SECRETARY
                         He owned it.

               Gittes is genuinely surprised at this.

                                     GITTES
                         He owned the water department?

                                     SECRETARY
                         Yes.

                                     GITTES
                         He owned the entire water supply for 
                         the city?

                                     SECRETARY
                         Yes.

                                     GITTES
                              (really surprised)
                         How did they get it away from him?

                                     SECRETARY
                              (a sigh, then)
                         Mr. Mulwray felt the public should 
                         own the display. The water. If you'll 
                         just read the display.

                                     GITTES
                              (glances back, hums, 
                              then)
                         Mulwray? I thought you said Cross 
                         owned the department.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Along with Mr. Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                         They were partners.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (testily)
                         Yes. Yes, they were partners.

               She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office.

               Gittes goes back to the photographs. He hears a SCRATCHING 
               SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door.

               He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door. 
               Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the 
               outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise.

               The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (to Gittes)
                         Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

               Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office.

               INT. DWP  YELBURTON & GITTES

               There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's 
               attitude. He's now head of the department.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. 
                         These staff meetings, they just go 
                         on and on.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, must be especially tough to 
                         take over under these circumstances.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Oh yes. Hollis was the best department 
                         head the city's ever had. My goodness, 
                         what happened to your nose?

                                     GITTES
                              (smiles)
                         I cut myself shaving.

                                     YELBURTON
                         You ought to be more careful. That 
                         must really smart.

                                     GITTES
                         Only when I breathe.

                                     YELBURTON
                              (laughing)
                         Only when you breathe... don't tell 
                         me you're still working for Mrs. 
                         Mulwray?

                                     GITTES
                         I never was.

                                     YELBURTON
                              (stops smiling)
                         I don't understand.

                                     GITTES
                         Neither do I, actually. But you hired 
                         me or you hired that chippie to hire 
                         me.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit 
                         of sense.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, look at it this way, Mr. 
                         Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to 
                         build a dam and he had a reputation 
                         that was hard to get around, so.  
                         you decided to ruin it. Then he found 
                         out that you were dumping water every 
                         night. Then he was drowned.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous 
                         accusation.  I don't know what you're 
                         talking about.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the 
                         Times will. Dumping thousands of 
                         gallons of water down the toilet in 
                         the middle of a drought.  That's 
                         news.

               Gittes heads toward the door.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. 
                         We're... well, we're not anxious for 
                         this to get around, but we have been 
                         diverting a little water to irrigate 
                         avocado and walnut groves in the 
                         northwest valley. As you know, the 
                         farmers there have no legal right to 
                         our water, and since the drought 
                         we've had to cut them off. The city 
                         comes first, naturally.  But, well, 
                         we've been trying to help some of 
                         them out, keep them from going under.  
                         Naturally when you divert water you 
                         get a little runoff.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, a little runoff. Where are 
                         those orchards?

                                     YELBURTON
                         I said, the northwest valley.

                                     GITTES
                         That's like saying they're in Arizona.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and 
                         I can't give you an exact location...

               Gittes nods.

                                     GITTES
                         You're a married man, am I right?

                                     YELBURTON
                         Yes...

                                     GITTES
                         Hard working, have a wife and kids...

                                     YELBURTON
                         Yes...

                                     GITTES
                         I don't want to nail you. I just 
                         want to know who put you up to it.  
                         I'll give you a few days to think it 
                         over.
                              (hands him a card)
                         Call me. I can help. Who knows?  
                         Maybe we can lay the whole thing off 
                         on a few big shots and you can stay 
                         head of the department for the next 
                         twenty years.

               Gittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton.

               INT. GITTES OFFICE

               Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries 
               to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office.

               EVELYN MULWRAY

               Is sitting, smoking. She looks up when he enters.

                                     EVELYN
                         What's your usual salary?

               Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight 
               of her.

                                     GITTES
                         Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty 
                         for each of my operators, plus 
                         expenses, plus my fee if I show 
                         results.

               He's sitting now. Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very 
               shaken.

                                     EVELYN
                         Whoever's behind my husband's death, 
                         why have they gone to all this 
                         trouble?

                                     GITTES
                         Money. How they plan to make it by 
                         emptying the reservoirs, that I don't 
                         know.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'll pay your salary plus five 
                         thousand dollars if you find out 
                         what happened to Hollis and who is 
                         involved.

               Gittes buzzes Sophie.

                                     GITTES
                         Sophie, draw up one of our standard 
                         forms for Mrs. Mulwray.
                              (he leans back; to 
                              Evelyn)
                         Tell me, did you get married before 
                         or after Mulwray and your father 
                         sold the water department?

               Evelyn nearly jumps at the question.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Your father is Julian Cross, isn't 
                         he?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, of course. It was quite a while 
                         after. I was just out of grade school 
                         when they did that.

                                     GITTES
                         So you married your father's business 
                         partner?

               Evelyn nods. She lights another cigarette.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; staring 
                              at her, points to 
                              the ashtray)
                         You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh.

               She quickly stubs one out.

                                     GITTES
                         Is there something upsetting about 
                         my asking about your father?

                                     EVELYN
                         No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis 
                         and my fa... my father had a falling 
                         out...

                                     GITTES
                         Over the water department, or over 
                         you?

                                     EVELYN
                              (quickly)
                         Not over me. Why would they have a 
                         falling out over me?

                                     GITTES
                              (noting her nervousness)
                         Then it was over the water department.

                                     EVELYN
                         Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes 
                         and no.  Hollis felt the public should 
                         own the water but I don't think my 
                         father felt that way.  Actually, it 
                         was over the Van der Lip. The dam 
                         that broke.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh, yeah?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. He never forgave him for it.

                                     GITTES
                         Never forgave him for what?

                                     EVELYN
                         For talking him into building it, he 
                         never forgave my father... They 
                         haven't spoken to this day.

                                     GITTES
                              (starts a little)
                         You sure shout that?

                                     EVELYN
                         Of course I'm sure.

                                     GITTES
                         What about you? Do you and your father 
                         get along?

               Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn's reply. 
               Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of Evelyn.

                                     GITTES
                         Sign here... The other copy's for 
                         you.

               She signs it. When she looks back up, Gittes is staring 
               intently at her.

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you thinking?

                                     GITTES
                              (picking up one of 
                              copies, folding it, 
                              putting it in his 
                              pocket)
                         Before this I turned on the faucet, 
                         it came out hot and cold, I didn't 
                         think there was a thing to it.

               INT. SEAPLANE

               The engines make the small cabin vibrate. Gittes threads his 
               way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin, which 
               is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and their fishing 
               gear. Gittes is poked by a pole, has to move along.

               One of the old men says something to him.

                                     GITTES
                              (above the engines)
                         What?

                                     OLD MAN
                         You'll have to sit with the pilot.

               Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the PILOT looks up  
               nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half eaten cheese 
               sandwich out of Gittes' seat.

               EXT. HARBOR - SEAPLANE

               Taxiing down the ramp into the sea. In a moment, it kicks up 
               a spray of foam and takes off.

               INT. COCKPIT

               The island gradually looming larger before the Pilot and 
               Gittes.

               The Pilot glances over at Gittes who, as usual, is impeccably 
               dressed. A contrast to the others on the plane.

                                     PILOT
                              (above the engines)
                         Well, you're not going fishing.

               Gittes shakes his head.

                                     GITTES
                         Not exactly.

                                     PILOT
                              (winks)
                         But that's what you told your wife.

               The Pilot laughs raucously. Gittes laughs politely.

                                     PILOT
                         Lots of fellas do. Tell the little 
                         woman they're going on a fishing 
                         trip, then shack up with some little 
                         twist on the island... she pretty?

                                     GITTES
                              (abruptly)
                         I'm going to see a man called Julian 
                         Cross. Ever heard of him?

                                     PILOT
                         Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, 
                         mister?... I ask because he doesn't 
                         see a whole lot of people.

                                     GITTES
                         I'm working for his daughter.

                                     PILOT
                              (surprised)
                         That right?... She used to be some 
                         looker.

                                     GITTES
                         She ain't exactly long in the tooth 
                         now.

                                     PILOT
                         She must be about thirty-three, thirty-
                         four.

                                     GITTES
                         You must be thinking of a different 
                         daughter.

                                     PILOT
                         No, he's only got one, I remember 
                         her age, I read it in the newspapers 
                         when she ran away.

                                     GITTES
                         She ran away?

                                     PILOT
                         Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the 
                         time. Julian Cross' daughter. God 
                         almighty. She was a wild little thing.

               He gives a sidelong glance to Gittes, a little concerned 
               he's said too much.

                                     PILOT
                              (continuing)
                         Course, she settled down nicely.

                                     GITTES
                              (smiling a little)
                         Well, you never know, do you?

                                     PILOT
                              (loosening up)
                         That's for sure.

                                     GITTES
                         Why'd she run away?

                                     PILOT
                         Oh, you know. She was sixteen or 
                         seventeen.

                                     GITTES
                              (nudging him)
                         We missed the best of it, didn't we, 
                         pal?

               Both men laugh a little lewdly.

                                     PILOT
                         She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she 
                         was knocked up and didn't even know 
                         who the father was. Went there to 
                         get rid of it.

                                     GITTES
                         You don't say?

                                     PILOT
                         Cross was looking for her all over 
                         the country. Offered rewards, 
                         everything. Felt real sorry for him, 
                         with all his money.

               ALBACORE CLUB  DAY

               A pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building 
               on the bay overlooking the harbor. The seaplane lands. A 
               motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns 
               and heads in the direction of the plane.

               EXT. WINDING ROAD  RANCHO DEL CRUCE

               Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign 
               with a cross painted below the name.

               The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island. 
               As the wagon continues one can SEE that it is actually a 
               miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and 
               canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of 
               the sea.

               The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered 
               around a corral. The circle of men drift apart, leaving JULIAN 
               CROSS standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome 
               in a rough linen shirt and jeans. When he talks his strong 
               face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged.

               EXT. BRIDLE PATH  GITTES & CROSS

               Walking toward the main house. A classic Monterey. A horse 
               led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates 
               in the center of the path they are taking. Gittes doesn't 
               notice.

                                     CROSS
                         Horseshit.

               Gittes pauses, not certain he has heard correctly.

                                     GITTES
                         Sir?

                                     CROSS
                         I said horseshit.
                              (pointing)
                         Horseshit.

                                     GITTES
                         Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. 
                         I'll give you that.

               Cross pauses when they reach the dung pile. He removes his 
               hat and waves it, inhales deeply.

                                     CROSS
                         Love the smell of it. A lot of people 
                         do but of course they won't admit 
                         it. Look at the shape.

               Gittes glances down out of politeness.

                                     CROSS
                              (continuing; smiling, 
                              almost enthusiastic)
                         Always the same.

               Cross walks on. Gittes follows.

                                     GITTES
                              (not one to let it go)
                         Always?

                                     CROSS
                         What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the 
                         animal's sick or something.
                              (stops and glances. 
                              back)
                         And the steam rising off it like 
                         that in the morning. That's life, 
                         Mr. Gittes. Life.

               They move on.

                                     CROSS
                              (continuing)
                         Perhaps this preoccupation with 
                         horseshit may seem a little perverse, 
                         but I ask you to remember this. One 
                         way or another, it's what I've dealt 
                         in all my life. Let's have breakfast.

               EXT. COURTYARD VERANDA  GITTES & CROSS AT BREAKFAST

               Below them is a corral where hands take Arabians, one by 
               one, and work them out, letting them run and literally kick 
               up their heels.

               Cross' attention is diverted by the animals from time to 
               time. An impeccable Mexican butler serves them their main 
               course, broiled fish.

                                     CROSS
                         You know, you've got a nasty 
                         reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.

                                     GITTES
                              (dubious)
                         Thanks.

                                     CROSS
                         If you were a bank president that 
                         would be one thing, but in your 
                         business it's admirable. And it's 
                         good advertising.

                         It doesn't hurt.

                         It's why you attract a client like 
                         my daughter.

                                     GITTES
                         Probably.

                                     CROSS
                         But I'm surprised you're still working 
                         for her, unless she's suddenly come 
                         up with another husband.

                                     GITTES
                         No. She happens to think the last 
                         one was murdered.

               Cross is visibly surprised.

                                     CROSS
                         How did she get that idea?

                                     GITTES
                         I think I gave it to her.

               Cross nods.

                                     CROSS
                         Uh-huh. Oh I hope you don't mind. I 
                         believe they should be served with 
                         the head.

               Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed 
               over with the heat of cooking.

                                     GITTES
                         Fine, as long as you don't serve 
                         chicken that way.

                                     GITTES
                         They're calling it an accident.

                         Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.

                         Very.

                         Far as it goes. Of course he has to 
                         swim in the same water we all do.

                         Of course, but you've got no reason 
                         to think he's bungled the case?

                                     CROSS
                         It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes 
                         me think you're taking my daughter 
                         for a ride. Financially speaking, of 
                         course. How much are you charging 
                         her?

                         think about that to remember, do 
                         you?

               Gittes laughs.

                                     GITTES
                         If you want an answer to that question 
                         I can always put one of my men on 
                         the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.

                         Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a 
                         disturbed woman who's lost her 
                         husband. I don't want her taken 
                         advantage of. Sit down.

                                     GITTES
                         What for?

                                     CROSS
                         You may think you know what you're 
                         dealing with, but believe me, you 
                         don't.

               This stops Gittes. He seems faintly mused by it.

                                     CROSS
                         Why is that funny?

                         It's what the D.A. used to tell me 
                         about Chinatown.

                                     CROSS

                         Mainly that you're rich and too 
                         respectable to want your name in the

                         No. She's probably scared to death.

               Cross starts to reply, then there's the SOUND of a MARIACHI

               yards off. They are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback. 
               For the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along

               Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes

                         Part of it's in Ventura County. We 
                         don't have Ventura County in our 
                         Hall of Records.

               Which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles.

                                     GITTES
                         I'll settle for L.A. County.

                                     CLERK
                              (regards him, then)
                         Row twenty-three, section C.

               The Clerk turns away abruptly. Gittes regards his back a 
               moment, then goes to the stacks.

               THROUGH THE STACKS

               Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something. The 
               second clerk gets on the phone. Gittes watches a moment, 
               then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks.

               He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it. It's 
               huge and there's a lot to go through.

               The print itself makes him squint.

               INSERT PAGE

               Showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS 
               designation where the description of the land parcel is long 
               and hopelessly involved e.g. '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 
               7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old 
               and faded. In the owners' column, however there are numerous 
               freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners.

                                     GITTES
                         Hauls the huge volume back to the 
                         Clerk's desk.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Clerk)
                         Say... uh... sonny.

               The Clerk turns sharply around.

                                     GITTES
                         How come all these new names are 
                         pasted into the plat book?

                                     CLERK
                         Land sales out of escrow are always 
                         recorded within the week.

               Gittes looks a little surprised.

                                     GITTES
                         Then these are all new owners?

                                     CLERK
                         That's right.

                                     GITTES
                              (astonished)
                         But that means that most of the 
                         valley's been sold in the last few 
                         months.

                                     CLERK
                         If that's what it says.

                                     GITTES
                         Can I check one of these volumes 
                         out?

                                     CLERK
                              (quietly snotty)
                         Sir, this is not a lending library, 
                         it's the Hall of Records.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, then, how about a ruler?

                                     CLERK
                         A ruler?

                                     GITTES
                         The print's pretty fine. I forgot my 
                         glasses. I'd like to be able to read 
                         across.

               The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler 
               on the desk.

               Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the 
               book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically.

               INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY

               Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward 
               the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a 
               strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and 
               property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or 
               coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.

               EXT. ROAD  GITTES DRIVING  DAY

               Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying 
               groves, narrower roads.

               He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. There 
               is a "SOLD" sign on the collapsing barn. Gittes stops, checks 
               it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records.

               OLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON

               And a few withered pepper trees. Gittes has paused at this 
               dried-up intersection. There is a "SOLD" sign on a drug store. 
               Gittes looks OFF SCREEN.

               Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud 
               of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.

               Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty yards 
               away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid 
               off it.

               Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth.

               Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.

                                     GITTES
                              (to one of the Children)
                         Say, pal, what's he doing?

                                     CHILD
                         Making some rain.

               Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying 
               himself with the intricacies of his machine. He's aware of 
               Gittes watching him.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, you're just the man I'm looking 
                         for.

               The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual is 
               immaculately dressed.

                                     GITTES
                         Some associates and I are thinking 
                         of buying property out here. Of 
                         course, we're worried about the 
                         rainfall.

               The Rainmaker steps down.

                                     RAINMAKER
                         No problem with me on the Job.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.
                              (glancing around at 
                              the desolate, dry 
                              field)
                         Do you have any references?

                         City of La Habra Heights filled an 
                         800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen 
                         inches of rain in two days.

                                     GITTES

                         Never heard of 'em... new owners?

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                         tell them to get in touch with me if 
                         they want to hang onto their land.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, I'll do that.

               GITTES DRIVING

               Is now covered with a film of dust:

               He reaches a fork in the dirt road. There are a couple of 
               mailboxes.

               Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.

               As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be 
               SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado 
               and walnut groves, their foliage heavy. The few structures 
               in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down 
               to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home. 
               Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.

               Gittes drives through a gate that has "NO TRESPASSING" and 
               "KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY" signs neatly printed on it.

               He drives down the road into the grove.

               GITTES

               Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes. He 
               puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. By contrast 
               with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their 
               heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze.

               Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches of 
               the tree he'd been staring at.

               EXT. AVOCADO GROVES  DAY

               Gittes is shocked. He looks behind him. Riding on horseback 
               down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red-
               Faced Man in overalls. His hat blows off his head. He does 
               not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. Gittes' 
               lane of retreat is denied him. He guns the car, and takes 
               off down one of the orchard lanes.

               MOVING WITH GITTES

               The dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of it, a 
               Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.

               Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the 
               trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here he's pursued 
               by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. Gittes yells at 
               it.

               ANGLE ON GROVE

               Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes 
               toward a dust trail rising above the trees. They've spotted 
               it. Clearly it's from Gittes' car.

               This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one 
               on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and 
               across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator 
               are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.

               Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese 
               and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of 
               the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.

               Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches 
               over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of 
               the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle 
               with. The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back 
               with his crutch. The two of them manage to pound Gittes to 
               the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues 
               to whack away at Gittes with the crutch.

               The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a 
               mule ride up.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         All right, quit it! Quit now! Search 
                         the man, see if he's armed.

               Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger 
               Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. Gittes 
               is badly banged up and half out on his feet. They toss his 
               wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         I said see if he's armed, not empty 
                         his pockets.

                                     BIG FARMER
                         He ain't armed.

               Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         All right, mister. Who you with? 
                         Water department or the real estate 
                         office?

               Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer. He has trouble 
               catching his breath. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in 
               the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Crippled Farmer)
                         Get away from me!

                                     CRIPPLED FARMER
                         Answer him!

                                     GITTES
                         Touch me with that thing again and 
                         you'll need a pair of them.

                                     BIG FARMER
                              (shoving Gittes)
                         Whyn't you pick on somebody your own 
                         size?

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         I said cut that out! Give him a chance 
                         to say something.

               Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer.

                                     GITTES
                              (reaching down for 
                              his wallet)
                         Name's Gittes. I'm a private 
                         investigator and I'm not with either 
                         one.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         Then what are you doing out here?

                                     GITTES
                         Client hired me to see... whether or 
                         not the water department's been 
                         irrigating your land.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         Irrigating my land?
                              (exploding)
                         The water department's been sending 
                         you people to blow up my water tanks! 
                         They threw poison down three of my 
                         wells! I call that a funny way to 
                         irrigate. Who'd hire you for a thing 
                         like that?

               Gittes reaches into his pocket. The paper's on the ground. 
               He picks it up.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

                                     BIG FARMER
                         Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch 
                         who's done it to us.

                                     GITTES
                         Mulwray's dead. You don't know what 
                         you're talking about, you dumb Oakie.

               The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him 
               squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled 
               up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful 
               aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head. 
               Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the 
               Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         Well, that's that.

               BLACK SCREEN

               There's a PURLING SOUND, which soon becomes defined into the 
               SOUND OF VOICES talking quietly  about whether to move or 
               not to move, doctors, etc.

               CLOSE  EVELYN MULWRAY

               Is staring down at Gittes who's lying in the screened in 
               porch of the farmers. His wife, the Red Faced Farmer, and 
               the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog.

               The Red Faced Farmer's wife has set tea out. The farmers, 
               all of them, now seem awkward and a little embarrassed.

               FRONT PORCH  RED FACE FARMER'S HOUSE  REACTION  GITTES  
               DUSK

               He focuses on Evelyn who sits right next to him. He's got 
               dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge 
               mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of 
               spots.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Evelyn)
                         What's going on?

                                     DUBOIS
                              (quietly, almost as 
                              if he were in a 
                              hospital)
                         You didn't look too good, so we 
                         thought we better call your employer.

               Gittes nods. He checks his watch. He looks out. It's almost 
               evening.

               Gittes says nothing. The wife of the Red Faced Farmer (DUBOIS) 
               looks reproachfully at Dubois. Gittes feels the back of his 
               head, It obviously hurts him.

               EXT. DUBOIS FARMHOUSE  EVENING

               Evelyn and Gittes go out to her car, the cream colored 
               Packard.

               Dubois accompanies them, along with the Big Farmer who is 
               carrying a crate of something. Gittes has cleaned himself up 
               a little.

                                     DUBOIS
                         Look here, if it's all the same with 
                         you, we'll get your car patched up. 
                         If you'll tell me what your trousers 
                         run you, I'll make good on them, Mr. 
                         Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         It's okay, Mr. Dubois.

                                     DUBOIS,
                              (to Evelyn)
                         It's just that they're after everybody 
                         out here, tearing up our irrigation 
                         ditches trying to make our land 
                         worthless so they can pick it up for 
                         twenty-five dollars an acre.

               Gittes nods.

                                     DUBOIS
                              (continuing)
                         Anyway. Earl here is sorry, too. He 
                         wants to give you something to take 
                         back with you.

               Gittes looks. Earl has the huge crate he's holding brim-full 
               of avocados.

                                     GITTES
                         Thanks, Earl.

               INT. CAR  EVELYN & GITTES  DUSK

               Evelyn driving.

                                     GITTES
                         Thanks for coming...

               Gittes pulls out cigarette case, takes one, offers one to 
               Evelyn who refuses.

                                     GITTES
                         That dam is a con job.

                                     EVELYN
                         What dam?

                                     GITTES
                         The one your husband opposed. They're 
                         conning L.A. into building it, only 
                         the water won't go to L.A. It'll go 
                         here.

                                     EVELYN
                         The Valley?

                                     GITTES
                         Everything you can see, everything 
                         around us. I was at the Hall of 
                         Records today.
                              (whips out papers, 
                              turns on the car 
                              light)
                         That bother you?

                                     EVELYN
                         No.

                                     GITTES
                              (looking over papers)
                         In the last three months, Robert 
                         Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma 
                         Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 
                         5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 
                         25,000 acres.

                                     EVELYN
                         Jasper Lamar Crabb?

                                     GITTES
                         Know him?

                                     EVELYN
                         No, I think I'd remember.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. They've been blowing these 
                         farmers out of here and buying their 
                         land for peanuts. Have any idea what 
                         this land'll be worth with a steady 
                         water supply? About thirty million 
                         more than they paid.

                                     EVELYN
                         And Hollis knew about it?

                                     GITTES
                         It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar 
                         Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.

               He's pulling out his wallet, excitedly now, spilling its 
               contents onto the seat. He pulls out the obituary column 
               he'd folded up earlier in the day.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         We got it. We got it, baby.

                                     EVELYN
                         What? What is it?

                                     GITTES
                         There was a memorial service at the 
                         Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar 
                         Crabb. He died three weeks ago.

                                     EVELYN
                         Is that unusual?

                                     GITTES
                         Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 
                         acres. That's unusual.

               EXT. MAR VISTA INN AND REST HOME  NIGHT

               Evelyn's car pulls up before the elegant Spanish rest home, 
               its entryway illuminated by streetlights. There is a small 
               sign giving the name of the place in elegant neon scroll. It 
               sits on the rolling green lawns.

               Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn. He offers her his 
               arm and they go up the walkway to the entrance.

               INT. MAR VISTA INN AND REST HOME  NIGHT

               Gittes and Evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in his 
               forties, with a flower in his buttonhole. He sees Evelyn 
               first.

                                     PALMER
                         Hello there, I'm Mr. Palmer. Can I 
                         help you folks?

               Then he gets a clear look at Gittes, bruised, trousers torn, 
               etc.

                                     GITTES
                         Yes, I sure hope so. It's Dad.
                              (indicating his 
                              disheveled appearance)
                         I just can't handle him anymore, can 
                         I, sweetheart?

               Evelyn shakes her head.

                                     PALMER
                         Oh my goodness.

                                     GITTES
                              (hastily)
                         Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, 
                         actually.

                                     EVELYN
                         They just don't get along very well. 
                         Dad's a lamb with anyone else.

                                     PALMER
                              (not so sure)
                         Oh, well, I don't know.

                                     GITTES
                         Naturally, I want the best for him, 
                         money is no object.

                                     PALMER
                         Perhaps if we could meet your father.

                                     GITTES
                         There's just one question.

                                     PALMER
                         Of course.

                                     GITTES
                         Do you accept anyone of the Jewish 
                         persuasion?

               Evelyn can't quite conceal her surprise at the question.

                                     PALMER
                              (very embarrassed)
                         I'm sorry. We don't.

                                     GITTES
                              (smoothly)
                         Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. 
                         Wanted to make sure though, didn't 
                         we, honey?

               Evelyn stares back at Gittes, amused and appalled. She manages 
               to nod.

                                     GITTES
                         Just to be certain, I wonder if you 
                         could show us a list of your patients?

                                     PALMER
                              (polite but pointed)
                         We don't reveal the names of our 
                         guests as a matter of policy. I know 
                         you'd appreciate that if your father 
                         came to live with us.

               Gittes locks eyes with Palmer.

                                     GITTES
                              (confidentially)
                         That's exactly what we wanted to 
                         hear.

                                     PALMER
                         Oh, good.

                                     GITTES
                         I wonder, is it too late for us to 
                         have a look around?

                                     PALMER
                         I don't think so. Be happy to show 
                         you.

                                     GITTES
                         Would you mind if we took a stroll 
                         on our own?

                                     PALMER
                         Just, if you will, confine yourself 
                         to the main building. It's nearly 
                         bedtime.

                                     GITTES
                         We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.

               He takes Evelyn.

               INT. PARLOR  EVELYN

               Looking. Either by accident or design, the primarily 
               octogenarian guests have segregated themselves. In one wing, 
               the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one 
               elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange.

               In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work on a 
               quilt.

               Gittes grabs Evelyn's hand.

                                     GITTES
                              (quietly)
                         They're all here. Every goddam name.

               Gittes points to the wall. It says "ACTIVITIES BOARD". There 
               are titles. "LAWN BOWLING". "BRIDGE". "FISHING". "CROQUET". 
               Below them are the names of the guests, entered under certain 
               activities, for certain days.

               After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; indicating 
                              the ancients around 
                              them)
                         You're looking at the owners of a 
                         50,000 acre empire.

                                     EVELYN
                              (astonished)
                         They can't be.

                                     GITTES
                         They may not know it but they are.

               Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the 
               quilt.

                                     GITTES
                         Hello, girls.

               Two of the ladies giggle. The third continues to busy herself 
               with her quilt, off by herself.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Which one of you is Emma Dill?

               Two of them say "she is," and point in different directions. 
               The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her 
               knitting. Gittes approaches her.

                                     GITTES
                         Are you Emma?

               Some old voice is singing softly, "Don't Sit Under the Apple 
               Tree."

                                     EMMA
                         Yes.

                                     GITTES
                         I've been wanting to meet you.

                                     EMMA
                         Why?

                                     GITTES
                         Did you know that you're a very 
                         wealthy woman?

                                     EMMA
                              (stitching, smiles)
                         I'm not.

                                     GITTES
                         Well you own a lot of land.

                                     EMMA
                         Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my 
                         late husband owned a good deal of 
                         beach property in Long Beach, but we 
                         lost it.

               Gittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among 
               the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it.

                                     GITTES
                         That's just lovely.

                                     EMMA
                         Thank you...

               He looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish, 
               comes across the tail and by it the initials A.C.

                                     GITTES
                              (indicating tail)
                         Where did you get this material?

                                     EMMA
                              (what it sounds like)
                         The apple core club.

                                     GITTES
                         The apple core?

                                     EMMA
                         No. The albacore. It's a fish. My 
                         grandson's a member and they take 
                         very nice care of us.

                                     GITTES
                         How do they do that?

                                     EMMA
                         Give us things. Not just some old 
                         flag like this, but -

                                     GITTES
                              (kneeling)
                         But what?

                                     PALMER'S VOICE
                         We're a sort of unofficial charity 
                         of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you 
                         care to come this way? Someone wants 
                         to see you.

               Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking 
               taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures 
               as if there's someone behind Palmer.

               Gittes rises.

                                     GITTES
                         See you later, Emma.

               He walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in front.

               AT THE ENTRANCE HALL  MULVIHILL

               Is waiting. He's got his hand in his pocket. Evelyn looks to 
               Gittes.

               The four of them stand there, Mulvihill towering over 
               everyone.

                                     MULVIHILL
                         Come on I want you to meet somebody, 
                         Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (glancing from Palmer 
                              to Mulvihill)
                         Can we leave the lady out of this?

                                     MULVIHILL
                              (a little uncertain)
                         Yeah, why not?

                                     GITTES
                         Okay, I'd like to walk her to her 
                         car.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'll stay.

                                     GITTES
                              (taking her by the 
                              arm)
                         Get in the car.

                                     MULVIHILL
                         I'll see she makes it.

               Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake 
               of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back 
               to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's 
               jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket 
               covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating 
               him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly 
               pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red 
               and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.

               Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill's 
               gun has clattered to the floor.

                                     GITTES
                              (as Mulvihill hits 
                              the floor, to Evelyn)
                         What are you waiting for? Get in the 
                         car!

               Evelyn goes.

               Mulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for the 
               gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of his hand 
               and kicks it.

               It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the 
               wall.

               Palmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back 
               to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses.

               Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience 
               of ancients behind him.

               OUTSIDE

               As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops. Two men are coming 
               toward him. One of them is shorter, and has the nervous, 
               jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.

               Gittes stops. The two men fan out and continue to move toward 
               him.

               Gittes spots the two-tone shoes. He begins to back up.

               Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly 
               behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn's car is headed across 
               the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it 
               gets near them. They look in disbelief, then dive for safety. 
               The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass.

               Evelyn opens the passenger door.

                                     EVELYN
                         Get in.

               Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting 
               the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes. Two 
               SHOTS ARE FIRED.

               INT. CAR  EVELYN & GITTES

               Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving. After a moment she 
               takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little. 
               Gittes watches her. He smiles.

               EXT. VERANDA  MULWRAY HOME  NIGHT

               Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, staring 
               off into the night.

               Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with whiskey 
               and an ice bucket on it. She sets it down. Gittes turns.

                                     GITTES
                              (watching her pour)
                         Maid's night off?

                                     EVELYN
                         Why?

                                     GITTES
                              (a little surprised, 
                              he laughs)
                         What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's 
                         here, that's all.

                                     EVELYN
                              (handing Gittes his 
                              drink)
                         I gave everybody the night off.

                                     GITTES
                         Easy, it's an innocent question.

                                     EVELYN
                         No question from you is innocent, 
                         Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (laughing)
                         I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. 
                         Frankly you really saved my a... my 
                         neck tonight.

               They drink.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tell me something. Does this usually 
                         happen to you, Mr. Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     EVELYN
                         Well, I'm only judging on the basis 
                         of one afternoon and an evening, but 
                         if that's how you go about your work, 
                         I'd say you're lucky to get through 
                         a whole day.

                                     GITTES
                              (pouring himself 
                              another drink)
                         Actually this hasn't happened to me 
                         in some time.

                                     EVELYN
                         When was the last time?

                                     GITTES
                         Why?

                                     EVELYN
                         Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.

               Gittes touches his nose, winces a little.

                                     GITTES
                         It was in Chinatown.

                                     EVELYN
                         What were you doing there?

                                     GITTES
                              (taking a long drink)
                         Working for the District Attorney.

                                     EVELYN
                         Doing what?

               Gittes looks sharply at her. Then:

                                     GITTES
                         As little as possible.

                                     EVELYN
                         The District Attorney gives his men 
                         advice like that?

                                     GITTES
                         They do in Chinatown.

               She looks at him. Gittes stares off into the night.

               Evelyn has poured herself another drink.

                                     EVELYN
                         Bothers you to talk about it, doesn't 
                         it?

               Gittes gets up.

                                     GITTES
                         No. I wonder... could I. Do you have 
                         any peroxide or something?

               He touches his nose lightly.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh sure. C'mon.

               She takes his hand and leads him back into the house.

               INT. BATHROOM  MIRROR

               Gittes pulls the plaster off his nose, stares at it in the 
               mirror.

               Evelyn takes some hydrogen peroxide and some cotton out of a 
               medicine cabinet. Evelyn turns Gittes' head toward her. She 
               has him sit on the pullman tile adjacent to the sink.

                                     EVELYN
                         Doctor did a nice job...

               She begins to work on his nose with the peroxide. Then she 
               sees his cheek, checks back in his hair.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing)
                         Boy oh boy, you're a mess.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                                     EVELYN
                              (working on him)
                         So why does it bother you to talk 
                         about it... Chinatown...

                                     GITTES
                         Bothers everybody who works there, 
                         but to me... It was...

               Gittes shrugs.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hold still. Why?

                                     GITTES
                         You can't always tell what's going 
                         on there.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...No. Why was it.

                                     GITTES
                         I thought I was keeping someone from 
                         being hurt and actually I ended up 
                         making sure they were hurt.

                                     EVELYN
                         Could you do anything about it?

               They're very close now as she's going over a mouse very near 
               his eye.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. Make sure I don't find myself 
                         in Chinatown anymore. Wait a second.

               He takes hold of her and pulls her even closer,

                                     EVELYN
                              (momentarily freezing)
                         What's wrong?

                                     GITTES
                         Your eye.

                                     EVELYN
                         What about it?

                                     GITTES
                              (staring intently)
                         There's something black in the green 
                         part of your eye.

                                     EVELYN
                              (not moving)
                         Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...

                                     GITTES
                         ...A flaw...

                                     EVELYN
                              (she almost shivers)
                         ...Yes, sort of a birthmark...

               Gittes kisses her lightly, gradually rises until he's standing 
               holding her. She hesitates, then wraps her arms around him.

               INT. MULWRAY BEDROOM  TELEPHONE

               On a nightstand, city lights visible through the open window 
               behind it. It is RINGING. Evelyn's arm reaches INTO SHOT. 
               SOUND of something hitting the headboard. Gittes moans.

               VIEW SHIFTS TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, holding his head, which 
               he's just hit. Evelyn pauses in her reach to the phone. She 
               turns to him, whispers, "I'm sorry," kisses him on the head 
               and lips. PHONE CONTINUES TO RING. She picks it up.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hello...
                              (in Spanish now)
                         No, no, I'll come and help, just 
                         keep watching her and don't do 
                         anything until I get there... 'bye.

               VIEW SHIFTS AGAIN TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn 
               next to him as she's talking on the phone. She hangs up. She 
               touches Gittes' cheek lightly.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have to go.

               Gittes stares at her silently.

                                     GITTES
                         Where?

                                     EVELYN
                         Just... I have to.

                                     GITTES
                         And I want to know where.

                                     EVELYN
                              (she starts out of 
                              bed)
                         Please don't be angry... believe me, 
                         it's got nothing to do with you.

                                     GITTES
                              (stopping her)
                         Where are you going?

                                     EVELYN
                              (near tears)
                         Please!... Trust me this much...
                              (she kisses him lightly)
                         I'll be back. Look, there is something 
                         I should tell you. The fishing club 
                         that old lady mentioned, the pieces 
                         off the flag.

                                     GITTES
                         The Albacore Club.

                                     EVELYN
                         It has to do with my father.

                                     GITTES
                         I know.

                                     EVELYN
                         He owns it. You know?

                                     GITTES
                         I saw him.

                                     EVELYN
                              (sitting up straight)
                         You saw my fa... father? When?

                                     GITTES
                         This morning.

                                     EVELYN
                              (panicked)
                         You didn't tell me.

                                     GITTES
                         There hasn't been a lot of time.

               She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did he say?
                              (insistent)
                         What did he say?

                                     GITTES
                         That you were jealous, and he was 
                         worried about what you might do.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do? To who?

                                     GITTES
                         Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. 
                         He wanted to know where she was.

               Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and 
               kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand.

                                     EVELYN
                         I want you to listen to me. My father 
                         is a very dangerous man. You don't 
                         know how dangerous. You don't know 
                         how crazy.

                                     GITTES
                         Give me an example.

                                     EVELYN
                         You may think you know what's going 
                         on, but you don't.

                                     GITTES
                         That's what your father said. You're 
                         telling me he's in back of this whole 
                         thing?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's possible.

                                     GITTES
                         Including the death of your husband?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's possible. Please don't ask me 
                         any more questions now. Just wait, 
                         wait for me. I'll be back. I need 
                         you here.

               She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door. Gittes 
               stares at it a moment. Then leaps out of bed, rummages around, 
               tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on. 
               Then hurries out of the bedroom.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOME  GITTES

               Running across the driveway to the garage. There are two 
               cars there.

               Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard.

               Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door.

               INT. BUICK - GITTES

               Checks the ignition. No key is in it. He pulls a couple of 
               wires from under the dash, starts to mess with them, seems 
               satisfied.

               Slides out across the seat, slams the door.

               EXT. MULWRAY DRIVEWAY  NIGHT

               Gittes hurries over to the Packard. He gets down on the 
               driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself. With the heel 
               of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the 
               car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully pulls 
               the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light 
               beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and 
               hurries back toward the house.

               ONE RED AND ONE WHITE TAILLIGHT  MOVING  NIGHT

               Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, 
               the red and white lights coming IN AND OUT OF VIEW.

               GITTES DRIVING  NIGHT

               Behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance 
               from Evelyn in front of him.

               EVELYN'S PACKARD

               Pulls up before a small little bungalow house. She gets out, 
               looks up and down the street. There is nothing. She hurries 
               on up the walkway to the front door.

               DOWN THE STREET  GITTES IN BUICK

               Idles the engine with the lights off. He brings the car a 
               few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's.

               Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The 
               curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on 
               the side of the house.

               He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.

               THROUGH THE WINDOW

               Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living 
               room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges back 
               through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and 
               pitcher on it.

               GITTES

               Around to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery and 
               a short picket fence.

               He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series 
               of windows at the corner of the house. These all have shades 
               on them.

               He can hear someone crying in the house. Someone else talking 
               alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish. Here the 
               windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not 
               completely drawn.

               There's an inch or so of space at the bottom.

               THROUGH THE WINDOW

               Gittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back and 
               forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone 
               rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure 
               is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes 
               INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen 
               with Hollis Mulwray.

               Mulwray's girlfriend. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking 
               in Spanish. Her words are not discernible but the tone is 
               bitter, anguished. A newspaper is strewn about the room.

               Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down some 
               pills.

               The girl reluctantly does.

               GITTES

               Continues to watch.

               EXT. STREET  EVELYN  NIGHT

               Emerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in.

               INT. CAR

               Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at 
               her.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay, give me the keys.

                                     EVELYN
                              (stunned, furious)
                         You bastard.

                                     GITTES
                         It's either that or you drive to the 
                         police yourself.

                                     EVELYN
                         The police?

                                     GITTES
                         C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your 
                         husband's girlfriend tied up in there!

                                     EVELYN
                         She's not tied up!

                                     GITTES
                         You know what I mean. You're keeping 
                         her there against her will.

                                     EVELYN
                         I am not!

                                     GITTES
                         Then let's go talk to her.

               Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm, 
               nearly screaming:

                                     EVELYN
                         No!

               Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn 
               jacket.

               He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming 
               effect on both of them.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing)
                         She's too upset.

                                     GITTES
                         What about?

                                     EVELYN
                         Hollis' death. I tried to keep it 
                         from her, I didn't want her upset 
                         before I could make plans for her to 
                         leave.

                                     GITTES
                         You mean she just found out?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     GITTES
                         That's not what it looks like, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.

                                     EVELYN
                         What does it look like?

                                     GITTES
                         Like she knows about Hollis' death. 
                         Like she knows more than you want 
                         her to tell.

                                     EVELYN
                         You're insane.

               Gittes explodes.

                                     GITTES
                         Just tell me the truth. I'm not the 
                         police. I don't care what you've 
                         done. I'm not going to hurt you, but 
                         one way or another I'm going to know.

                                     EVELYN
                         You won't go to the police if I tell 
                         you?

                                     GITTES
                         I will if you don't.

               A long pause. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, 
               her hair covering her face.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's my sister.

               Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. Not crying, but the 
               kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria. Gittes 
               puts an arm on her shoulder.

                                     GITTES
                         Take it easy... If it's your sister 
                         it's your sister... why all the 
                         secrecy?

               She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely 
               puzzled.

                                     EVELYN
                              (really upset)
                         I can't...

                                     GITTES
                         Because of Hollis? Because she was 
                         seeing your husband? Was that it? 
                         Jesus Christ, say something. Was 
                         that it?

               She nods. Gittes sighs.

                                     EVELYN
                              (finally)
                         I would never ever have harmed Hollis. 
                         I loved him more than my own family. 
                         He was the most gentle, decent man 
                         imaginable... and he put up with 
                         more from me than you'll ever know... 
                         I just wanted him to be happy...

               She begins to cry softly.

                                     GITTES
                              (after a moment)
                         I took your husband's Buick...
                              (he opens the car 
                              door)
                         I'll return it tomorrow.

                                     EVELYN
                         Aren't you coming back with me?

                                     GITTES
                         Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody 
                         about this.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...That's not what I meant.

               There is a long moment of silence. Gittes looks over to 
               Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him.

                                     GITTES
                              (finally)
                         Yeah, well... I'm very tired, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray. Good night.

               He gets out and slams the car door. She drives off.

               INT. SHOWER  GITTES' APARTMENT  GITTES

               The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes 
               is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as 
               the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly 
               for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it.

               INT. GITTES' BEDROOM  GITTES

               Pads around in elegant silk pajamas.

               He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming 
               in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of 
               the covers, inert. Almost immediately the PHONE RINGS. Gittes 
               lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying 
               anything.

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                              (male)
                         Gittes?... Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         Ida Sessions wants to see you.

                                     GITTES
                         Who?

                                     VOICE 0N PHONE
                         Ida Sessions, you remember Ida.

               Gittes slowly rises to one elbow.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah?... I do?

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         Sure you do.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida 
                         wants to see me she can call me at 
                         my office.

               He hangs up, falls back down. PHONE RINGS AGAIN. AND AGAIN. 
               Gittes swears, picks it up.

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         684 1/2 East Tensington. Echo Park. 
                         She begged me to call. She's waiting 
                         for you.

               Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead.

               EXT. CERRITOS TOWER ROAD  HOLLYWOOD HILLS  EARLY MORNING

               Gittes pulls up. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow 
               walkway and sickly green stucco.

               EXT. IDA SESSIONS' APARTMENT  DAY

               Gittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. 
               Nothing. He opens it and enters.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust 
               particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes 
               sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone 
               table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets 
               closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside 
               the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. 
               Gittes walks on into the kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying 
               on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a 
               broken bag.

               Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream 
               of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. 
               She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.

               Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes 
               for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen 
               counter.

               Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her 
               name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, 
               carefully replaces the items in the purse.

               He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, 
               which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves 
               across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Gittes enters and turns on the light.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Find anything interesting, Gittes?

               Escobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the bathroom 
               by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A 
               THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall from the bedroom.

               Gittes looks at the two, doesn't reply.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         What are you doing here?

                                     GITTES
                         Didn't you call?

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (jerk of his head 
                              toward the kitchen)
                         How do you happen to know her?

                                     GITTES
                         I don't.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (turning toward other 
                              room)
                         Let me show you something.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Escobar points to the number "MU 7279" on the side of one of 
               the kitchen cabinets.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Isn't that your number?

                                     GITTES
                         Is it? I forget. I don't call myself 
                         that often.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Just to be on the safe side, we had 
                         Loach here give you a ring.

               He indicates one of his assistants.

                                     ESCOBAR'S ASSISTANT
                              (a slight sneer)
                         What happened to your nose, Gittes? 
                         Somebody slam a bedroom window on 
                         it?

                                     GITTES
                              (right back, smiling)
                         Nope, your wife got excited, crossed 
                         her legs a little too quick. You 
                         understand, pal.

               The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for 
               him.

               Escobar steps between the two.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (to other Assistant)
                         Loach.
                              (Escobar pulls out a 
                              drawer)
                         How about these? Look familiar?

               In the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the girl in 
               the park, boat, and at the El Macando on the veranda.

                                     GITTES
                              (no point in denying 
                              it)
                         Yeah, I took 'em. So what?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         How did she...
                              (meaning the corpse)
                         ...happen to have them?

               Gittes takes a deep breath.

                                     GITTES
                         Either you tell me or I guess 'cause 
                         I don't have the answer.

               Escobar nods.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You really think I'm stupid, don't 
                         you, Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         I don't think about it one way or 
                         the other. But if you want, give me 
                         a day or two, and I'll get back to 
                         you. Now I'd like to go home.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I want the rest of the pictures.

                                     GITTES
                         What pictures?

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (meaning the corpse)
                         This broad hired you, Gittes, not 
                         Evelyn Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down 
                         Mulwray, she hired you, and that's 
                         how you happen to know Mulwray was 
                         murdered.

                                     GITTES
                         I heard it was an accident.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         C'mon, you think you're dealing with 
                         a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had 
                         salt water in his goddam lungs! Now 
                         how did he get that... in a fresh 
                         water reservoir?

               Gittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains 
               nonplussed.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You were following him night and 
                         day. You saw who killed him. You 
                         even took pictures of it. It was 
                         Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying 
                         you off like a slot machine ever 
                         since her husband died.

                                     GITTES
                              (smiling)
                         You accusing me of extortion?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Absolutely.

                                     GITTES
                         I don't think I need a day or two. 
                         You're even dumber than you think I 
                         think you are. Not only that, I'd 
                         never extort a nickel out of my worst 
                         enemy, that's where I draw the line, 
                         Escobar.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Yeah, I once knew a whore who for 
                         enough money would piss in a 
                         customer's face, but she'd never 
                         shit on his chest. That's where she 
                         drew the line.

                                     GITTES
                              (smiling)
                         Well, I hope she wasn't too much of 
                         a disappointment to you, Lou.

               Escobar manages a thin smile.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I want those photographs, Gittes. 
                         We're talking about accessory after 
                         the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. 
                         Minimum.

                                     GITTES
                         Why do you think Mulwray's body was 
                         moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray 
                         knocked off her husband in the ocean 
                         and thought it would look like more 
                         of an accident if she hauled him up 
                         to the Oak Pass Reservoir?

               This is a little telling.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Mulwray was murdered and moved because 
                         somebody didn't want his body found 
                         in the ocean.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         And why's that?

                                     GITTES
                         He found out somebody was dumping 
                         water there. That's what they were 
                         trying to cover up by moving him.

               This stops Escobar. He's dumbfounded by it.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         What are you talking about?

                                     GITTES
                         C'mon I'll show you.

               Escobar hesitates.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're 
                         in charge.

               The men around Escobar look to him. Escobar grudgingly nods.

               CLOSE SHOT  STORM DRAIN

               It yawns AT CAMERA, only a trickle of water dropping into 
               the ocean.

               VIEW WIDENS TO INCLUDE Escobar, Gittes, and two Plain 
               clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if 
               they expect it to talk.

                                     GITTES
                              (squinting in sunlight)
                         It's too late.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Too late for what?

                                     GITTES
                         They only dump the water at night.

               A THIRD ASSISTANT runs down the side of the cliff and Over 
               to Escobar.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Reach anybody?

                                     THIRD ASSISTANT
                         Yelburton, he's the new chief.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I know who he is. Well?

                                     THIRD ASSISTANT
                         He says -

                                     GITTES
                         I know what he says.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (to Gittes)
                         Shut up.
                              (to Assistant)
                         Go on.

                                     THIRD ASSISTANT
                         Yelburton says they're irrigating in 
                         the valley. There's always a little 
                         runoff when they do that. And he 
                         says is Gittes knows that, and has 
                         been going around making irresponsible 
                         accusations for the last week.

               Escobar turns to Gittes. Stares at him for a long moment.

                                     ONE OF ASSISTANTS
                         Let's swear out a warrant for her 
                         arrest. What are we waiting for?

                                     GITTES
                              (meaning Escobar)
                         Because he just made lieutenant, and 
                         he wants to hang onto his little 
                         gold bar.

               Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Have your client in my office in two 
                         hours and remember. I don't have to 
                         let you go. I've got you for 
                         withholding evidence right now.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOME  DAY

               Gittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. He looks 
               in the garage. Evelyn's car is gone. Only the Gardener's 
               truck is there.

               Gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. He 
               rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries 
               it. It's locked.

               He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, 
               takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the 
               lock.

               The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at 
               Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     MAID
                         No esta.

               Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room 
               where luggage is packed and neatly piled.

               The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over 
               the furniture.

                                     GITTES
                              (indicating luggage)
                         Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...
                              (no answer)
                         on a trip?... vacation?...

                                     MAID
                         No esta in casa.

               Gittes nods. He continues through the house and out back to 
               the veranda.

               EXT. MULWRAY VERANDA  GITTES

               Is unsettled. Sees the Gardener working by the pond. He 
               wanders a few yards in that direction.

               GARDENER

               Spots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles.

               GITTES

               In turn, nods, smiles.

                                     GITTES
                         Bad for glass.

               GARDENER

               Breaks into a big grin. Nods again.

                                     GARDENER
                         Oh yes, bad for glass.

               He points to the newly mown lawn.

                                     GARDENER
                              (continuing)
                         Salt water velly bad for glass.

                                     GITTES
                         Can't quite believe what he's heard,

                                     GITTES
                         Salt water?

               The Gardener nods vigorously. Points to the pond.

                                     GARDENER
                         Velly velly bad.

               Gittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the 
               edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd 
               looked closely, a starfish.

               CLOSE STARFISH

               It has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just 
               beginning to grow back.

               GITTES

               Touches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then spots 
               something glinting in the bottom of the pond.

                                     GITTES
                         What's that... down there?

               The Gardener peers into the pond.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         ...there.

               The Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the 
               pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching 
               the water.

               He misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an 
               animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and 
               holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking 
               through the frame where one lens is shattered.

               The Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses. 
               They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.

               INT. MULWRAY HOME

               Gittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone table, 
               lying on his handkerchief are the glasses.

               The Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily 
               watching him.

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         Hello.

                                     GITTES
                         Have you got your checkbook handy, 
                         Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         You've got her? Where?

                                     GITTES
                         Do you remember the figures we 
                         discussed?

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         Of course I do. Where are you?

                                     GITTES
                         At your daughter's house. How soon 
                         can you get here?

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be 
                         there as well?

                                     GITTES
                         Either that or she'll be in jail.

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     GITTES
                         Just bring your checkbook.

               Gittes hangs up.

               EXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE  ADELAIDE DRIVE

               Gittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick. He hurries to the front 
               door, pounds on it.

               The Chinese servant answers the door.

                                     CHINESE SERVANT
                         You wait.

                                     GITTES
                              (short sentence in 
                              Chinese)
                         You wait.

               Gittes pushes past him. Evelyn, looking a little worn but 
               glad to see him hurries to the door. She takes Gittes' arm.

                                     EVELYN
                         How are you? I was calling you.

               She looks at him, searching his face.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah?

               They move into the living room. Gittes is looking around it.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did you get some sleep?

                                     GITTES
                         Sure.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you 
                         something.

                                     GITTES
                              (abruptly)
                         Where's the girl?

                                     EVELYN
                         Upstairs. Why?

                                     GITTES
                         I want to see her.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...she's having a bath now... why do 
                         you want to see her?

               Gittes continues to look around. He sees clothes laid out 
               for packing in a bedroom off the living room.

                                     GITTES
                         Going somewhere?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. 
                         Why?

               Gittes doesn't answer. He goes to the phone and dials.

                                     GITTES
                         J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you doing? What's wrong? I 
                         told you we've got a 4:30.

                                     GITTES
                              (cutting her off)
                         You're going to miss your train!
                              (then, into phone)
                         Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's 
                         above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, 
                         soon as you can.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did you do that for?

                                     GITTES
                              (a moment, then)
                         You know any good criminal lawyers?

                                     EVELYN
                              (puzzled)
                         No...

                                     GITTES
                         Don't worry. I can recommend a couple.
                         They're expensive but you can afford 
                         it.

                                     EVELYN
                              (evenly but with great 
                              anger)
                         What the hell is this all about?

               Gittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his 
               breast pocket. Unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the 
               bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly 
               at them.

                                     GITTES
                         I found these in your backyard... in 
                         your fish pond. They belonged to 
                         your husband, didn't they?... didn't 
                         they?

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't know. I mean yes, probably.

                                     GITTES
                         Yes positively. That's where he was 
                         drowned...

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you saying?

                                     GITTES
                         There's no time for you to be shocked 
                         by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The 
                         coroner's report proves he was killed 
                         in salt water. Just take my word for 
                         it. Now I want to know how it happened 
                         and why. I want to know before Escobar 
                         gets here because I want to hang 
                         onto my license.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about. This is the most insane... 
                         the craziest thing I ever...

               Gittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself. gets up, 
               shakes her.

                                     GITTES
                         Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You 
                         were jealous, you fought, he fell, 
                         hit his head. It was an accident, 
                         but his girl is a witness. You've 
                         had to pay her off. You don't have 
                         the stomach to harm her, but you've 
                         got the money to shut her up. Yes or 
                         no?

                                     EVELYN
                         ...no...

                                     GITTES
                         Who is she? And don't give me that 
                         crap about it being your sister. You 
                         don't have a sister.

               Evelyn is trembling.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'll tell you the truth...

               Gittes smiles.

                                     GITTES
                         That's good. Now what's her name?

                                     EVELYN
                         Katherine.

                                     GITTES
                         Katherine?... Katherine who?

                                     EVELYN
                         She's my daughter.

               Gittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and when 
               Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in the face. 
               Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from 
               her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself.

                                     GITTES
                         I said the truth!

                                     EVELYN
                         She's my sister.

               Gittes slaps her again.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's my daughter.

               Gittes slaps her again.

                                     EVELYN
                         My sister.

               He hits her again.

                                     EVELYN
                         My daughter, my sister.

               He belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase 
               which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing.

                                     GITTES
                         I said I want the truth.

                                     EVELYN
                              (almost screaming it)
                         She's my sister and my daughter!

               Kyo comes running down the stairs.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing; in Chinese)
                         For God's sake, Kyo, keep her 
                         upstairs, go back!

               Kyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes 
               back upstairs.

                                     EVELYN
                         My father and I, understand, or is 
                         it too tough for you?

               Gittes doesn't answer.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...he had a breakdown... the dam 
                         broke... my mother died... he became 
                         a little boy... I was fifteen... 
                         he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, 
                         what clothes to wear!... It 
                         happened... then I ran away...

                                     GITTES
                         To Mexico...

               She nods.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hollis came and took... care of me... 
                         after she was born... he said... he 
                         took care of her... I couldn't see 
                         her... I wanted to but I couldn't...  
                         I just want to see her once in a 
                         while... take care of her... that's 
                         all...  but I don't want her to 
                         know... I don't want her to know...

                                     GITTES
                         ...so that's why you hate him...

               Evelyn looks slowly up at Gittes.

                                     EVELYN
                         No... for turning his back on me 
                         after it happened! He couldn't face 
                         it...
                              (weeping)
                         I hate him.

               Gittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah... where are you taking her 
                         now?

                                     EVELYN
                         Back to Mexico.

                                     GITTES
                         You can't go by train. Escobar'll be 
                         looking for you everywhere.

                                     EVELYN
                         How about a plane?

                                     GITTES
                         That's worse... Just get out of here. 
                         Walk out, leave everything.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have to go home and get my things.

                                     GITTES
                         I'll take care of it.

                         Where can we go?

                                     GITTES
                         ...where does Kyo live?

                                     EVELYN
                         With us.

                                     GITTES
                         On his day off. Get the exact address.

                                     EVELYN
                         Okay...

               She stops suddenly.

                                     EVELYN
                         Those didn't belong to Hollis.

               For a moment Gittes doesn't know what she's talking about. 
               Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his 
               handkerchief.

                                     GITTES
                         How do you know?

                                     EVELYN
                         He didn't wear bifocals.

               Gittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is 
               momentarily lost in them.

               EVELYN

               From the stairs. She has her arm around Katherine.

                                     EVELYN
                         Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (from the stairs)
                         Hello.

                                     GITTES
                         Rises a little shakily from the arm 
                         of the sofa.

                                     GITTES
                         Hello.

               With her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn 
               hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she re-emerges.

                                     EVELYN
                              (calling down)
                         He lives at 1712 Alameda... do you 
                         know where that is?

               REACTION  GITTES

               He nods slowly.

                                     GITTES
                         Sure. It's Chinatown.

               THRU WINDOW

               Of bungalow Gittes watches Evelyn, the girl and Kyo head for 
               Kyo's black dusty sedan.

               Gittes drops the curtain, heads swiftly to the phone. He 
               dials.

                                     GITTES
                         Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, 
                         listen, pal, Escobar's going to try 
                         and book me in about five minutes... 
                         relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the 
                         office for two hours. If you don't 
                         hear from me, you and Duffy meet me 
                         at 1712 Alameda.

                                     WALSH'S VOICE
                         Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't 
                         it?

               The front BELL RINGS.

                                     GITTES
                         I know where it is! Just do it.

               Gittes hangs up and goes to the door. He opens it. No one is 
               there.

                                     GITTES
                              (not even bothering 
                              to look around the 
                              sides)
                         Come on in, Lou. We're both too late.

               Escobar and his minions appear from either side of the door.

                                     GITTES
                         Looks like she flew the coop.

               Escobar nods.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I don't suppose you got any idea 
                         Where she went?

                                     GITTES
                         Matter of fact I do.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Where?

                                     GITTES
                         Her maid's house. I think she knows 
                         something's up.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         What's the maid's address?

                                     GITTES
                         She lives in Pedro. I'll write it 
                         down for you.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         No, Gittes, you'll show us.

                                     GITTES
                         What for?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         If she's not there, you're going 
                         downtown, and you're staying there 
                         til she shows up.

                                     GITTES
                              (deliberately petulant)
                         Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (shoving him toward 
                              the door)
                         Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.

               EXT. SAN PEDRO  29TH STREET  DAY

               A steep hill overlooks part of the harbor. Escobar's unmarked 
               car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched 
               on the steep hillside.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         That's it?

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Well, let's go.

                                     GITTES
                         Do me a favor, will you, Lou?

               Escobar waits.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Let me bring her down myself... she's 
                         not armed or nothing... she won't be 
                         any problem... I'd just like a minute 
                         alone with her... It would mean 
                         something... to...  her... and to 
                         me.

               Escobar shakes his head. For a moment it looks like it means 
               no.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You never learn, do you, Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                              (a little chagrined)
                         I guess not.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Give you three minutes.

                                     GITTES
                         Gee, thanks, Lou.

               Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the 
               stairs. He looks back down at Escobar. Gittes rings the bell. 
               He waits. It opens. It's a WOMAN who's not recognizable. 
               She's got the remnants of a black eye.

                                     WOMAN
                         Yes?...

               Gittes looks past her to Curly, the fisherman from the first 
               scene.

               He's seated at the dinner table with his father, his mother, 
               and his children. Curly looks up in surprise.

                                     CURLY
                              (happily)
                         Mr. Gittes! Come in, come in.

               Gittes enters and closes the door. Curly rises and comes 
               over to him, greets him happily.

                                     CURLY
                         Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Call me Jake. How is everything?

                                     CURLY
                         Just sitting down to supper, Jake. 
                         Care to join us?

                                     GITTES
                         No thanks.

                                     CURLY
                         How about a glass of wine? Honey, 
                         this is...

                                     WIFE
                              (coolly)
                         Yes, I know.

                                     GITTES
                         Thanks just the same, Curly. I could 
                         use a glass of water, though. Come 
                         out with me to the kitchen for a 
                         second.

                                     CURLY
                              (puzzled)
                         Sure thing.

               INT. KITCHEN  GITTES AND CURLY

                                     GITTES
                         Curly, where's your car?

                                     CURLY
                         In the garage.

                                     GITTES
                         Where's that?

                                     CURLY
                         Off the alley.

                                     GITTES
                         Could you drive me somewhere?

                                     CURLY
                         Sure, as soon as we eat.

                                     GITTES
                         Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

                                     CURLY
                         I'll just tell my wife.

                                     GITTES
                              (pulling him out the 
                              back door)
                         Tell her later.

               They head out the back door and down the steps toward the 
               garage.

               EXT. ALLEY AND GARAGE

               Curly pulls open the garage door. Gets in, starts the car, 
               backs it out. It's an old, late twenties Plymouth Sedan. 
               Gittes hops in. They take off. At the edge of the alley Gittes 
               looks back.

               POV FROM CURLY'S CAR

               Escobar is getting out of his car, moving towards the duplex. 
               Gittes slips down in the seat.

                                     GITTES' VOICE
                         Just drive slow for a block or two, 
                         will you, Curly?

                                     CURLY'S VOICE
                         What's this all about?

                                     GITTES' VOICE
                         Tell you in a couple of blocks.

                                     GITTES
                         How much do you owe me, Curly?

                                     CURLY
                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out 
                         tomorrow. I know you been real good 
                         about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.

                                     GITTES
                         Forget it. How would you like to pay 
                         me off by taking a couple of 
                         passengers to Ensenada... you'd have 
                         to leave tonight.

                                     CURLY
                         I don't know...

                                     GITTES
                         I might be able to squeeze an extra 
                         seventy-five bucks out of it for 
                         you. Maybe an even hundred.

                                     CURLY
                         Plus what I owe you?

                                     GITTES
                         I'll throw that in too.

                                     CURLY
                              (smiling)
                         Okay, you got yourself a boat.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOME  GITTES AND CURLY

               Carry bags out to Curly's car. Curly opens the door for the 
               Maid.

               She gets in. He turns to Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half 
                         an hour after you get there. Then if 
                         I don't show, take her down to the 
                         boat.

                                     CURLY
                              (a little worried)
                         You sure this is okay?

                                     GITTES
                              (mildly indignant)
                         Curly, you know how long I been in 
                         business.

               Curly nods, reassured. He gets in and takes off.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOME  DUSK

               By the pond, cigarette smoke drifts INTO SHOT. A car pulls 
               up. In a moment Cross can be SEEN, looking TOWARD CAMERA.

                                     CROSS
                         There you are.

               He walks toward Gittes who stands by the pond, smoking.

                                     CROSS
                              (continuing)
                         Well, you don't look any the worse 
                         for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... 
                         where's the girl?...

                                     GITTES
                         I've got her.

                                     CROSS
                         Is she all right?

                                     GITTES
                         She's fine.

                                     CROSS
                         Where is she?

                                     GITTES
                         With her mother.

               Cross' tone alters here.

                                     CROSS
                         ...with her mother?

               Gittes pulls something out of his pocket and unfolds it.

                                     GITTES
                         I'd like you to look at something, 
                         Mr. Cross.

                                     CROSS
                              (taking it)
                         What is it?

                                     GITTES
                         An obituary column... can you read 
                         in this light?

                                     CROSS
                         Yes... I think I can manage...

               Cross dips into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of 
               rimless glasses.. He puts them on, reads.

               GITTES

               Stares at the bifocal lenses as Cross continues to look 
               through the obituary column. He looks up.

                                     CROSS
                         What does this mean?

                                     GITTES
                         That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

               Gittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now.

                                     GITTES
                         Right here, in this pond. You drowned 
                         him...  and you left these.

               Cross looks at the glasses.

                                     GITTES
                         ...the coroner's report showed Mulwray 
                         had salt water in his lungs.

                                     CROSS
                              (finally)
                         Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. 
                         You know what he used to say about 
                         them?

                                     GITTES
                         Haven't the faintest idea.

                                     CROSS
                         That's where life begins... marshes, 
                         sloughs, tide-pools... he was 
                         fascinated by them...  you know when 
                         we first came out here he figured 
                         that if you dumped water onto desert 
                         sand it would percolate down into 
                         the bedrock and stay there, instead 
                         of evaporating the way it does in 
                         most reservoirs. You'd lose only 
                         twenty percent instead of seventy or 
                         eighty. He made this city.

                                     GITTES
                         And that's what you were going to do 
                         in the Valley?

               EXT. POND  CROSS AND GITTES

                                     CROSS
                              (after a long moment)
                         No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am 
                         doing with the Valley. The bond issue 
                         passes Tuesday. There'll be ten 
                         million to build an aqueduct and 
                         reservoir. I'm doing it.

                                     GITTES
                         There's going to be some irate 
                         citizens when they find out they're 
                         paying for water they're not getting.

                                     CROSS
                         That's all taken care of. You see, 
                         Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the 
                         water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to 
                         the water.

                                     GITTES
                         How do you do that?

                                     CROSS
                         Just incorporate the Valley into the 
                         city so the water goes to L.A. after 
                         all. It's very simple.

               Gittes nods.

                                     GITTES
                              (then)
                         How much are you worth?

                                     CROSS
                              (shrugs, then)
                         I have no idea. How much do you want?

                                     GITTES
                         I want to know what you're worth. 
                         Over ten million?

                                     CROSS
                         Oh, my, yes.

                                     GITTES
                         Then why are you doing it? How much 
                         better can you eat? What can you buy 
                         that you can't already afford?

                                     CROSS
                              (a long moment, then:)
                         The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. 
                         Now where's the girl?... I want the 
                         only daughter I have left... as you 
                         found out, Evelyn was lost to me a 
                         long time ago.

                                     GITTES
                              (with sarcasm)
                         Who do you blame for that? Her?

               Cross makes a funny little cock of his head.

                                     CROSS
                         I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. 
                         Gittes, most people never have to 
                         face the fact that at the right time 
                         and right place, they're capable of 
                         anything. Take those glasses from 
                         him, will you, Claude?

               Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the glasses. 
               Gittes doesn't move.

                                     CROSS
                         It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It's 
                         really not worth it.

               Gittes hands over the glasses.

                                     CROSS
                         Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn 
                         allows me to see her, or I'm not 
                         averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If 
                         I have to buy the jail. Hollis and 
                         Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen 
                         years. It's been too long, I'm too 
                         old.

               EXT. CHINATOWN STREET  NIGHT

               The streets are crowded. Here and there one can see Chinese 
               in traditional dress.

               GITTES

               Driving slowly, spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage, nearly 
               lost in the crowd. They are walking toward a car parked near 
               a laundry truck.

               Gittes sees them, keeps driving.

                                     CROSS
                              (suddenly)
                         Stop the car. Stop the car!

               Mulvihill tries to clobber Gittes. Gittes elbows him. The 
               car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost.

               EXT. STREET  CROSS

               Leaps out of the car shouting:

                                     CROSS
                         Katherine! Katherine! Wait!

               Gittes is after him, grabbing him. Cross tries to swing at 
               Gittes with his cane. Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and 
               the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd 
               scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit 
               Gittes on the side of the head. The three men crash to the 
               pavement.

               CURLY

               Starts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him.

                                     GITTES
                         No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get 
                         'em out of here!

               He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the 
               sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes try for it 
               but someone else has it.

               EVELYN

               Holds the gun. She's shaking but apparently in control of 
               herself.

               GITTES

               Rises to his feet. Mulvihill starts to help Cross up.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, don't help him. Don't do anything.

               Mulvihill doesn't move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn holds 
               the revolver on him.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's gone. It's no good.

                                     CROSS
                         Where?

                                     GITTES
                              (moving to Evelyn)
                         Let me handle that.

                                     EVELYN
                              (to Gittes)
                         I'm all right.

                                     GITTES
                              (she's not)
                         Sure, but I'd like to handle it.

               Evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her.

                                     CROSS
                         You're going to have to kill me, 
                         Evelyn. Either that or tell me where 
                         she is.

               Evelyn is backing up. Cross moving on her. Evelyn cocks the 
               pistol.

                                     CROSS
                         How many years have I got?... she's 
                         mine too.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's never going to know that.

               There's the SOUND of a SIREN. Cross lunges toward her. Gittes 
               grabs Cross.

               Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd. Gittes sees 
               them.

                                     GITTES
                         Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.
                              (to Walsh)
                         Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to 
                         bring the police department with 
                         you.

                                     WALSH
                         Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all 
                         over the place. You oughta know 
                         better.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Walsh, meaning 
                              Cross)
                         Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, 
                         will you?
                              (moving to Evelyn)
                         Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in 
                         Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. 
                         It's the Evening Star. He'll be 
                         waiting. I'll take care of this.

               She looks to Gittes. He looks at her. She turns and he looks 
               at her.

               She turns and Escobar is standing between her and it.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run 
                         around like that.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know 
                         what's going on. Let her go. I'll 
                         explain it later.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious 
                         offense pointing that at an officer 
                         of the law. It's a felony.

                                     GITTES
                         Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (starting toward her)
                         I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                         Lou, she will kill you. Let her go 
                         for now. You don't know.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Gittes, stay outta this.

               Escobar continues to move toward her. Gittes grabs him.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Evelyn)
                         Now take off.

               Evelyn gets in the car. She starts it. Gittes lets Escobar 
               go.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I'll just have her followed. She's 
                         not going anywhere.

               There's a single GUNSHOT. Both men look surprised. Down the 
               block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside his 
               double-parked car.

               Duffy's sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street. 
               It jerks a couple of times, still in gear, then comes to a 
               halt.

               Gittes rushes to the car. He opens it. Evelyn falls out, 
               inert.

               Blood is pouring from her right eye.

                                     GITTES
                              (yelling)
                         No!

               He holds onto Evelyn as Escobar and others hurry up. Cross 
               himself elbows through.

                                     GITTES
                         Where is he? I'll kill him, I'll 
                         kill the son of a bitch.

               Several officers contain Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Escobar)
                         Who is he, get his name? I'll kill 
                         him.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (badly shaken)
                         Take it easy, take it easy, it was 
                         an accident.

                                     GITTES
                         An accident?

               Gittes looks down. What he sees horrifies him. Cross is on 
               the ground, holding Evelyn's body, crying.

                                     GITTES
                         Get him away from her. He's 
                         responsible for everything. Get him 
                         away from her!

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (stunned)
                         Jake, you're very disturbed. You're 
                         crazy. That's her father.

               Walsh and Duffy elbow through the crowd.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (to them)
                         You wanna do your partner the biggest 
                         favor of his life? Take him home. 
                         Just get him the hell out of here!

               Duffy bear hugs the protesting Gittes, along with Walsh, 
               literally dragging him away from the scene, with Gittes trying 
               to shake free.

               Through the crowd noises, Walsh can be heard saying, "Forget 
               it, Jake. It's Chinatown."

          FADE IN:

          EXT. XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE)

          Window, very small in the distance, illuminated.

          All around this is an almost totally black screen.  Now, as 
          the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a 
          postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, 
          cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning 
          sky, enormous iron grille work.  Camera travels up what is now 
          shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the 
          top of it - a huge initial "K" showing darker and darker against 
          the dawn sky.  Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale 
          mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its 
          summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness.

                                     

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL 
          TELLING SOMETHING OF: 

          The literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE.

          Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf 
          Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye 
          can see.  Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and 
          flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when 
          Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly 
          uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good-
          sized mountain, all man-made.  Almost all the land is improved, 
          either through cultivation for farming purposes of through 
          careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.  The 
          castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several 
          genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - 
          dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          GOLF LINKS (MINIATURE)

          Past which we move.  The greens are straggly and overgrown, 
          the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and 
          not seriously tended for a long time.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

                                                               DISSOLVE IN:

          WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE)

          Of the Hagenbeck type.  All that now remains, with one 
          exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on 
          which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other 
          and the landscape at large.  (Signs on several of the plots 
          indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.)

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE)

          In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the 
          dawn murk.  He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, 
          looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the 
          distant light glowing in the castle on the hill.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE)

          The idiot pile of sleepy dragons.  Reflected in the muddy water - 
          the lighted window.

          THE LAGOON (MINIATURE)

          The boat landing sags.  An old newspaper floats on the surface 
          of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer."  As it moves 
          across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the 
          window in the castle, closer than before.

          THE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE)

          It is empty.  A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of 
          the tank.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE COTTAGES (MINIATURE)

          In the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle.  As we 
          move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up 
          and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

                                                               DISSOLVE IN:

          A DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE)

          Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds.  We move 
          across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, 
          perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which 
          extends right up to the very wall of the castle.  The 
          landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a 
          long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in 
          perfect shape.  As the camera makes its way through it, towards 
          the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and 
          exotic blooms of all kinds.  The dominating note is one of 
          almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and 
          despairing.  Moss, moss, moss.  Ankor Wat, the night the last 
          King died.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE WINDOW (MINIATURE)

          Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame 
          of the screen.  Suddenly, the light within goes out.  This 
          stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has 
          been accompanying the sequence.  In the glass panes of the 
          window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. 
          Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN -

          A very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against 
          the enormous window.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE.  

          An incredible one.  Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too 
          picturesque farmhouse and a snow man.  The jingling of sleigh 
          bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to 
          Indian Temple bells - the music freezes -

           

                                    KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE
                        Rosebud...

          The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained 
          in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores 
          all over the world.  A hand - Kane's hand, which has been 
          holding the ball, relaxes.  The ball falls out of his hand and 
          bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera 
          following.  The ball falls off the last step onto the marble 
          floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first 
          rays of the morning sun.  This ray cuts an angular pattern 
          across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of 
          light as the blinds are pulled across the window.

          The foot of Kane's bed.  The camera very close.  Outlined 
          against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of 
          a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head.  The camera 
          follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at 
          the face after the sheet has covered it.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. OF A MOTION PICTURE PROJECTION ROOM

          On the screen as the camera moves in are the words:

                                   "MAIN TITLE"

          Stirring, brassy music is heard on the soundtrack (which, of 
          course, sounds more like a soundtrack than ours.)

          The screen in the projection room fills our screen as the second 
          title appears:

                                    "CREDITS"

          NOTE:  Here follows a typical news digest short, one of the 
          regular monthly or bi-monthly features, based on public events 
          or personalities.  These are distinguished from ordinary 
          newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed 
          editorial or storyline.  Some of the more obvious 
          characteristics of the "March of Time," for example, as well 
          as other documentary shorts, will be combined to give an 
          authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject.  
          As is the accepted procedure in these short subjects, a narrator 
          is used as well as explanatory titles.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          Series of shots showing various aspects of Xanadu, all as they 
          might be photographed by an ordinary newsreel cameraman - nicely 
          photographed, but not atmospheric to the extreme extent of the 
          Prologue (1940).

                                    NARRATOR
                               (dropping the quotes)
                        Here, for Xanadu's landlord, will 
                        be held 1940's biggest, strangest 
                        funeral; here this week is laid to 
                        rest a potent figure of our Century - 
                        America's Kubla Kahn - Charles 
                        Foster Kane.  In journalism's 
                        history, other names are honored 
                        more than Charles Foster Kane's, 
                        more justly revered.  Among 
                        publishers, second only to James 
                        Gordon Bennet the First: his 
                        dashing, expatriate son; England's 
                        Northcliffe and Beaverbrook; 
                        Chicago's Patterson and McCormick;

          TITLE:

          TO FORTY-FOUR MILLION U.S. NEWS BUYERS, MORE NEWSWORTHY THAN 
          THE NAMES IN HIS OWN HEADLINES, WAS KANE HIMSELF, GREATEST 
          NEWSPAPER TYCOON OF THIS OR ANY OTHER GENERATION.

          Shot of a huge, screen-filling picture of Kane.  Pull back to 
          show that it is a picture on the front page of the "Enquirer," 
          surrounded by the reversed rules of mourning, with masthead 
          and headlines. (1940)

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A great number of headlines, set in different types and 
          different styles, obviously from different papers, all 
          announcing Kane's death, all appearing over photographs of 
          Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign 
          languages).  An important item in connection with the headlines 
          is that many of them - positively not all - reveal passionately 
          conflicting opinions about Kane.  Thus, they contain variously 
          the words "patriot," "democrat," "pacifist," "war-monger," 
          "traitor," "idealist," "American," etc.

          followed by shots of special trains with large streamers: "Kane

                        loved, hated, feared, so often 
                        spoken - as Charles Foster Kane.

                        Kane papers scoop the world on the

                        in Kane newsprint no public issue 
                        on which Kane papers took no stand.
                        No public man whom Kane himself 
                        did not support or denounce - often 
                        support, then denounce.  Its humble

                        Kane's empire, in its glory, held 
                        dominion over thirty-seven 
                        newpapers, thirteen magazines, a 
                        radio network.  An empire upon an 
                        empire.  The first of grocery 
                        stores, paper mills, apartment 
                        buildings, factories, forests,
                        ocean-liners - An empire through

                        an unending stream, the wealth of

                        Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 
                        1868 was left the supposedly 
                        worthless deed to an abandoned

                        The magnificent Enquirer Building 
                        of today.

          1891-1911 - a map of the USA, covering the entire screen, which 
          in animated diagram shows the Kane publications spreading from 
          city to city.  Starting from New York, minature newboys speed 
          madly to Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San 
          Francisco, Washington, Atlanta, El Paso, etc., screaming 
          "Wuxtry, Kane Papers, Wuxtry."

          Shot of a large mine going full blast, chimneys belching smoke, 
          trains moving in and out, etc.  A large sign reads "Colorado 
          Lode Mining Co." (1940)  Sign reading; "Little Salem, CO - 25

          An old still shot of Little Salem as it was 70 years ago

                        Fifty-seven years later, before a 
                        Congressional Investigation, Walter 
                        P.  Thatcher, grand old man of 
                        Wall Street, for years chief target 
                        of Kane papers' attack on "trusts," 
                        recalls a journey he made as a 
                        youth...

          Shot of Capitol, in Washington D.C.

          Shot of Congressional Investigating Committee (reproduction of 
          existing J.P. Morgan newsreel).  This runs silent under 
          narration.  Walter P. Thatcher is on the stand.  He is flanked 
          by his son, Walter P. Thatcher Jr., and other partners.  He is 
          being questioned by some Merry Andrew congressmen.  At this 
          moment, a baby alligator has just been placed in his lap, 
          causing considerable confusion and embarrassment.

          Newsreel close-up of Thatcher, the soundtrack of which now 
          fades in.

                        ...  because of that trivial 
                        incident...

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        It is a fact, however, is it not, 
                        that in 1870, you did go to 
                        Colorado?

                                    THATCHER
                        I did.

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        In connection with the Kane affairs?

                                    THATCHER
                        Yes.  My firm had been appointed 
                        trustees by Mrs. Kane for the 
                        fortune, which she had recently 
                        acquired.  It was her wish that I 
                        should take charge of this boy, 
                        Charles Foster Kane.

                        That same month in Union Square -

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        Is it not a fact that on that 
                        occasion, the boy personally 
                        attacked you after striking you in 
                        the stomach with a sled?

          Loud laughter and confusion.

                                    THATCHER
                        Mr. Chairman, I will read to this 
                        committee a prepared statement I 
                        have brought with me - and I will 
                        then refuse to answer any further 
                        questions.  Mr.  Johnson, please!

          A young assistant hands him a sheet of paper from a briefcase.

                                    THATCHER
                               (reading it)
                        "With full awareness of the meaning 
                        of my words and the responsibility 
                        of what I am about to say, it is 
                        my considered belief that Mr.  
                        Charles Foster Kane, in every 
                        essence of his social beliefs and
                        by the dangerous manner in which 
                        he has persistently attacked the 
                        American traditions of private 
                        property, initiative and opportunity 
                        for advancement, is - in fact - 
                        nothing more or less than a 
                        Communist."

          Newsreel of Union Square meeting, section of crowd carrying 
          banners urging the boycott of Kane papers.  A speaker is on 
          the platform above the crowd.

                               soundtrack)
                        - till the words "Charles Foster 
                        Kane" are a menace to every working 
                        man in this land.  He is today 
                        what he has always been and always 
                        will be - A FASCIST!

                                    NARRATOR
                        And yet another opinion - Kane's 
                        own.

          Silent newsreel on a windy platform, flag-draped, in front of 
          the magnificent Enquirer building.  On platform, in full 
          ceremonial dress, is Charles Foster Kane.  He orates silently.

          CHARLES FOSTER KANE.

          Same locale, Kane shaking hands out of frame.

          Another newsreel shot, much later, very brief, showing Kane, 
          older and much fatter, very tired-looking, seated with his 
          second wife in a nightclub.  He looks lonely and unhappy in 
          the midst of the gaiety.

                        Twice married, twice divorced - 
                        first to a president's niece, Emily 
                        Norton - today, by her second 
                        marriage, chatelaine of the oldest 
                        of England's stately homes.  Sixteen 
                        years after that - two weeks after
                        his divorce from Emily Norton - 
                        Kane married Susan Alexander, 
                        singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton,

          Reconstructed silent newsreel.  Kane, Susan, and Bernstein 
          emerging from side doorway of City Hall into a ring of press 
          photographers, reporters, etc.  Kane looks startled, recoils 
          for an instance, then charges down upon the photographers, 
          laying about him with his stick, smashing whatever he can hit.

                                    NARRATOR
                        For wife two, one-time opera singing 
                        Susan Alexander, Kane built 
                        Chicago's Municipal Opera House.  
                        Cost: three million dollars.  
                        Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, 
                        half-finished before she divorced 
                        him, the still unfinished Xanadu.  
                        Cost: no man can say.

          Still of architect's sketch with typically glorified "rendering" 
          of the Chicago Municipal Opera House.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A glamorous shot of the almost-finished Xanadu, a magnificent 
          fairy-tale estate built on a mountain. (1920)

          Then shots of its preparation. (1917)

          Shots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by 
          with tremendous noise.

          Shots of vast dredges, steamshovels.

          Shot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters.

          In quick succession, shots follow each other, some 
          reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from 
          the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc.

                        ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.
                        Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of 
                        the air, the fish of the sea, the 
                        beast of the field and jungle - 
                        two of each; the biggest private 
                        zoo since Noah.  Contents of Kane's 
                        palace: paintings, pictures, 
                        statues, the very stones of many 
                        another palace, shipped to Florida 
                        from every corner of the earth, 
                        from other Kane houses, warehouses, 
                        where they mouldered for years.  
                        Enough for ten museums - the loot 
                        of the world.

          More shots as before, only this time we see (in miniature) a 
          large mountain - at different periods in its development - 
          rising out of the sands.

          Shots of elephants, apes, zebras, etc. being herded, unloaded, 
          shipped, etc. in various ways.

          Shots of packing cases being unloaded from ships, from trains, 
          from trucks, with various kinds of lettering on them (Italian, 
          Arabian, Chinese, etc.) but all consigned to Charles Foster 
          Kane, Xanadu, Florida.

          A reconstructed still of Xanadu - the main terrace.  A group 
          of persons in clothes of the period of 1917.  In their midst, 
          clearly recognizable, are Kane and Susan.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Kane urged his country's entry 
                        into one war, opposed participation 
                        in another.  Swung the election to 
                        one American President at least, 
                        was called another's assassin.  
                        Thus, Kane's papers might never 
                        have survived - had not the 
                        President.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Kane, molder of mass opinion though 
                        he was, in all his life was never 
                        granted elective office by the 
                        voters of his country.  Few U.S. 
                        news publishers have been.
                        Few, like one-time Congressman 
                        Hearst, have ever run for any office - 
                        most know better - conclude with 
                        other political observers that one 
                        man's press has power enough for 
                        himself.  But Kane papers were 
                        once strong indeed, and once the 
                        prize seemed almost his.  In 1910, 
                        as Independent Candidate for 
                        governor, the best elements of the 
                        state behind him - the White House

                        Then, suddenly - less than one 
                        week before election - defeat!  
                        Shameful, ignominious - defeat 
                        that set back for twenty years the 
                        cause of reform in the U.S., forever 
                        cancelled political chances for 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  Then, in the 
                        third year of the Great 
                        Depression...  As to all publishers, 
                        it sometimes must - to Bennett, to 
                        Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper 
                        closes!  For Kane, in four short 
                        years: collapse!

                        in his never-finished, already 
                        decaying, pleasure palace, aloof,

          SHOTS OF XANADU.  (1940)

          Series of shots, entirely modern, but rather jumpy and obviously 
          bootlegged, showing Kane in a bath chair, swathed in summer 
          rugs, being perambulated through his rose garden, a desolate 
          figure in the sunshine.  (1935)

                                    NARRATOR
                        Last week, death came to sit upon 
                        the throne of America's Kubla Khan - 
                        last week, as it must to all men, 
                        death came to Charles Foster Kane.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Cabinent Photograph (Full Screen) of Kane as an old, old man.  
          This image remains constant on the screen (as camera pulls 
          back, taking in the interior of a dark projection room.

          INT. PROJECTION ROOM - DAY -

          A fairly large one, with a long throw to the screen.  It is 
          dark.

          The image of Kane as an old man remains constant on the screen 
          as camera pulls back, slowly taking in and registering 
          Projection Room.  This action occurs, however, only after the 
          first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken.  The 
          shadows of the men speaking appear as they rise from their 
          chairs - black against the image of Kane's face on the screen.

          NOTE:  These are the editors of a "News Digest" short, and of 
          the Rawlston magazines.  All his enterprises are represented 
          in the projection room, and Rawlston himself, that great man, 
          is present also and will shortly speak up.

          During the entire course of this scene, nobody's face is really 
          seen.  Sections of their bodies are picked out by a table light, 
          a silhouette is thrown on the screen, and their faces and bodies 
          are themselves thrown into silhouette against the brilliant 
          slanting rays of light from the projection room.

          A Third Man is on the telephone.  We see a corner of his head 
          and the phone.

                                    THIRD MAN
                               (at phone)
                        Stand by.  I'll tell you if we 
                        want to run it again.
                               (hangs up)

                                    THOMPSON'S VOICE
                        Well?

          A short pause.

                                    A MAN'S VOICE
                        It's a tough thing to do in a 
                        newsreel.  Seventy years of a man's 
                        life -

          Murmur of highly salaried assent at this.  Rawlston walks toward 
          camera and out of the picture.  Others are rising.  Camera 
          during all of this, apparently does its best to follow action 
          and pick up faces, but fails.  Actually, all set-ups are to be 
          planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality 
          from this scene; which is expressed entirely by voices, shadows, 
          sillhouettes and the big, bright image of Kane himself on the 
          screen.

                                    A VOICE
                        See what Arthur Ellis wrote about 
                        him in the American review?

                                    THIRD MAN
                        I read it.

                                    THE VOICE
                               (its owner is already 
                               leaning across the 
                               table, holding a 
                               piece of paper 
                               under the desk 
                               light and reading 
                               from it)
                        Listen:  Kane is dead.  He 
                        contributed to the journalism of 
                        his day - the talent of a 
                        mountebank, the morals of a 
                        bootlegger, and the manners of a 
                        pasha.  He and his kind have almost 
                        succeeded in transforming a once 
                        noble profession into a seven 
                        percent security - no longer secure.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        That's what Arthur Ellis is writing 
                        now.  Thirty years ago, when Kane 
                        gave him his chance to clean up 
                        Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis, 
                        Kane was the greatest guy in the
                        world.  If you ask me -

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        Charles Foster Kane was a...

          Then observations are made almost simultaneous.

                                    RAWLSTON'S VOICE
                        Just a minute!

          Camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow 
          from the projection room.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        What were Kane's last words?

          A silence greets this.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        What were the last words he said 
                        on earth?  Thompson, you've made 
                        us a good short, but it needs 
                        character -

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                        Motivation -

                                    RAWLSTON
                        That's it - motivation.  What made 
                        Kane what he was?  And, for that 
                        matter, what was he?  What we've 
                        just seen are the outlines of a 
                        career - what's behind the career?  
                        What's the man?  Was he good or 
                        bad?  Strong or foolish?  Tragic 
                        or silly?  Why did he do all those 
                        things?  What was he after?
                               (then, appreciating 
                               his point)
                        Maybe he told us on his death bed.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes, and maybe he didn't.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Ask the question anyway, Thompson!
                        Build the picture around the 
                        question, even if you can't answer 
                        it.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I know, but -

                               (riding over him 
                               like any other 
                               producer)
                        All we saw on that screen was a 
                        big American -

                                    A VOICE
                        One of the biggest.

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (without pausing 
                               for this)
                        But how is he different from Ford?
                        Or Hearst for that matter?  Or 
                        Rockefeller - or John Doe?

                                    A VOICE
                        I know people worked for Kane will 
                        tell you - not only in the newspaper 
                        business - look how he raised 
                        salaries.  You don't want to forget -

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        You take his labor record alone, 
                        they ought to hang him up like a 
                        dog.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        I tell you, Thompson - a man's 
                        dying words -

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                        What were they?

          Silence.

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                               (hesitant)
                        Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's 
                        dying words?

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (with disgust)
                        Rosebud!

          A little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced 
          by Rawlston.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        That's right.

                                    A VOICE
                        Tough guy, huh?
                               (derisively)
                        Dies calling for Rosebud!

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Here's a man who might have been 
                        President.  He's been loved and 
                        hated and talked about as much as 
                        any man in our time - but when he 
                        comes to die, he's got something 
                        on his mind called "Rosebud."  
                        What does that mean?

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        A racehorse he bet on once, 
                        probably, that didn't come in - 
                        Rosebud!

                                    RAWLSTON
                        All right.  But what was the race?

          There is a short silence.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Thompson!

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes, sir.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Hold this thing up for a week.  
                        Two weeks if you have to...

                                    THOMPSON
                               (feebly)
                        But don't you think if we release 
                        it now - he's only been dead four 
                        days it might be better than if -

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (decisively)
                        Nothing is ever better than finding 
                        out what makes people tick.  Go 
                        after the people that knew Kane 
                        well.  That manager of his - the 
                        little guy, Bernstein, those two 
                        wives, all the people who knew 
                        him, had worked for him, who loved 
                        him, who hated his guts -
                               (pauses)
                        I don't mean go through the City
                        Directory, of course -

          The Third Man gives a hearty "yes-man" laugh.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'll get to it right away, Mr.
                        Rawlston.

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (rising)
                        Good!

          The camera from behind him, outlines his back against Kane's 
          picture on the screen.

                                    RAWLSTON'S VOICE
                        It'll probably turn out to be a 
                        very simple thing...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          NOTE:  Now begins the story proper - the seach by Thompson for 
          the facts about Kane - his researches ... his interviews with 
          the people who knew Kane.

          It is important to remember always that only at the very end 
          of the story is Thompson himself a personality.  Until then, 
          throughout the picture, we photograph only Thompson's back, 
          shoulders, or his shadow - sometimes we only record his voice.  
          He is not until the final scene a "character".  He is the 
          personification of the search for the truth about Charles Foster 
          Kane.  He is the investigator.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. CHEAP CABARET - "EL RANCHO" - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT - 
          1940 (MINIATURE) - RAIN

          The first image to register is a sign:

          "EL RANCHO"

          FLOOR SHOW

          SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE

          TWICE NIGHTLY

          These words, spelled out in neon, glow out of the darkness at 
          the end of the fade out.  Then there is lightning which reveals 
          a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands.  Thunder again, 
          and faintly the sound of music from within.  A light glows 
          from a skylight.  The camera moves to this and closes in.  
          Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down 
          into the interior of the cabaret.  Directly below us at a table 
          sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCO" CABARET - NIGHT -

          Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink 
          she started to take above.  It is Susie.  The music, of course, 
          is now very loud.  Thompson, his back to the camera, moves 
          into the picture in the close foreground.  A Captain appears 
          behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (a Greek)
                        This is Mr. Thompson, Miss 
                        Alexander.

          Susan looks up into Thompson's face.  She is fifty, trying to 
          look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously 
          generous evening dress.  Blinking up into Thompson's face, she 
          throws a crink into ther mouth.  Her eyes, which she thinks is 
          keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery.

                                    SUSAN
                               (to the Captain)
                        I want another drink, John.

          Low thunder from outside.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (seeing his chance)
                        Right away.  Will you have 
                        something, Mr. Thompson?

                                    THOMPSON
                               (staring to sit 
                               down)
                        I'll have a highball.

                                    SUSAN
                               (so insistently as 
                               to make Thompson 
                               change his mind 
                               and stand up again)
                        Who told you you could sit down 
                        here?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Oh!  I thought maybe we could have 
                        a drink together?

                                    SUSAN
                        Think again!

          There is an awkward pause as Thompson looks from her to the 
          Captain.

                                    SUSAN
                        Why don't you people let me alone?
                        I'm minding my own business.  You 
                        mind yours.

                                    THOMPSON
                        If you'd just let me talk to you 
                        for a little while, Miss Alexander.
                        All I want to ask you...

                                    SUSAN
                        Get out of here!
                               (almost hysterical)
                        Get out!  Get out!

          Thompson looks at the Captain, who shrugs his shoulders.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm sorry.  Maybe some other time -

          If he thought he would get a response from Susan, who thinks 
          she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error.  He 
          nods and walks off, following the Captain out the door.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She's just not talking to anybody 
                        from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm not from a newspaper exactly, 
                        I -

          They have come upon a waiter standing in front of a booth.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (to the waiter)
                        Get her another highball.

                                    THE WAITER
                        Another double?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (after a moment, 
                               pityingly)
                        Yes.

          They walk to the door.

                                    THOMPSON
                        She's plastered, isn't she?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She'll snap out of it.  Why, until 
                        he died, she'd just as soon talk 
                        about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  
                        Sooner.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'll come down in a week or so and 
                        see her again.  Say, you might be 
                        able to help me.  When she used to 
                        talk about Kane - did she ever 
                        happen to say anything - about 
                        Rosebud?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        Rosebud?

          Thompson has just handed him a bill.  The Captain pockets it.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        Thank you, sir.  As a matter of 
                        fact, yesterday afternoon, when it 
                        was in all the papers - I asked 
                        her.  She never heard of Rosebud.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -

          An excruciatingly noble interpretation of Mr. Thatcher himself 
          executed in expensive marble.  He is shown seated on one of 
          those improbable Edwin Booth chairs and is looking down, his 
          stone eyes fixed on the camera.

          We move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on 
          which the monument is founded.  The words, "Walter Parks 
          Thatcher" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon.  
          Immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium 
          shot, the person of Bertha Anderson, an elderly, manish 
          spinnster, seated behind her desk.  Thompson, his hat in his 
          hand, is standing before her.  Bertha is on the phone.

                                    BERTHA
                               (into phone)
                        Yes.  I'll take him in now.
                               (hangs up and looks 
                               at Thompson)
                        The directors of the Thatcher 
                        Library have asked me to remind 
                        you again of the condition under 
                        which you may inspect certain 
                        portions of Mr. Thatcher's 
                        unpublished memoirs.  Under no 
                        circumstances are direct quotations 
                        from his manuscript to be used by 
                        you.

                                    THOMPSON
                        That's all right.

                                    BERTHA
                        You may come with me.

          Without watching whether he is following her or not, she rises 
          and starts towards a distant and imposingly framed door.  
          Thompson, with a bit of a sigh, follows.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -

          A room with all the warmth and charm of Napolean's tomb.

          As we dissolve in, the door opens in and we see past Thompson's 
          shoulders the length of the room.  Everything very plain, very 
          much made out of marble and very gloomy.  Illumination from a 
          skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and 
          classical despair.  The floor is marble, and there is a 
          gigantic, mahogany table in the center of everything.  Beyond 
          this is to be seen, sunk in the marble wall at the far end of 
          the room, the safe from which a guard, in a khaki uniform, 
          with a revolver holster at his hip, is extracting the journal 
          of Walter P. Thatcher.  He brings it to Bertha as if he were 
          the guardian of a bullion shipment.  During this, Bertha has 
          been speaking.

                                    BERTHA
                               (to the guard)
                        Pages eighty-three to one hundred 
                        and forty-two, Jennings.

                                    GUARD
                        Yes, Miss Anderson.

                                    BERTHA
                               (to Thompson)
                        You will confine yourself, it is 
                        our understanding, to the chapter 
                        dealing with Mr. Kane.

                                    THOMPSON
                        That's all I'm interested in.

          The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal.  
          Bertha places it reverently on the table before Thompson.

                                    BERTHA
                        You will be required to leave this 
                        room at four-thirty promptly.

          She leaves.  Thompson starts to light a cigarette.  The guard 
          shakes his head.  With a sigh, Thompson bends over to read the 
          manuscript.  Camera moves down over his shoulder onto page of 
          manuscript.

          Manuscript, neatly and precisely written:

          "CHARLES FOSTER KANE

          WHEN THESE LINES APPEAR IN PRINT, FIFTY YEARS AFTER MY DEATH, 
          I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL AGREE WITH MY OPINION 
          OF CHARLES FOSTER KANE, ASSUMING THAT HE IS NOT THEN COMPLETELY 
          FORGOTTEN, WHICH I REGARD AS EXTREMELY LIKELY.  A GOOD DEAL OF 
          NONSENSE HAS APPEARED ABOUT MY FIRST MEETING WITH KANE, WHEN 
          HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD...  THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE.  IN THE WINTER 
          OF 1870..."

          The camera has not held on the entire page.  It has been 
          following the words with the same action that the eye does the 
          reading.  On the last words, the white page of the paper

                                                            DISSOLVES INTO:

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          The white of a great field of snow, seen from the angle of a 
          parlor window.

          In the same position of the last word in above Insert, appears 
          the tiny figure of Charles Foster Kane, aged five (almost like 
          an animated cartoon).  He is in the act of throwing a snowball 
          at the camera.  It sails toward us and over our heads, out of 
          scene.

          Reverse angle - on the house featuring a large sign reading:

          MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE

          HIGH CLASS MEALS AND LODGING

          INQUIRE WITHIN

          Charles Kane's snowball hits the sign.

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Camera is angling through the window, but the window-frame is 
          not cut into scene.  We see only the field of snow again, same 
          angle as in previous scene.  Charles is manufacturing another 
          snowball.  Now -

          Camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we 
          are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse.  Mrs. Kane, aged 
          about 28, is looking out towards her son.  Just as we take her 
          in she speaks:

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (calling out)
                        Be careful, Charles!

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        Mrs. Kane -

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (Calling out the 
                               window almost on 
                               top of this)
                        Pull your muffler around your neck, 
                        Charles -

          But Charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to 
          this and is running away.  Mrs. Kane turns into camera and we 
          see her face - a strong face, worn and kind.

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        think we'll have to tell him now -

          Camera now pulls back further, showing Thatcher standing before 
          a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing 
          multiplicity of official-looking documents.  He is 26 and, as 
          might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very 
          expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        I'll sign those papers -

                                    KANE SR.
                        You people seem to forget that I'm 
                        the boy's father.

          At the sound of Kane Sr.'s voice, both have turned to him and 
          the camera pulls back still further, taking him in.

          Kane Sr., who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has 
          been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever 
          since daybreak.

          From outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and 
          cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It's going to be done exactly the
                        way I've told Mr. Thatcher -

                                    KANE SR.
                        If I want to, I can go to court.
                        father has a right to -

                                    THATCHER
                               (annoyed)
                        Mr. Kane, the certificates that 
                        Mr.  Graves left here are made out 
                        to Mrs.  Kane, in her name.  Hers 
                        to do with as she pleases -

                                    KANE SR.
                        Well, I don't hold with signing my 
                        boy away to any bank as guardian
                        just because -

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (quietly)
                        I want you to stop all this 
                        nonsense, Jim.

                                    THATCHER
                        The Bank's decision in all matters 
                        concerning his education, his place 
                        of residence and similar subjects 
                        will be final.
                               (clears his throat)

                                    KANE SR.
                        The idea of a bank being the 
                        guardian -

          Mrs. Kane has met his eye.  Her triumph over him finds 
          expression in his failure to finish his sentence.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (even more quietly)
                        I want you to stop all this 
                        nonsense, Jim.

                                    THATCHER
                        We will assume full management of 
                        the Colorado Lode - of which you, 
                        Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.

          Kane Sr. opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, 
          but chokes down his opinion.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (has been reading 
                               past Thatcher's 
                               shoulder as he 
                               talked)
                        Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                        Right here, Mrs. Kane.

                                    KANE SR.
                               (sulkily)
                        Don't say I didn't warn you.

          Mrs. Kane lifts the quill pen.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Mary, I'm asking you for the last 
                        time - anyon'd think I hadn't been
                        a good husband and a -

          Mrs. Kane looks at him slowly.  He stops his speech.

                                    THATCHER
                        The sum of fifty thousand dollars 
                        a year is to be paid to yourself 
                        and Mr. Kane as long as you both 
                        live, and thereafter the survivor -

          Mrs. Kane puts pen to the paper and signs.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Well, let's hope it's all for the 
                        best.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -

          Mrs. Kane, listening to Thatcher, of course has had her other 
          ear bent in the direction of the boy's voice.  Thatcher is 
          aware both of the boy's voice, which is counter to his own, 
          and of Mrs. Kane's divided attention.  As he pauses, Kane Sr. 
          genteelly walks over to close the window.

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Jr., seen from Kane Sr.'s position at the window.  He is 
          advancing on the snowman, snowballs in his hands, dropping to 
          one knee the better to confound his adversary.

                                    KANE
                        If the rebels want a fight boys, 
                        let's give it to 'em!

          He throws two snowballs, missing widely, and gets up and 
          advances another five feet before getting on his knees again.

                                    KANE
                        The terms are underconditional 
                        surrender.  Up and at 'em!  The 
                        Union forever!

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Sr. closes the window.

                                    THATCHER
                               (over the boy's 
                               voice)
                        Everything else - the principal as 
                        well as all monies earned - is to 
                        be administered by the bank in 
                        trust for your son, Charles Foster 
                        Kane, until his twenty-fifth 
                        birthday, at which time he is to 
                        come into complete possession.

          Mrs. Kane rises and goes to the window.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

          Thatcher continues as she opens the window.  His voice, as 
          before, is heard with overtones of the boy's.

          EXT. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Jr., seen from Mrs. Kane's position at the window.  He is 
          now within ten feet of the snowman, with one snowball left 
          which he is holding back in his right hand.

                                    KANE
                        You can't lick Andy Jackson!  Old 
                        Hickory, that's me!

          He fires his snowball, well wide of the mark and falls flat on 
          his stomach, starting to crawl carefully toward the snowman.

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        It's nearly five, Mrs. Kane, don't
                        you think I'd better meet the boy -

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Mrs. Kane at the window.  Thatcher is now standing at her side.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        I've got his trunk all packed -
                               (she chokes a little)
                        I've it packed for a couple of 
                        weeks -

          She can't say anymore.  She starts for the hall day.  Kane 
          Sr., ill at ease, has no idea of how to comfort her.

                                    THATCHER
                        I've arranged for a tutor to meet 
                        us in Chicago.  I'd have brought 
                        him along with me, but you were so
                        anxious to keep everything secret -

          He stops as he realizes that Mrs. Kane has paid no attention 
          to him and, having opened the door, is already well into the 
          hall that leads to the side door of the house.  He takes a 
          look at Kane Sr., tightens his lips and follows Mrs. Kane.  
          Kane, shoulders thrown back like one who bears defeat bravely, 
          follows him.

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane, in the snow-covered field.  With the snowman between him 
          and the house, he is holding the sled in his hand, just about 
          to make the little run that prefaces a belly-flop.  The Kane 
          house, in the background, is a dilapidated, shabby, two-story 
          frame building, with a wooden outhouse.  Kane looks up as he 
          sees the single file procession, Mrs. Kane at its head, coming 
          toward him.

                                    KANE
                        H'ya, Mom.

          Mrs. Kane smiles.

                                    KANE
                               (gesturing at the 
                               snowman)
                        See, Mom?  I took the pipe out of 
                        his mouth.  If it keeps on snowin',
                        maybe I'll make some teeth and -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        You better come inside, son.  You 
                        and I have got to get you all ready
                        for - for -

                                    THATCHER
                        Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

                                    THATCHER
                        How do you do, Charles?

                                    KANE SR.
                        He comes from the east.

                                    KANE
                        Hello.  Hello, Pop.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Hello, Charlie!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Mr. Thatcher is going to take you 
                        on a trip with him tonight, Charles.
                        You'll be leaving on Number Ten.

                                    KANE SR.
                        That's the train with all the 
                        lights.

                                    KANE
                        You goin', Mom?

                                    THATCHER
                        Your mother won't be going right 
                        away, Charles -

                        Where'm I going?

                        You're going to see Chicago and 
                        New York - and Washington, maybe...
                        Isn't he, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                               (heartily)
                        He certainly is.  I wish I were a 
                        little boy and going to make a 
                        trip like that for the first time.

                                    KANE
                        Why aren't you comin' with us, 
                        Mom?

                                    MRS. KANE
                        We have to stay here, Charles.

                                    KANE SR.
                        You're going to live with Mr. 
                        Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  
                        You're going to be rich.  Your Ma 
                        figures - that is, re - she and I 
                        have decided that this isn't the 
                        place for you to grow up in.
                        You'll probably be the richest man 
                        in America someday and you ought 
                        to -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        You won't be lonely, Charles...

                                    THATCHER
                        We're going to have a lot of good 
                        times together, Charles...  Really 
                        we are.

          Kane stares at him.

                                    THATCHER
                        Come on, Charles.  Let's shake 
                        hands.
                               (extends his hand.  
                               Charles continues 
                               to look at him)
                        Now, now!  I'm not as frightening 
                        as all that!  Let's shake, what do 
                        you say?

          He reaches out for Charles's hand.  Without a word, Charles 
          hits him in the stomach with the sled.  Thatcher stumbles back 
          a few feet, gasping.

                                    THATCHER
                               (with a sickly grin)
                        You almost hurt me, Charles.
                               (moves towards him)
                        Sleds aren't to hit people with.
                        Sleds are to - to sleigh on.  When 
                        we get to New York, Charles, we'll
                        get you a sled that will -

          He's near enough to try to put a hand on Kane's shoulder.  As 
          he does, Kane kicks him in the ankle.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Charles!

          He throws himself on her, his arms around her.  Slowly Mrs. 
          Kane puts her arms around him.

                                    KANE
                               (frightened)
                        Mom!  Mom!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It's all right, Charles, it's all 
                        right.

          Thatcher is looking on indignantly, occasionally bending over 
          to rub his ankle.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid 
                        needs is a good thrashing!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        That's what you think, is it, Jim?

                                    KANE SR.
                        Yes.

          Mrs. Kane looks slowly at Mr. Kane.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (slowly)
                        That's why he's going to be brought 
                        up where you can't get at him.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Old-fashioned railroad wheels underneath a sleeper, spinning

          INT. TRAIN - OLD-FASHIONED DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT -

          Thatcher, with a look of mingled exasperation, annoyance, 
          sympathy and inability to handle the situation, is standing 
          alongside a berth, looking at Kane.  Kane, his face in the 
          pillow, is crying with heartbreaking sobs.

                                    KANE
                        Mom!  Mom!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          The white page of the Thatcher manuscript.  We pick up the 
          words:

          "HE WAS, I REPEAT, A COMMON ADVENTURER, SPOILED, UNSCRUPULOUS, 
          IRRESPONSIBLE."

          The words are followed by printed headline on "Enquirer" copy 
          (as in following scene).

          INT. ENQUIRER CITY ROOM - DAY -

          Close-up on printed headline which reads:

          "ENEMY ARMADA OFF JERSEY COAST"

          Camera pulls back to reveal Thatcher holding the "Enquirer" 
          copy, on which we read the headline.  He is standing near the 
          editorial round table around which a section of the staff, 
          including Reilly, Leland and Kane are eating lunch.

                                    THATCHER
                               (coldly)
                        Is that really your idea of how to 
                        run a newspaper?

                                    KANE
                        I don't know how to run a newspaper, 
                        Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything 
                        I can think of.

                                    THATCHER
                               (reading headline 
                               of paper he is 
                               still holding)
                        "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  
                        You know you haven't the slightest 
                        proof that this - this armada - is 
                        off the Jersey Coast.

                                    KANE
                        Can you prove it isn't?

          Bernstein has come into the picture.  He has a cable in his 
          hand.  He stops when he sees Thatcher.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -

                        How are you, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                        How do you do? -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr. 
                        Kane -

                                    KANE
                        That's all right.  We have no 
                        secrets from our readers.  Mr. 
                        Thatcher is one of our most devoted 
                        readers, Mr.  Bernstein.  He knows 
                        what's wrong with every issue since 
                        I've taken charge.  What's the 
                        cable?

                        The food is marvelous in Cuba the 
                        senoritas are beautiful stop I 
                        could send you prose poems of palm 
                        trees and sunrises and tropical 
                        colors blending in far off

                        You see!  There hasn't been a true 
                        word -

                                    KANE
                        I think we'll have to send our 
                        friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. 
                        Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have 
                        to make it shorter than his, because 
                        he's working on an expense account 
                        and we're not.  Let me see -
                               (snaps his fingers)
                        Mike!

                                    MIKE
                               (a fairly tough 
                               customer prepares 
                               to take dictation, 
                               his mouth still 
                               full of food)
                        Go ahead, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Dear Wheeler -
                               (pauses a moment)
                        You provide the prose poems - I'll 
                        provide the war.

          Laughter from the boys and girls at the table.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        That's fine, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        I rather like it myself.  Send it 
                        right away.

                                    MIKE
                        Right away.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Right away.

          Mike and Bernstein leave.  Kane looks up, grinning at Thatcher, 
          who is bursting with indignation but controls himself.  After 
          a moment of indecision, he decides to make one last try.

                                    THATCHER
                        I came to see you, Charles, about 
                        your - about the Enquirer's campaign 
                        against the Metropolitan Transfer 
                        Company.

                                    KANE
                        Won't you step into my office, Mr.
                        Thatcher?

          They cross the City Room together.

                                    THATCHER
                        I think I should remind you, 
                        Charles, of a fact you seem to 
                        have forgotten.  You are yourself 
                        one of the largest individual 
                        stockholders.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Kane holds the door open for Thatcher.  They come in together.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything 
                        I've been saying in the Enquirer 
                        about the traction trust absolutely 
                        true?

                                    THATCHER
                               (angrily)
                        They're all part of your general
                        attack - your senseless attack -
                        on everything and everybody who's 
                        got more than ten cents in his 
                        pocket.  They're -

                                    KANE
                        The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you 
                        don't realize you're talking to
                        two people.

          Kane moves around behind his desk.  Thatcher doesn't understand, 
          looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        As Charles Foster Kane, who has                         
                        eighty-two thousand, six hundred 
                        and thirty-one shares of 
                        Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I 
                        do have a rough idea of my holdings -
                        I sympathize with you.  Charles 
                        Foster Kane is a dangerous 
                        scoundrel, his paper should be run 
                        out of town and a committee should 
                        be formed to boycott him.  You 
                        may, if you can form such a 
                        committee, put me down for a 
                        contribution of one thousand 
                        dollars.

                        Charles, my time is too valuable 
                        for me -

                        On the other hand -
                               (his manner becomes 
                               serious)
                        I am the publisher of the Enquirer.
                        As such, it is my duty - I'll let 
                        you in on a little secret, it is 
                        also my pleasure - to see to it 
                        that decent, hard-working people 
                        of this city are not robbed blind 
                        by a group of money - mad pirates 
                        because, God help them, they have 
                        no one to look after their 
                        interests!  I'll let you in on 
                        another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  
                        I think I'm the man to do it.  You 
                        see, I have money and property -

          Thatcher doesn't understand him.

                                    KANE
                        If I don't defend the interests of 
                        the underprivileged, somebody else 
                        will - maybe somebody without any 
                        money or any property and that 
                        would be too bad.

          Thatcher glares at him, unable to answer.  Kane starts to dance.

                                    KANE
                        Do you know how to tap, Mr. 
                        Thatcher?  You ought to learn -
                               (humming quietly, 
                               he continues to 
                               dance)

          Thatcher puts on his hat.

                                    THATCHER
                        I happened to see your consolidated 
                        statement yesterday, Charles.  
                        Could I not suggest to you that it 
                        is unwise for you to continue this 
                        philanthropic enterprise -
                               (sneeringly)
                        this Enquirer - that is costing 
                        you one million dollars a year?

                                    KANE
                        You're right.  We did lose a million 
                        dollars last year.

          Thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered.

                                    KANE
                        We expect to lost a million next
                        year, too.  You know, Mr. Thatcher -
                               (starts tapping 
                               quietly)
                        at the rate of a million a year -
                        we'll have to close this place in 
                        sixty years.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY

          Thompson - at the desk.  With a gesture of annoyance, he is 
          closing the manuscript.

          Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on 
          door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to 
          confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him 
          out.  Very prominent on this wall is an over-sized oil painting 
          of Thatcher in the best Union League Club renaissance style.

                                    MISS ANDERSON
                        You have enjoyed a very rare 
                        privilege, young man.  Did you 
                        find what you were looking for?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No.  Tell me something, Miss 
                        Anderson.  You're not Rosebud, are 
                        you?

                                    MISS ANDERSON
                        What?

                                    THOMPSON
                        I didn't think you were.  Well, 
                        thanks for the use of the hall.

          He puts his hat on his head and starts out, lighting a cigarette 
          as he goes.  Miss Anderson, scandalized, watches him.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER SKYSCRAPER - DAY -

          Closeup of a still of Kane, aged about sixty-five.  Camera 
          pulls back, showing it is a framed photograph on the wall.  
          Over the picture are crossed American flags.  Under it sits 
          Bernstein, back of his desk.  Bernstein, always an undersized 
          Jew, now seems even smaller than in his youth.  He is bald as 
          an egg, spry, with remarkably intense eyes.  As camera continues 
          to travel back, the back of Thompson's head and his shoulders 
          come into the picture.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (wryly)
                        Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman 
                        of the Board.  I got nothing but 
                        time ...  What do you want to know?

                                    THOMPSON
                               (still explaining)
                        Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with 
                        Mr.  Kane from the very beginning -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        From before the beginning, young 
                        fellow.  And now it's after the 
                        end.
                               (turns to Thompson)
                        Anything you want to know about 
                        him - about the paper -

                                    THOMPSON
                        -  We thought maybe, if we can 
                        find out what he meant by that 
                        last word - as he was dying -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  
                        There were a lot of them back in 
                        the early days, and -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Not some girl he knew casually and 
                        then remembered after fifty years,
                        on his death bed -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You're pretty young, Mr. -
                               (remembers the name)
                        Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will 
                        remember things you wouldn't think 
                        he'd remember.  You take me.  One 
                        day, back in 1896, I was crossing 
                        over to Jersey on a ferry and as 
                        we pulled out, there was another
                        ferry pulling in -
                               (slowly)
                        - and on it, there was a girl 
                        waiting to get off.  A white dress 
                        she had on - and she was carrying 
                        a white pastrol - and I only saw 
                        her for one second and she didn't 
                        see me at all - but I'll bet a 
                        month hasn't gone by since that I 
                        haven't thought of that girl.
                               (triumphantly)
                        See what I mean?
                               (smiles)
                        Well, so what are you doing about 
                        this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm calling on people who knew Mr. 
                        Kane.  I'm calling on you.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who else you been to see?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well, I went down to Atlantic City -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Susie?  I called her myself the 
                        day after he died.  I thought maybe 
                        somebody ought to...
                               (sadly)
                        She couldn't even come to the 
                        'phone.

                                    THOMPSON
                        You know why?  She was so -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sure, sure.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm going back there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who else did you see?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Nobody else, but I've been through 
                        that stuff of Walter Thatcher's.
                        That journal of his -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Thatcher!  That man was the biggest
                        darn fool I ever met -

                                    THOMPSON
                        He made an awful lot of money.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        It's not trick to make an awful 
                        lot of money if all you want is to 
                        make a lot of money.
                               (his eyes get 
                               reflective)
                        Thatcher!

          Bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming 
          to see something as he talks.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He never knew there was anything 
                        in the world but money.  That kind 
                        of fellow you can fool every day 
                        in the week - and twice on Sundays!
                               (reflectively)
                        The time he came to Rome for Mr. 
                        Kane's twenty-fifth birthday...  
                        You know, when Mr. Kane got control 
                        of his own
                        money...  Such a fool like Thatcher -
                        I tell you, nobody's business!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          Bernstein speaking to Thompson.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane 
                        did, and he got it!  Thatcher never 
                        did figure him out.  He was hard 
                        to figure sometimes, even for me.  
                        Mr. Kane was a genius like he said.  
                        He had that funny sense of humor.  
                        Sometimes even I didn't get the 
                        joke.  Like that night the opera 
                        house of his opened in Chicago...  
                        You know, the opera house he built 
                        for Susie, she should be an opera 
                        singer...
                               (indicates with a 
                               little wave of his

                               of that; sighing)
                        That was years later, of course - 
                        1914 it was.  Mrs. Kane took the 
                        leading part in the opera, and she 
                        was terrible.  But nobody had the 
                        nerve to say so - not even the 
                        critics.  Mr. Kane was a big man 
                        in those days.  But this one fellow, 
                        this friend of his, Branford Leland -

          INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          It is late.  The room is almost empty.  Nobody is at work at 
          the desks.  Bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little 
          group of Kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with 
          overcoats and hats.  Eveybody is tense and expectant.

                        What about Branford Leland?  Has 
                        he got in his copy?

                        Go in and ask him to hurry.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein?
                        You know Mr. Leland.

                               moment; then slowly)
                        I might make him nervous.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                               (after a pause)
                        You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you 
                        were great friends back in the old 
                        days, I understand.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (with a smile)
                        That's right.  They called us the 
                        "Three Musketeers."

          Somebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter.  
          The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        He's a great guy - Leland.
                               (another little 
                               pause)
                        Why'd he ever leave New York?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (he isn't saying)
                        That's a long story.

                                    ANOTHER HIRELING
                               (a tactless one)
                        Wasn't there some sort of quarrel 
                        between -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (quickly)
                        I had nothing to do with it.
                               (then, somberly)
                        It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and 
                        you couldn't call it a quarrel 
                        exactly.  Better we should forget 
                        such things -
                               (turning to City 
                               Editor)
                        Leland is writing it up from the 
                        dramatic angle?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes.  I thought it was a good idea.
                        We've covered it from the news 
                        end, of course.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        And the social.  How about the 
                        music notice?  You got that in?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Oh, yes, it's already made up.  
                        Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Enthusiastic?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, very!
                               (quietly)
                        Naturally.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, well - isn't that nice?

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Mr. Bernstein -

          Bernstein turns.

          Medium long shot of Kane, now forty-nine, already quite stout.  
          He is in white tie, wearing his overcoat and carrying a folded 
          opera hat.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hello, Mr. Kane.

          The Hirelings rush, with Bernstein, to Kane's side.  Widespread, 
          half-suppressed sensation.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!

                                    KANE
                        We've got a nice plant here.

          Everybody falls silent.  There isn't anything to say.

                                    KANE
                        Was the show covered by every 
                        department?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Exactly according to your 
                        instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got 
                        two spreads of pictures.

                                    KANE
                               (very, very casually)
                        And the notice?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes - Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        Is it good?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, Mr. kane.

          Kane looks at him for a minute.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        But there's another one still to 
                        come - the dramatic notice.

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        It isn't finished?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        No, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        That's Leland, isn't it?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Has he said when he'll finish?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        We haven't heard from him.

                                    KANE
                        He used to work fast - didn't he, 
                        Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He sure did, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Where is he?

                                    ANOTHER HIRELING
                        Right in there, Mr. Kane.

          The Hireling indicates the closed glass door of a little office 
          at the other end of the City Room.  Kane takes it in.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (helpless, but very 
                               concerned)
                        MR. KANE -

                                    KANE
                        That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.

          Kane crosses the length of the long City Room to the glass 
          door indicated before by the Hireling.  The City Editor looks 
          at Bernstein.  Kane opens the door and goes into the office, 
          closing the door behind him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't 
                        spoke together for ten years.
                               (long pause; finally)
                        Excuse me.
                               (starts toward the 
                               door)

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Bernstein comes in.  An empty bottle is standing on Leland's 
          desk.  He has fallen over his typewriter, his face on the keys.  
          A sheet of paper is in the machine.  A paragraph has been typed.  
          Kane is standing at the other side of the desk looking down on 
          him.  This is the first time we see murder in Kane's face.  
          Bernstein looks at Kane, then crosses to Leland.  He shakes 
          him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hey, Brad!  Brad!
                               (he straightens, 
                               looks at Kane; 
                               pause)
                        He ain't been drinking before, Mr. 
                        Kane.  Never.  We would have heard.

                                    KANE
                               (finally; after a 
                               pause)
                        What does it say there?

          Bernstein stares at him.

                                    KANE
                        What's he written?

          Bernstein looks over nearsightedly, painfully reading the 
          paragraph written on the page.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (reading)
                        "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty 
                        but hopelessly incompetent amateur -
                               (he waits for a 
                               minute to catch 
                               his breath; he 
                               doesn't like it)
                        - last night opened the new Chicago 
                        Opera House in a performance of - 
                        of -"
                               (looks up miserably)
                        I can't pronounce that name, Mr. 
                        Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thais.

          Bernstein looks at Kane for a moment, then looks back, tortured.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (reading again)
                        "Her singing, happily, is no concern 
                        of this department.  Of her acting, 
                        it is absolutely impossible to..."
                               (he continues to 
                               stare at the page)

                                    KANE
                               (after a short 
                               silence)
                        Go on!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (without looking up)
                        That's all there is.

          Kane snatches the paper from the roller and reads it for 
          himself.  Slowly, a queer look comes over his face.  Then he 
          speaks, very quietly.

                                    KANE
                        Of her acting, it is absolutely 
                        impossible to say anything except 
                        that it represents a new low...
                               (then sharply)
                        Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein?
                        In the opinion of this reviewer -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (miserably)
                        I didn't see that.

                                    KANE
                        It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm 
                        dictating it.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him)
                        I can't take shorthand.

                                    KANE
                        Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish 
                        the notice.

          Bernstein retreats from the room.

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Long shot of Kane in his shirt sleeves, illuminated by a desk 
          light, typing furiously.  As the camera starts to pull even 
          farther away from this, and as Bernstein - as narrator - begins 
          to speak -

                                                            QUICK DISSOLVE:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Bernstein speaking to Thompson.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He finished it.  He wrote the worst 
                        notice I ever read about the girl 
                        he loved.  We ran it in every paper.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (after a pause)
                        I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so 
                        well of Susie's art anyway.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him very 
                               soberly)
                        He thought she was great, Mr. 
                        Thompson.  He really believed that.  
                        He put all his ambition on that 
                        girl.  After she came along, he 
                        never really cared for himself 
                        like he used to.  Oh, I don't
                        blame Susie -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well, then, how could he write 
                        that roast?  The notices in the 
                        Kane papers were always very kind 
                        to her.

                        Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell 
                        you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard 
                        man to figure out.  He had that 
                        funny sense of humor.  And then, 
                        too, maybe he thought by finishing 
                        that piece he could show Leland he 
                        was an honest man.  You see, Leland 
                        didn't think so.  I guess he showed 
                        him all right.  He's a nice fellow, 
                        but he's a dreamer.  They were 
                        always together in those early 
                        days when we just started the 
                        Enquirer.

          On these last words, we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          The front half of the second floor constitutes one large City 
          Room.  Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of 
          it is actually getting into the room because the windows are 
          small and narrow.  There are about a dozen tables and desks, 
          of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters.  
          Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, 
          obviously serve the city room executives.  To the left of the 
          platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum.

          As Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on 
          the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight 
          occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new 
          arrivals.  Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises 
          and starts toward them.

                                    CARTER
                        Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the 
                        "Enquirer."  I am Herbert Carter.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr.
                        Leland.

                                    CARTER
                               (bowing)
                        How do you do, Mr. Leland?

                                    KANE
                               (pointing to the 
                               standing reporters)
                        Are they standing for me?

                                    CARTER
                        I thought it would be a nice gesture
                        the new publisher -

                                    KANE
                               (grinning)
                        Ask them to sit down.

                                    CARTER
                        You may resume your work, gentlemen.
                               (to Kane)
                        I didn't know your plans and so I 
                        was unable to make any preparations.

                                    KANE
                        I don't my plans myself.

          They are following Carter to his raised platform.

                                    KANE
                        As a matter of fact, I haven't got 
                        any.  Except to get out a newspaper.

          There is a terrific crash at the doorway.  They all turn to 
          see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance.  A roll of bedding, a 
          suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

          Bernstein looks up.

                                    KANE
                        If you would come here a moment,
                        please, Mr. Bernstein?

          Bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.
                        Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.

                                    CARTER
                               (frigidly)
                        How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    KANE
                        You've got a private office here, 
                        haven't you?

          The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance 
          with parts of the bedstead and other furniture.  He is looking 
          about, a bit bewildered.

                                    CARTER
                               (indicating open 
                               door to left of 
                               platform)
                        My little sanctum is at your 
                        disposal.  But I don't think I 
                        understand -

                                    KANE
                        I'm going to live right here.
                               (reflectively)
                        As long as I have to.

                                    CARTER
                        But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane.
                        After all, we're practically closed 
                        twelve hours a day - except for 
                        the business offices -

                                    KANE
                        That's one of the things I think 
                        must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The 
                        news goes on for twenty-four hours 
                        a day.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - LATE DAY -

          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll-top desk in the Sanctum, 
          is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal 
          at the same time.  Carter, still formally coated, is seated 
          alongside him.  Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, 
          detached, amused.  The furniture has been pushed around and 
          Kane's effects are somewhat in place.  On a corner of the desk, 
          Bernstein is writing down figures.  No one pays any attention 
          to him.

                                    KANE
                        I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, 
                        but here's what I mean.  There's a 
                        front page story in the "Chronicle,"
                               (points to it)
                        and a picture - of a woman in 
                        Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably 
                        murdered.
                               (looks to make sure 
                               of the name)
                        A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why 
                        didn't the "Enquirer" have that 
                        this morning?

                                    CARTER
                               (stiffly)
                        Because we're running a newspaper, 
                        Mr.  Kane, not a scandal sheet.

          Kane has finished eating.  He pushes away his plates.

                                    KANE
                        I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go 
                        to Rector's and get something 
                        decent.
                               (pointing to the 
                               "Chronicle" before 
                               him)
                        The "Chronicle" has a two-column 
                        headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't 
                        we?

                                    CARTER
                        There is no news big enough.

                                    KANE
                        If the headline is big enough, it 
                        makes the new big enough.  The 
                        murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -

                                    CARTER
                               (hotly)
                        As a matter of fact, we sent a man 
                        to the Silverstone home yesterday 
                        afternoon.
                               (triumphantly)
                        Our man even arrived before the 
                        "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's 
                        no proof that the woman was murdered -
                        or even that she's dead.

                                    KANE
                               (smiling a bit)
                        The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's 
                        murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the 
                        neighbors are getting suspicious.

                                    CARTER
                               (stiffly)
                        It's not our function to report 
                        the gossip of housewives.  If we 
                        were interested in that kind of 
                        thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the 
                        paper twice over daily -

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        That's the kind of thing we are 
                        going to be interested in from now 
                        on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish 
                        you'd send your best man up to see 
                        Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell 
                        Mr.  Silverstone if he doesn't 
                        produce his wife at once, the 
                        "Enquirer" will have him arrested.
                               (he gets an idea)
                        Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's 
                        a detective from the Central Office.
                        If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his 
                        badge, your man is to get indignant 
                        and call Mr. Silverstone an 
                        anarchist.

          Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.

                                    CARTER
                        Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the
                        function of a respectable newspaper -

          Kane isn't listening to him.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

          Bernstein looks up from his figures.

                                    KANE
                        I've just made a shocking discovery.
                        The "Enquirer" is without a 
                        telephone.  Have two installed at 
                        once!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        I ordered six already this morning!
                        Got a discount!

          Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at Bernstein.  
          Leland grins back.  Mr. Carter, meantime, has risen stiffly.

                                    CARTER
                        But, Mr. Kane -

                                    KANE
                        That'll be all today, Mr. Carter.
                        You've been most understanding.
                        Good day, Mr. Carter!

          Carter, with a look that runs just short of apoplexy, leaves 
          the room, closing the door behind him.

                                    LELAND
                        Poor Mr. Carter!

                                    KANE
                               (shakes his head)
                        What makes those fellows think 
                        that a newspaper is something rigid, 
                        something inflexible, that people
                        are supposed to pay two cents for -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (without looking up)
                        Three cents.

                                    KANE
                               (calmly)
                        Two cents.

          Bernstein lifts his head and looks at Kane.  Kane gazes back 
          at him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (tapping on the 
                               paper)
                        This is all figured at three cents 
                        a copy.

                                    KANE
                        Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at 
                        two cents.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (sighs and puts 
                               papers in his pocket)
                        All right, but I'll keep these 
                        figures, too, just in case.

                                    KANE
                        Ready for dinner, Brad?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should 
                        decide to drop the price to one 
                        cent, or maybe even he should make 
                        up his mind to give the paper away 
                        with a half-pound of tea - you'll 
                        just hold him until I get back, 
                        won't you?

                                    LELAND
                        I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr.
                        Bernstein.  You people work too 
                        fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who said anything about brooms?

                                    KANE
                        It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A 
                        new broom sweeps clean.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Oh!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT.PRIMITIVE COMPOSING AND PRESSROOM - NEW YORK ENQUIRER - 
          NIGHT -

          The ground floor witht he windows on the street - of the 
          "Enquirer."  It is almost midnight by an old-fashioned clock 
          on the wall.  Grouped around a large table, on which are several 
          locked forms of type, very old-fashioned of course, but true 
          to the period - are Kane and Leland in elegant evening clothes, 
          Bernstein, unchanged from the afternoon, and Smathers, the 
          composing room foreman, nervous and harassed.

                                    SMATHERS
                        But it's impossible, Mr. Kane.  We 
                        can't remake these pages.

                                    KANE
                        These pages aren't made up as I 
                        want them, Mr. Smathers.  We go to 
                        press in five minutes.

                                    CARTER
                               (about to crack up)
                        The "Enquirer" has an old and 
                        honored tradition, Mr. Kane...  
                        The "Enquirer" is not in competition 
                        with those other rags.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        We should be publishing such rags,
                        that's all I wish.  Why, the 
                        "Enquirer" - I wouldn't wrap up 
                        the liver for the cat in the 
                        "Enquirer" -

                                    CARTER
                               (enraged)
                        Mr. Kane, I must ask you to see to 
                        it that this - this person learns 
                        to control his tongue.

          Kane looks up.

                                    CARTER
                        I've been a newspaperman my whole 
                        life and I don't intend -
                               (he starts to sputter)
                        - if it's your intention that I 
                        should continue to be harassed by 
                        this - this -
                               (he's really sore)
                        I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go 
                        against my grain to desert you 
                        when you need me so badly - but I 
                        would feel obliged to ask that my 
                        resignation be accepted.

                                    KANE
                        It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with 
                        assurances of my deepest regard.

                                    CARTER
                        But Mr. Kane, I meant -

          Kane turns his back on him, speaks again to the composing room 
          foreman.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        Let's remake these pages, Mr. 
                        Smathers.  We'll have to publish a 
                        half hour late, that's all.

                                    SMATHERS
                               (as though Kane 
                               were talking Greek)
                        We can't remake them, Mr. Kane.  
                        We go to press in five minutes.

          Kane sighs, unperturbed, as he reaches out his hand and shoves 
          the forms off the table onto the floor, where they scatter 
          into hundreds of bits.

                                    KANE
                        You can remake them now, can't 
                        you, Mr. Smathers?

          Smather's mouth opens wider and wider.  Bradford and Bernstein 
          are grinning.

                                    KANE
                        After the types 've been reset and 
                        the pages have been remade according 
                        to the way I told you before, Mr.
                        Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled 
                        and bring them to me.  Then, if I 
                        can't find any way to improve them
                        again -
                               (almost as if 
                               reluctantly)
                        - I suppose we'll have to go to 
                        press.

          He starts out of the room, followed by Leland.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (to Smathers)
                        In case you don't understand, Mr.
                        Smathers - he's a new broom.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The picture is mainly occupied by a large building, on the 
          roof of which the lights spell out the word "Enquirer" against 
          the sunrise.  We do not see the street or the first few stories 
          of this building, the windows of which would be certainly 
          illuminated.  What we do see is the floor on which is located 
          the City Room.  Over this scene, newboys are heard selling the 
          Chronicle, their voices growing in volume.

          As the dissolve complete itself, camera moves toward the one 
          lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter 
          but very insistent.

          Kane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the 
          Enquirer building.

          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking 
          out.  The bed is already made up.  On it is seated Bernstein, 
          smoking the end of a cigar.  Leland is in a chair.

                                    NEWSBOYS' VOICES
                        CHRONICLE!  CHRONICLE!  H'YA - THE 
                        CHRONICLE - GET YA!  CHRONICLE!

          Kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window 
          and turns to the others.  The voices of the newsboys, naturally, 
          are very much fainter after this.

                                    LELAND
                        We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - 
                        another ten minutes.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking at his 
                               watch)
                        It's three hours and fifty minutes
                        late - but we did it -

          Leland rises from the chair, stretching painfully.

                                    KANE
                        Tired?

                                    LELAND
                        It's been a tough day.

                                    KANE
                        A wasted day.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking up)
                        Wasted?

                                    LELAND
                               (incredulously)
                        Charlie?!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You just made the paper over four
                        times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -

                                    KANE
                        I've changed the front page a 
                        little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not 
                        enough - There's something I've 
                        got to get into this paper besides 
                        pictures and print -  I've got to 
                        make the "New York Enquirer" as 
                        important to New York as the gas 
                        in that light.

                                    LELAND
                               (quietly)
                        What're you going to do, Charlie?

          Kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy 
          concentration.

                                    KANE
                        My Declaration of Principles -
                               (he says it with 
                               quotes around it)
                        Don't smile, Brad -
                               (getting the idea)
                        Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -

                                    KANE
                        I'll write it myself.

          Kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon.  Sitting 
          down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking over his 
                               shoulder)
                        You don't wanta make any promises, 
                        Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.

                                    KANE
                               (as he writes)
                        These'll be kept.
                               (stops for a minute 
                               and reads what he 
                               has written; reading)
                        I'll provide the people of this 
                        city with a daily paper that will 
                        tell all the news honestly.
                               (starts to write 
                               again; reading as 
                               he writes)
                        will also provide them -

                                    LELAND
                        That's the second sentence you've
                        started with "I" -

                                    KANE
                               (looking up)
                        People are going to know who's 
                        responsible.  And they're going to
                        get the news - the true news -
                        quickly and simply and 
                        entertainingly.
                               (he speaks with 
                               real conviction)
                        And no special interests will be 
                        allowed to interfere with the truth 
                        of that news.

          He looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, 
          reading as he writes.

          Bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane.  They 
          both stand looking out.  Leland joins him on the other side.  
          Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky.  Leland's 
          head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - 
          camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their 
          eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.  
          Bernstein is still smoking a cigar.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page of the "Enquirer" shows big boxed editorial with 
          heading:

          MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE

          Camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the 
          top of a pile of newspapers.  As we draw further back, we see 
          four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six 
          piles and go on back until we see a big field of "Enquirers" - 
          piles of "Enquirers" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution.

          A wagon with a huge sign on its side reading

          "ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000"

          passes through foreground, and we wipe to:

          A pile of "Enquirers" for sale on a broken down wooden box on 
          a street corner, obviously a poor district.  A couple of coins 
          fall on the pile.

          The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can 
          and a bag of rolls.  Across the sidewalk before this, moves 
          the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front 
          wheel.  A copy of the "Enquirer" is tossed on the stoop.

          A breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - 
          everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine.  Into a 
          silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the "Enquirer".  
          Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A 
          DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the 
          front page.

          The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and 
          dark as a train behind the camera rushes by.  On the floor, 
          there is tossed a bound bundle of the "New York Enquirer" - 
          the Declaration of Principles still prominent.

          Rural Delivery - a copy of the "Enquirer"s being put into bins, 
          showing state distribution.

          The railroad platform again.  We stay here for four images.  
          On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles 
          of the "Enquirer" are larger.  On the first image, we move in 
          to hold on the words "CIRCULATION - 31,000."  We are this close 
          for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 
          55,000, and the last which is 62,000.  In each instance, the 
          bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving 
          train behind the camera is increased.

          The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a 
          descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New 
          York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; 
          bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters 
          (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform 
          is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train.

          The last figure "62,000" opposite the word "CIRCULATION" on 
          the "Enquirer" masthead changes to:

          EXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY -

          Angle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting 
          the last zero to the figure "62,000" on an enormous sign 
          advertising the "Enquirer."  It reads:

          THE ENQUIRER  THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER  CIRCULATION 62,000

          Camera travels down side of building - takes in another building 
          on which there is a sign which reads:

          READ THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  CIRCULATION 62,000

          Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the 
          Chronicle office.  The Chronicle office has a plateglass window 
          in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, 
          also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching 
          peanuts.

          Inside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of 
          the "Chronicle" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the 
          center.  A sign over the photo reads: EDITORIAL AND EXECUTIVE 
          STAFF OF THE NEW YORK CHRONICLE.  A sign beneath it reads: 
          GREATEST NEWSPAPER STAFF IN THE WORLD.  The sign also includes 
          the "Chronicle" circulation figure.  There are nine men in the 
          photo.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking up at the 
                               sign - happily)
                        Sixty-two thousand -

                                    LELAND
                        That looks pretty nice.

                                    KANE
                               (indicating the 
                               Chronicle Building)
                        Let's hope they like it there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        From the Chronicle Building that 
                        sign is the biggest thing you can 
                        see - every floor guaranteed - 
                        let's hope it bothers them - it 
                        cost us enough.

                                    KANE
                               (pointing to the 
                               sign over the 
                               photograph in the 
                               window)
                        Look at that.

                                    LELAND
                        The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.

                                    KANE
                        It's a good idea for a newspaper.
                               (reading the figures)
                        Four hundred sixy thousand.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Say, with them fellows -
                               (referring to the 
                               photo)
                        - it's no trick to get circulation.

                                    KANE
                        You're right, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (sighs)
                        You know how long it took the 
                        "Chronicle" to get that staff 
                        together?  Twenty years.

                                    KANE
                        I know.

          Kane, smiling, lights a cigarette, at the same time looking 
          into the window.  Camera moves in to hold on the photograph of 
          nine men, still holding the reflection of Kane's smiling face.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Nine men, arrayed as in the photograph, but with Kane beaming 
          in the center of the first row.  The men, variously with 
          mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc. are easily identified as 
          being the same men, Reilly prominent amongst them.

          As camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being 
          photographed - by an old-type professional photographer, big 
          box, black hood and all - in a corner of the room.  It is 1:30 
          at night.  Desks, etc. have been pushed against the wall.  
          Running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, 
          at which twenty diners have finished their meals.  The eleven 
          remaining at their seats - these include Bernstein and Leland - 
          are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        That's all.  Thank you.

          The photographic subjects rise.

                                    KANE
                               (a sudden thought)
                        Make up an extra copy and mail it 
                        to the "Chronicle."

          Chuckling and beaming, he makes his way to his place at the 
          head of the table.  The others have already sat down.  Kane 
          gets his guests' attention by rapping on the table with a knife.

                                    KANE
                        Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This 
                        has, I think, been a fitting welcome
                        to those distinguished journalists -
                               (indicates the eight 
                               men)
                        Mr. Reilly in particular - who are 
                        the latest additions to our ranks.
                        It will make them happy to learn 
                        that the "Enquirer's" circulation 
                        this morning passed the two hundred 
                        thousand mark.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Two hundred and one thousand, six 
                        hundred and forty-seven.

          General applause.

                                    KANE
                        All of you - new and old -  You're 
                        all getting the best salaries in 
                        town.  Not one of you has been 
                        hired because of his loyalty.  
                        It's your talent I'm interested 
                        in.  That talent that's going to 
                        make the "Enquirer" the kind of 
                        paper I want - the best newspaper 
                        in the world!

          Applause.

                                    KANE
                        However, I think you'll agree we've 
                        heard enough about newspapers and 
                        the newspaper business for one 
                        night.  There are other subjects 
                        in the world.

          He puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill 
          whistle.  This is a signal.  A band strikes up a lively ditty 
          of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very 
          magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the 
          chorus costumes of the day.  The rest of this episode will be 
          planned and staged later.  Its essence is that Kane is just a 
          healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time.

          As some of the girls are detached from the line and made into 
          partners for individual dancing -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          THE "ENQUIRER" SIGN:  THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  
          CIRCULATION 274,321

          Dissolve just completes itself - the image of Kane dancing 
          with a girl on each arm just disappears as camera pans down 
          off the Temple Bldg. in the same action as the previous street 
          scene.  There is a new sign on the side of the building below.  
          It reads:

          READ THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD

          Camera continues panning as we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A montage of various scenes, between the years 1891-1900.

          The scenes indicate the growth of the "Enquirer" under the 
          impulse of Kane's personal drive.  Kane is shown, thus, at 
          various activities:

          Move down from the sign: READ THE ENQUIRER  GREATEST STAFF IN 
          THE WORLD to street in front of saloon with parade passing 
          (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)-  A torchlight 
          parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the 
          saloon - the sound of brass band playing "It's a Hot Time."  
          In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster "REMEMBER 
          THE MAINE"

          INSERT:  Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the 
          parade above, in which "Our Boys" in the expeditionary hats 
          are seen marching off to war.

          Back of observation car.  Shot of Kane congratulating Teddy 
          Roosevelt (the same shot as in the News Digest - without 
          flickering).

          The wooden floor of the railroad platform again - a bundle of 
          "Enquirers" - this time an enormous bundle - is thrown down, 
          and the moving shadows of the train behind the camera indicate 
          that it is going like a bat out of hell.  A reproduction of 
          Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the 
          frame and almost hogs the entire front page.  The headline 
          indicates the surrender of Cuba.

          INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE

          Cartoon, highly dramatic and very involved as to content - 
          lousy with captions, labels, and symbolic figures, the most 
          gruesome and recognizable - "Capitalistic Greed."  This cartoon 
          is almost finished and is on a drawing board before which stand 
          Kane and the artist himself.  Kane is grinning over some 
          suggestion he has made.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          The cartoon finished and reproduced on the editorial page of 
          the "Enquirer" - in quite close, with an editorial and several 
          faces of caps shown underneath.  The entire newspaper is crushed 
          with an angry gesture and thrown down into an expensive-looking 
          wastebasket (which is primarily for ticker tape) tape is 
          pouring.

          INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE

          Cartoonist and Kane working on comic strip of "Johnny the Monk."

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Floor of room -  Two kids on floor, with newspaper spread out, 
          looking at the same comic strip.

          Kane's photographic gallery with photographers, stooges, and 
          Kane himself in attendance on a very hot-looking item of the 
          period.  A sob sister is interviewing this hot number and Kane 
          is arranging her dress to look more seductive.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          The hot number reproduced and prominently displayed and covering 
          almost half a page of the "Enquirer."  It is being read in a 
          barber shop and is seen in an over-shoulder shot of the man 
          who is reading it.  He is getting a shine, a manicure, and a 
          haircut.  The sob-sister caption over the photograph reveals: 
          "I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING, SAYS DANCER.  EVERYTHING WENT 
          RED."  An oval photograph of the gun is included in the lay-
          out of the pretty lady with a headline which says: "DEATH GUN."

          STREET - SHOT OF BUCKET BRIGADE

          Shot of Kane, in evening clothes, in obvious position of danger, 
          grabbing camera from photographer.  Before him rages a terrific 
          tenement fire.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INSERT:  Headline about inadequacy of present fire equipment.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Final shot of a new horse-drawn steam engine roaring around a 
          street corner (Stock).

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A black pattern of iron bars.  We are in a prison cell.  The 
          door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and 
          the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the 
          hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob-
          sister, and Kane.  The photographers take pictures with a mighty 
          flash of old-fashioned flash powder.  The condemned man in the 
          foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A copy of the "Enquirer" spread out on a table.  A big lay-out 
          of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by 
          Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a 
          large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock 
          shot) with a headline indicating that the "Enquirer" has won 
          its campaign for better equipment.  A cup of coffee and a 
          doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose 
          shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee.

          The Beaux Art Ball.  A number of elderly swells are jammed 
          into a hallway.  Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, 
          overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress 
          costume, pink fleshings, etc., the effect to be very surprising, 
          very lavish and very very ridiculous.  We see, among others, 
          Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head 
          and all.  At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes 
          and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of 
          the "New York Enquirer."

          Over the "Enquirer"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball 
          is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a 
          pretty repulsive sight.

          The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can.

          Extreme close-up of the words: "OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST."

          Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page 
          which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality.  
          Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport.

          EXT. CUNARD DOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -

          As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, 
          Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing 
          ocean liner.  Behind the principles can be seen an enormous 
          plain sign which reads: "FIRST CLASS."  From offstage can be 
          heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any Mercury 
          production, the old familiar cry, "All Ashore That's Going 
          Ashore!" - gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the 
          rest of it.

                                    THE OFFICIAL
                        There you are, Mr. Kane.  Everything 
                        in order.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you.

          Kane and Leland and Bernstein start up the gangplank.

                                    THE OFFICIAL
                               (calling)
                        Have a good rest, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

                        But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy 
                        any more paintings.  Nine Venuses 
                        already we got, twenty-six Virgins - 
                        two whole warehouses full of stuff -

                                    KANE
                        I promise not to bring any more 
                        Venuses and not to worry - and not 
                        to try to get in touch with any of
                        the papers -

                                    KANE
                        - and to forget about the new 
                        feature sections - and not to try 
                        to think up and ideas for comic 
                        sections.

                        All ashore that's going ashore!

          Kane leaves Leland and Bernstein midway up gangplank, as he 
          rushes up to it, calling back with a wave:

                                    KANE
                        Goodbye, gents!
                               (at the top of the 
                               gangplank, he turns 
                               and calls down)
                        Hey!

                                    KANE
                               (calling down to 
                               them)
                        You don't expect me to keep any of 
                        those promises, do you?

          A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne."  Bernstein and 
          Leland turn to each other.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Do you, Mr. Leland?

                                    LELAND
                               (smiling)
                        Certainly not.

          They start down the gangplank together.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          LONG SHOT OF THE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT

          The pattern of telegraph wires, dripping with rain, through 
          which we see the same old building but now rendered fairly 
          remarkable by tremendous outline sign in gold which reads "THE 
          NEW YORK DAILY ENQUIRER."  A couple of lights show in the 
          building.  We start toward the window where the lights show, 
          as we -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AT BERNSTEIN'S DESK - NIGHT

          The light in the window in the former shot was showing behind 
          the letter "E" of the Enquirer sign.  Now the letter "E" is 
          even larger than the frame of the camera.  Rain drips 
          disconsolately off the middle part of the figure.  We see 
          through this and through the drizzle of the window to 
          Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded 
          light.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          Same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and 
          late in the winter of the year.  The outline "E" is hung with 
          icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us 
          and Mr. Bernstein, still seated at his desk - still working.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Same setup as before except that it is spring.  Instead of the 
          sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the 
          melancholy cry of a hurdy-gurdy in the street below.  It is 
          spring and through the letter "E" we can see Bernstein working 
          at his desk.  Pigeons are gathering on the "E" and on the sill.  
          Bernstein looks up and sees them.  He takes some crumbs from 
          his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before 
          him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking 
          moodily out on the prospect of spring on Park Row.  The birds 
          eat the crumbs - the hurdy-gurdy continues to play.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          The same setup again, it is now summer.  The window was half-
          open before .. now it's open all the way and Bernstein has 
          gone so far as to take off his coat.  His shirt and his 
          celluloid collar are wringing wet.  Camera moves toward the 
          window to tighten on Bernstein and to take in the City Room 
          behind him, which is absolutely deserted.  It is clear that 
          there is almost nothing more for Bernstein to do.  The hurdy-
          gurdy in the street is playing as before, but a new tune.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A beach on Coney Island.

          Bernstein in a rented period bathing suit sits alone in the 
          sand, reading a copy of the "Enquirer."

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          The whole floor is now a City Room.  It is twice its former 
          size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using 
          them.  The windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal 
          more light and air.  A wall calendar says September 9th.

          Kane and Bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment.  
          Kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear-
          eyed and tanned.  He is wearing new English clothes.  As they 
          come into the room, Bernstein practically walking sideways, is 
          doing nothing but beaming and admiring Kane, quelling like a 
          mother at the Carnegie Hall debut of her son.  Seeing and 
          recognizing Kane, the entire staff rises to its feet.

                                    KANE
                               (referring to the 
                               staff; with a smile)
                        Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sit down, everybody - for heaven's 
                        sake!

          The order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business 
          of feverish activity.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        So then, tonight, we go over 
                        everything thoroughly, eh?  
                        Especially the new papers -

                                    KANE
                        We certainly do.  Vacation's over -
                        starting right after dinner.  But
                        right now - that lady over there -
                               (he indicates a 
                               woman at the desk)
                        - that's the new society editor, I 
                        take it?  You think I could 
                        interrupt her a moment, Mr. 
                        Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been 
                        away so long I forgot about your
                        joking -

          He trails after Kane as he approaches the Society Editor's 
          desk.  The Society Editor, a middle-aged spinster, sees him 
          approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend 
          she isn't aware of him.  An envelope in her hand shakes 
          violently.  Kane and Bernstein stop at her desk.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Miss Townsend -

          Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein 
          with a stranger.

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                        Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.

          Miss Townsend can't stick to her plan.  She starts to rise, 
          but her legs are none too good under her.  She knocks over a 
          tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up.

                                    KANE
                               (very hesitatingly 
                               and very softly)
                        Miss Townsend -

          At the sound of his voice, she straightens up.  She is very 
          close to death from excitement.

                                    KANE
                        I've been away for several months, 
                        and I don't know exactly how these 
                        things are handled now.  But one 
                        thing I wanted to be sure of is 
                        that you won't treat this little 
                        announcement any differently than 
                        you would any other similar 
                        announcement.

          He hands her an envelope.  She has difficulty in holding on to 
          it.

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        Read it, Miss Townsend.  And 
                        remember - just the regular 
                        treatment!  See you at nine o'clock, 
                        Mr. Bernstein!

          Kane leaves.  Bernstein looks after him, then at the paper.  
          Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope.  A piece 
          of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward.

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                               (reading)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton 
                        announce the engagement of their 
                        daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to 
                        Mr.  Charles Foster Kane.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (starts to read it)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton
                        announce -

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                               (fluttering - on 
                               top of him)
                        She's - she's the niece of - of 
                        the President of the United States -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (nodding proudly)
                        know.  Come on, Miss Townsend -
                        From the window, maybe we can get 
                        a look.

          He takes her by the hand and leads her off.

          Angle toward open window.  Bernstein and Miss Townsend, backs 
          to camera, rushing to the window.

          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          High angle downward - what Bernstein and Miss Townsend see 
          from the window.

          Kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch, drawn up at the 
          curb, in which sits Miss Emily Norton.  He kisses her full on 
          the lips before he sits down.  She acts a bit taken aback, 
          because of the public nature of the scene, but she isn't really 
          annoyed.  As the barouche starts off, she is looking at him 
          adoringly.  He, however, has turned his head and is looking 
          adoringly at the "Enquirer."  He apparently sees Bernstein and 
          Miss Townsed and waves his hand.

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER - DAY -

          Bernstein and Miss Townsend at window.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        A girl like that, believe me, she's 
                        lucky!  Presiden't niece, huh!  
                        Say, before he's through, she'll 
                        be a Presiden't wife.

          Miss Townsend is now dewey-eyed.  She looks at Bernstein, who 
          has turned away, gazing down at the departing couple.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page of the "Enquirer."  Large picture of the young couple - 
          Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - DAY -

          Bernstein and Thompson.  As the dissolve comes, Bernstein's 
          voice is heard.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        The way things turned out, I don't 
                        need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton 
                        was no rosebud!

                                    THOMPSON
                        It didn't end very well, did it?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (shaking his head)
                        It ended -
                               (a slight pause)
                        Then there was Susie - that ended, 
                        too.
                               (shrugs, a pause; 
                               then looking up 
                               into Thompson's 
                               eyes)
                        guess he didn't make her very happy -

                                    (A PAUSE)
                        You know, I was thinking - that 
                        Rosebud you're trying to find out 
                        about -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Maybe that was something he lost.  
                        Mr. Kane was a man that lost - 
                        almost everything he had -
                               (a pause)
                        You ought to talk to Bradford 
                        Leland.  He could tell you a lot.  
                        I wish I could tell you where Leland 
                        is, but I don't know myself.  He 
                        may be out of town somewhere - he 
                        may be dead.

                                    THOMPSON
                        In case you'd like to know, Mr.
                        Bernstein, he's at the Huntington 
                        Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You don't say!  Why I had no idea -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Nothing particular the matter with
                        him, they tell me.  Just -
                               (controls himself)

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Just old age.
                               (smiles sadly)
                        It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, 
                        you don't look forward to being 
                        cured of.
                               (pauses)
                        You ought to see Mr. Leland.  
                        There's a whole lot of things he 
                        could tell you - if he wanted to.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Close shot - Thompson.  He is tilted back in a chair which 
          seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney.  Leland's voice 
          is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen.

                                    LELAND'S VOICE
                        When you get to my age, young man, 
                        you don't miss anything.  Unless 
                        maybe it's a good drink of bourbon.
                        Even that doesn't make much 
                        difference, if you remember there 
                        hasn't been any good bourbon in 
                        this country for twenty years.

          Camera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that 
          Leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to 
          Thompson.  They are on the flat roof of a hospital.  Other 
          people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along 
          with a nurse or two.  They are all sunning themselves.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Mr. Leland, you were -

                                    LELAND
                        You don't happen to have a cigar, 
                        do you?  I've got a young physician - 
                        must remember to ask to see his 
                        license - the odds are a hundred 
                        to one he hasn't got one - who 
                        thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  
                        I changed the subject, didn't I?  
                        Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable 
                        old man I've become.  You want to 
                        know what I think of Charlie Kane?  
                        Well - I suppose he has some private 
                        sort of greatness.  But he kept it 
                        to himself.
                               (grinning)
                        He never - gave himself away -  He
                        never gave anything away.  He just -
                        left you a tip.  He had a generous 
                        mind.  I don't suppose anybody 
                        ever had so many opinions.  That 
                        was because he had the power to 
                        express them, and Charlie lived on 
                        power and the excitement of using 
                        it -  But he didn't believe in
                        anything except Charlie Kane.  He 
                        never had a conviction in his life.  
                        I guess he died without one -  
                        That must have been pretty 
                        unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of 
                        us check out with no special 
                        conviction about death.  But we do 
                        know what we're leaving ... we 
                        believe in something.
                               (looks sharply at 
                               Thompson)
                        You're absolutely sure you haven't 
                        got a cigar?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sorry, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        Never mind -  Bernstein told you 
                        about the first days at the office, 
                        didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a 
                        bad newspaper man even then.  He 
                        entertained his readers, but he 
                        never told them the truth.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Maybe you could remember something
                        that -

                                    LELAND
                        I can remember everything.  That's 
                        my curse, young man.  It's the 
                        greatest curse that's ever been 
                        inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  
                        I was his oldest friend.
                               (slowly)
                        As far as I was concerned, he 
                        behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' 
                        his friend.  If I wasn't, he never 
                        had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays
                        you call a stooge -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          The party (previously shown in the Bernstein sequence).

          We start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but 
          from a fresh angle, holding on Leland, who is at the end of 
          the table.  Kane is heard off, making a speech.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Not one of you has been hired 
                        because of his loyalty.  It's your 
                        talent I'm interested in.  That 
                        talent that's going to make the 
                        "Enquirer" the kind of paper I 
                        want - the best newspaper in the 
                        world!

          Applause.  During above, Bernstein has come to Leland's side.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!

                                    LELAND
                        Yes.

          His tone causes Bernstein to look at him.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        However, I think you'll agree we've 
                        heard enough about newspapers and 
                        the newspaper business for one 
                        night.

          The above speeches are heard under the following dialogue.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (to Leland)
                        What's the matter?

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, these men who are 
                        now with the "Enquirer" - who were 
                        with the "Chronicle" until yesterday -
                        weren't they just as devoted to 
                        the "Chronicle" kind of paper as 
                        they are now to - our kind of paper?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sure.  They're like anybody else.
                        They got work to do.  They do it.
                               (proudly)
                        Only they happen to be the best 
                        men in the business.

                                    KANE
                               (finishing his speech)
                        There are other subjects in the 
                        world -

          Kane whistles.  The band and the chorus girls enter and hell 
          breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein.

                                    LELAND
                               (after a minute)
                        Do we stand for the same things 
                        that the "Chronicle" stands for, 
                        Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (indignantly)
                        Certainly not.  So what's that got 
                        to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll 
                        have them changed to his kind of 
                        newspapermen in a week.

                                    LELAND
                        Probably.  There's always a chance, 
                        of course, that they'll change Mr.
                        Kane - without his knowing it.

          Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein.  He sits down next 
          to them, lighting a cigarette.

                                    KANE
                        Well, gentlemen, are we going to 
                        war?

                                    LELAND
                        Our readers are, anyway, I don't 
                        know about the rest of the country.

                                    KANE
                               (enthusiastically)
                        It'll be our first foreign war in 
                        fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it 
                        the way the "Hickville Gazette" 
                        covers the church social!  The 
                        names of everybody there; what 
                        they wore; what they ate; who won 
                        the prizes; who gave the prizes -
                               (gets excited)
                        I tell you, Brad, I envy you.
                               (quoting)
                        By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's"
                        Special Correspondent at the Front.
                        I'm almost tempted -

                                    LELAND
                        But there is no Front, Charlie.
                        There's a very doubtful civil war.
                        Besides, I don't want the job.

                                    KANE
                        All right, Brad, all right - you 
                        don't have to be a war correspondent 
                        unless you want to - I'd want to.
                               (looking up)
                        Hello, Georgie.

          Georgie, a very handsome madam has walked into the picture, 
          stands behind him.  She leans over and speaks quietly in his 
          ear.

                                    GEORGIE
                        Is everything the way you want it, 
                        dear?

                               (looking around)
                        If everybody's having fun, that's 
                        the way I want it.

                        I've got some other little girls
                        coming over -

                                    LELAND
                               (interrupting)
                        Charles, I tell you there is no 
                        war!  There's a condition that 
                        should be remedied - but between 
                        that and a -

                                    KANE
                               (seriously)
                        How would the "Enquirer" look with 
                        no news about this non-existent 
                        war - with Benton, Pulitzer and 
                        Heart devoting twenty columns a 
                        day to it?

                                    LELAND
                        They do it only because you do!

                                    KANE
                               (grins)
                        And I do it because they do it, 
                        and they do it - it's a vicious 
                        circle, isn't it?
                               (rises)
                        I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad -
                        you know, Georgie, don't you?

          Leland nods.

                                    GEORGIE
                               (over Kane's next 
                               lines)
                        Glad to meet you, Brad.

          Leland shudders.

                                    KANE
                        I told you about Brad, Georgie.
                        He needs to relax.

          Brad doesn't answer.

          INT. GEORGIE'S PLACE - NIGHT -

          Georgie is introducing a young lady to Branford Leland.  On 
          sound track we hear piano music.

                                    GEORGIE
                               (right on cue from 
                               preceding scene)
                        Ethel - this gentlemen has been 
                        very anxious to meet you -  This 
                        is Ethel.

                                    ETHEL
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

          Camera pans to include Kane, seated at piano, with girls 
          gathered around him.

                                    ONE OF THE GIRLS
                        Charlie!  Play the song about you.

                                    ANOTHER GIRL
                        Is there a song about Charlie?

          Kane has broken into "Oh, Mr. Kane!" and Charlie and the girls 
          start to sing.  Ethel leads the unhappy Leland over to the 
          group.  Kane, seeing Leland and taking his eye, motions to the 
          professor who has been standing next to him to take over.  The 
          professor does so.  The singing continues.  Kane rises and 
          crosses to Leland.

                                    KANE
                        Say, Brad.
                               (draws him slightly 
                               aside)
                        I've got an idea.

                                    LELAND
                        Yes?

                                    KANE
                        I mean I've got a job for you.

                                    LELAND
                        Good.

                                    KANE
                        You don't want to be a war 
                        correspondent - how about being a 
                        dramatic critic?

                                    LELAND
                               (sincerely, but not 
                               gushing; seriously)
                        I'd like that.

          Kane starts quietly to dance in time to the music.  Leland 
          smiles at him.

                                    KANE
                        You start tomorrow night.  Richard

                               (or supply show)
                        I'll get us some girls.  You get 
                        tickets.  A drama critic gets them 
                        free, you know.

                        Yes?

                                    LELAND
                               (still smiling)
                        It doesn't make any difference 
                        about me, but one of these days 
                        you're going to find out that all 
                        this charm of yours won't be enough -

                                    KANE
                               (has stopped dancing)
                        You're wrong.  It does make a 
                        difference to you -  Rector's, 
                        Brad?
                               (starts to dance 
                               again)
                        Come to think of it, I don't blame 
                        you for not wanting to be a war 
                        correspondent.  You won't miss 
                        anything.  It isn't much of a war.
                        Besides, they tell me there isn't 
                        a decent restaurant on the whole 
                        island.

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. RECTOR'S - NIGHT -

          Leland, Kane, two young ladies at Rector's.  Popular music is 
          heard over the soundtrack.  Everybody is laughing very, very 
          hard at something Kane has said.  The girls are hysterical.  
          Kane can hardly breathe.  As Leland's laughter becomes more 
          and more hearty, it only increases the laughter of the others.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. CUNARD LOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -

          As told by Bernstein.  Kane is calling down to Leland and 
          Bernstein (as before).

                                    KANE
                        You don't expect me to keep any of 
                        those promises, do you?

          A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne" and further ship-to-
          shore conversation is rendered unfeasible.

          Bernstein and Leland on deck.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (turns to Leland)
                        Do you, Mr. Leland?

                                    LELAND
                               (smiling)
                        Certainly not.

          Slight pause.  They continue on their way.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to 
                        Europe with him?  He wanted you
                        to.  He said to me just yesterday -

                                    LELAND
                        I wanted him to have fun - and 
                        with me along -

          This stops Bernstein.  Bernstein looks at him.

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me
                        ask you a few questions, and answer 
                        me truthfully.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Don't I always?  Most of the time?

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?  
                        Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am 
                        I a New England school-marm?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Yes.

          Leland is surprised.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        If you thought I'd answer different 
                        from what Mr. Kane tells you - 
                        well, I wouldn't.

                                    LELAND
                               (good naturedly)
                        You're in a conspiracy against me, 
                        you two.  You always have been.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Against me there should be such a 
                        conspiracy some time!

          He pauses.  "Auld Lang Syne" can still be heard from the deck 
          of the department steamer.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (with a hopeful 
                               look in his eyes)
                        Well, he'll be coming back in 
                        September.  The Majestic.  I got 
                        the reservations.  It gets in on 
                        the ninth.

                                    LELAND
                        September the ninth?

          Leland puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out a pencil and 
          small engagement book, opens the book and starts to write.

          Leland's pencil writing on a page in the engagement book open 
          to September 9: "Rector's - 8:30 p.m."

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy.

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Leland and Thompson.  Leland is speaking as we dissolve.

                                    LELAND
                        I used to go to dancing school 
                        with her.

          Thompson had handed Leland a paper.

                                    LELAND
                        What's this?

                                    THOMPSON
                        It's a letter from her lawyers.

                                    LELAND
                               (reading aloud from 
                               the letter)
                        David, Grobleski & Davis -  My
                        dear Rawlston -
                               (looks up)

                                    THOMPSON
                        Rawlston is my boss.

                                    LELAND
                        Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.

                                    THOMPSON
                        He knows the first Mrs. Kane 
                        socially -  That's the answer we 
                        got.

                                    LELAND
                               (reading)
                        I am in receipt of your favor of 
                        yesterday.  I beg you to do me the 
                        courtesy of accepting my assurance 
                        that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be 
                        induced to contribute any more 
                        information on the career of Charles 
                        Foster Kane.

          She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she 
          regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her 
          life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest 
          esteem - Leland hands the paper back to Thompson.

                                    LELAND
                        Brief marriage!  Ten years!
                               (sighs)

                                    THOMPSON
                        Was he in love?

                                    LELAND
                        He married for love -
                               (a little laugh)
                        That's why he did everything.  
                        That's why he went into politics.  
                        It seems we weren't enough.  He 
                        wanted all the voters to love him, 
                        too.  All he really wanted out of 
                        life was love.  That's Charlie's 
                        story - it's the story of how he 
                        lost it.  You see, he just didn't 
                        have any to give.  He loved Charlie 
                        Kane, of course, very dearly - and 
                        his mother, I guess he always loved 
                        her.  As for Emily - well, all I 
                        can tell you is Emily's story as 
                        she told it to me, which probably 
                        isn't fair - there's supposed to 
                        be two sides to every story - and 
                        I guess there are.  I guess there's
                        more than two sides -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY -

          This scene is shot so as never to show the President - or at 
          least never his face.  There is present the President's 
          Secretary, sitting on one side of the desk, intently taking 
          notes.  Kane is on his feet, in front of the desk, tense and 
          glaring.

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        It is the unanimous opinion of my 
                        Cabinent - in which I concur - 
                        that the proposed leases are in 
                        the best interests of the 
                        Governement and the people.
                               (pauses)
                        You are not, I hope, suggesting 
                        that these interests are not 
                        indentical?

                                    KANE
                        I'm not suggesting anything, Mr.
                        President!  I've come here to tell 
                        you that, unless some action is 
                        taken promptly - and you are the 
                        only one who can take it - the oil 
                        that is the property of the people 
                        of this country will be turned 
                        over for a song to a gang of high-
                        pressure crooks!

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                               (calmly)
                        I must refuse to allow you to 
                        continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                               (screaming)
                        It's the only vein I know.  I tell 
                        the facts the way I see them.  And
                        any man that knows that facts -

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I 
                        happen to have the incredible 
                        insolence to differ with you as to 
                        what they mean.
                               (pause)
                        You're a man of great talents, Mr. 
                        Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        I understand that you have political 
                        ambitions.  Unfortunately, you 
                        seem incapable of allowing any 
                        other opinion but your own -

                                    KANE
                               (building to a frenzy)
                        I'm much obliged, Mr. President, 
                        for your concern about me.  However, 
                        I happen to be concerned at this 
                        moment with the matter of extensive 
                        oil lands belonging to the people 
                        of the United States, and I say 
                        that if this lease goes through, 
                        the property of the people of the 
                        United States goes into the hands 
                        of -

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                               (interrupting)
                        You've made your point perfectly 
                        clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.

          The Secretary rises.  Kane, with every bit of will power 
          remotely at his disposal to control what might become an 
          hysterical outburst, manages to bow.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. President.

          He starts out of the office.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. COMPOSING ROOM - ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Kane, Reilly, Leland and a composing room Foreman, in working 
          clothes, bending over a table with several forms of type.  
          They are looking, at this moment, at a made-up headline - but 
          Kane's back is in the way ... so we can't read it.

                                    FOREMAN
                        How about it, Mr. Kane?

          Reilly glances at his wrist watch and makes a face.  Kane smiles 
          as he notices this.

                                    KANE
                        All right.  Let her slide!

          He turns away, and we can now read the headline.

          Insert of the headline, which reads: "OIL THEFT BECOMES LAW AS 
          PRESIDENT WITHOLDS VETO"

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Here follows a quick montage (presently to be worked out) of 
          no more than four or five images in which the President, by 
          means of cartoons, editorials, headlines (all faithfully 
          reproduced from period yellow journalism) is violently attacked.  
          The montage ends on the word TREASON.  The music cuts.

          A hand reaches in a side pocket which contains a newspaper - 
          recognizably the "Enquirer."  The hand removes a gun.  The gun 
          is shot.  Many arms seize the hand which is pulled up - gun 
          still firing.  As the arm is raised in the air, we see that 
          the other arms holding the arm and struggling with it are 
          uniformed, and we see the White House beyond.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          News ticker which is spelling out the words: "ASSASSINATED 
          7:45 P.M."

          NOTE:  Under the following - a down shot, below the "Enquirer," 
          shows a crowd forming, looking angrily up toward the camera.  
          Crowd noises on the soundtrack under music.

          A hand snatches the ticker tape away and as the image of the 
          crowd dissolves out, we pull back to show:

          INT. OF KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT -

          The ticker tape is in Reilly's hand.  Reilly has a phone to 
          his ear.

                                    REILLY
                        Looks bad for us, Mr. Kane.  How 
                        shall we handle it?

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

                        It's a news story!  Get it on the 
                        street!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Headline under "Enquirer" masthead which reads: 

          "PRESIDENT ASSASSINATED"

          Newsboy is crying the headline at the same time.  We pull back 
          to show him and -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

          The camera is in tight on a box which contains Emily and 
          distinguished elderly ladies and gentlemen, obviously family 
          and friends.  On the soundtrack, very limpid opera music.  
          Another elderly gent, in white tie but still wearing an 
          overcoat, comes into the box and whispers to Emily.  He has a 
          copy of the "Enquirer" in his hand.  Emily rises.  He shows 
          the paper to her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT -

          An angry crowd seen from the window of Kane's office.  They 
          make a deep threatening sound which is audible during the 
          following scene.  Across the heads of the crowd are two great 
          squares of light from the windows above them.  One of these 
          disappears as the blind is pulled.  As the dissolve completes 
          itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, 
          and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland 
          pulls down, covering the entire frame.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          The staff standing around, worried to death, in their 
          shirtsleeves.

                        was the President of the United

                        Yes?

                                    LELAND
                        Do you think you're the one who 
                        should call him a great man?

                                    KANE
                        Why not?

                                    LELAND
                        Why not?  Well - nobody's a great 
                        man in your estimation until he's 
                        dead.

                        Maybe we'd better wait for more 
                        word on the President's condition.

                               Leland)
                        What do you mean by that?

                               (quietly)
                        Competition.

                                    REILLY
                        He may recover -

                               Leland)
                        What do you mean by that?

                               (steadily)
                        Yesterday morning you called the 
                        President a traitor.  What do you 
                        think that crowd is doing down 
                        there?  They think you murdered 
                        him.

                                    KANE
                        Because the crackpot who did it 
                        had a copy of the "Enquirer" in 
                        his pocket?

                                    LELAND
                        - and that copy of the "Enquirer" 
                        said the President should be killed.

                                    KANE
                        I said treason was a capital offense
                        punishable by death -

                                    LELAND
                        You've said a lot of things about 
                        the President in the last few 
                        months.

                                    KANE
                        They're true!  Everything I said!
                        Witholding that veto was treason!

                                    LELAND
                               (interrupting)
                        Charlie!

                                    KANE
                               (riding over him)
                        Oil belonging to the people of the 
                        United States was leased out for a 
                        song to a gang of high-pressure
                        crooks -  Nobody can blame me 
                        because -

                                    LELAND
                        Look out that window.

          Kane stops - looks at him.

                                    LELAND
                        There are the people of the United
                        States, and they are blaming you -
                        Oh, I know it doesn't make any 
                        sense, but at least you can learn 
                        a lesson from it.

                                    KANE
                               (snarling)
                        What lesson?  Not to expose fraud 
                        when I see it?  Not to fight for 
                        the right of the people to own 
                        their own property?
                               (he turns to Reilly)
                        Run it the way I said, Reilly - 
                        "This afternoon a great man was 
                        assassinated -"

                                    LELAND
                        Charlie!  Now you're not making 
                        sense.

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        I don't have to.  I run a newspaper 
                        with half a million readers and 
                        they're getting a martyred president 
                        this morning with their breakfast.
                        I can't help that.  Besides, they 
                        all know I'm married to his niece.  
                        I've got to think of her.

                                    LELAND
                        What?

                                    KANE
                        I've got to think of Emily -

                                    LELAND
                               (after a silence)
                        I'd like to talk to you about that.

                                    KANE
                        Go ahead.

          Leland looks back at Kane, is conscious of the boys standing 
          around.

                                    LELAND
                        Finish your editorial.

          Leland walks out in to the City Room.  More staff members in 
          shirt sleeves in a state of panic.  Leland goes to his desk, 
          takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink.  A door 
          opens.  A Policeman enters with Bernstein.  Bernstein is badly 
          battered.  The boys crowd around.

                                    LELAND
                               (worried)
                        What's happened?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (smiling)
                        I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only 
                        there was some fellows out front 
                        that thought they ought to take 
                        things up with me.  I learned 'em!
                        Didn't I, officer?

                                    THE COP
                               (grinning)
                        You sure did -  Say, the 
                        Commissioner said I was to stand 
                        by and protect Mr. Kane until 
                        further orders, no matter how he 
                        felt about it.  Where is he?

                                    LELAND
                               (finishing his drink)
                        In there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        If you hadn't come along and 
                        protected me when you did, I'd 
                        have killed them fellows.

                                    LELAND
                               (pouring himself 
                               another drink)
                        Go and get yourself washed up, Mr.
                        Bernstein.
                               (he looks his face 
                               over thoroughly)
                        There doesn't seem to be an serious 
                        injury.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Not to me.  But you will let that 
                        cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't 
                        you?

                                    LELAND
                        Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

          Bernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance.  
          Leland finishes his second drink.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT -

          The bottle is finished.  The door in the Sanctrum opens.  Reilly 
          and the others leave.

                                    REILLY
                               (as they go)
                        Goodnight, Mr. Kane.

          Kane stands in the door, waiting for Leland.  Leland gets up 
          and moves toward the office - goes in, sits down across from 
          Kane at the desk.  An uncomfortable pause.  Then Kane smiles 
          ingratiatingly.  Leland tries to cope with this.

                                    LELAND
                        First of all -
                               (he can't go on)

                                    KANE
                               (not cruelly - 
                               genuinely kind)
                        What's wrong, Brad?

                                    LELAND
                        I'm drunk.

                                    KANE
                        I'll get you some coffee.

          He rises and goes to the door.

                                    LELAND
                        First of all, I will not write a 
                        good review of a play because 
                        somebody paid a thousand dollars 
                        for an advertisement in the 
                        "Enquirer."

                                    KANE
                               (gently - opening 
                               the door)
                        That's just a little promotion 
                        scheme.  Nobody expects you -
                               (calling)
                        Mike, will you try and get Mr. 
                        Leland some coffee?

                                    MIKE'S VOICE
                        Sure thing, Mr. Kane.

          Kane turns back to Leland.  Leland doesn't look up at him.

                                    LELAND
                        Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't 
                        agree anymore.  I wish you'd let 
                        me go to Chicago.

                                    KANE
                        Why, Brad?

                                    LELAND
                        I want to be transferred to the 
                        new paper.  You've been saying 
                        yourself you wish you had somebody 
                        to -
                               (he is heartsick, 
                               inarticulate)
                        That's not what I wanted to talk 
                        about.

          Kane goes around behind the desk and sits down.

                                    KANE
                        I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad -
                        I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll 
                        help.

                                    LELAND
                        No, that won't help.  Besides, you 
                        never get drunk.  I wanted to talk 
                        about you and Emily.

          Kane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        All right.

                                    LELAND
                               (without looking at 
                               him)
                        She's going to leave you -

                                    KANE
                        I don't think so, Brad.  We've 
                        just had word that the President 
                        is out of danger.
                               (ruefully)
                        It seems I didn't kill him after 
                        all.

                                    LELAND
                               (takes his eye)
                        She was going to leave you anyway -

          Kane takes this in.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily's going south next week with 
                        the child.  As far as anybody's to 
                        know, it's a holiday.  When they 
                        get back -

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        Brad, you are drunk.

                                    LELAND
                        Sure I am.  She wants full custody 
                        of the child no matter what happens.
                        If you won't agree to that, she'll 
                        apply for a divorce regardless of 
                        the President's wishes.  I can't 
                        tell her she's wrong, because she 
                        isn't wrong -

                                    KANE
                        Why is she leaving me?

                                    LELAND
                               (it's very hard for 
                               him to say all 
                               this)
                        She hasn't any friends left sine 
                        you started this oil business, and 
                        she never sees you.

                                    KANE
                        Do you think the "Enquirer" 
                        shouldn't have campaigned against 
                        the oil leases?

                                    LELAND
                               (hesitating)
                        You might have made the whole thing 
                        less personal!

          No answer from Kane.

                                    LELAND
                        It isn't just that the President 
                        was her uncle - everyone she knows, 
                        all the people she's been brought 
                        up with, everything she's ever 
                        been taught to believe is important -

          Still no answer from Kane.

                                    LELAND
                        There's no reason why this - this
                        savage personal note -

                                    KANE
                        The personal note is all there is 
                        to it.  It's all there ever is to 
                        it.  It's all there every is to 
                        anything!  Stupidity in our 
                        government, complacency and self-
                        satisfaction and unwillingness to 
                        believe that anything done by a 
                        certain class of people can be 
                        wrong - you can't fight those things 
                        impersonally.  They're not 
                        impersonal crimes against people.  
                        They're being done by actual persons - 
                        with actual names and positions 
                        and - the right of the American 
                        people to own their own country is 
                        not an academic issue, Brad, that 
                        you debate - and then the judges 
                        retire to return a verdict and the 
                        winners give a dinner for the 
                        losers.

                                    LELAND
                        You almost convince me.
                               (rising)
                        I'm just drunk enough to tell you 
                        the truth.  I have to be a little 
                        drunk for that because I'm a coward.  
                        You know that.  That's why you 
                        keep me around.
                               (smiles)
                        You only associate with your 
                        inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's 
                        why you ran away from Emily.  
                        Because you can't stand the company 
                        of your equals.  You don't like to 
                        admit they exist - the other big 
                        people in your world are dead.
                        I told you that.

          Kane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now.  He 
          speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal 
          indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a 
          disease.

                                    LELAND
                        You talk about the people of the 
                        United States as though they 
                        belonged to you.  When you find 
                        out they don't think they are, 
                        you'll lose interest.  You talk 
                        about giving them their rights as 
                        though you could make a present of 
                        liberty.  Remember the working 
                        man?  You used to defend him quite 
                        a good deal.  Well, he's turning 
                        into something called organized 
                        labor and you don't like that at 
                        all.  And listen, when your precious 
                        underprivileged really get together - 
                        that's going to add up to something

                        and then I don't know what you'll 
                        do - sail away to a desert island, 
                        probably, and lord it over the 
                        monkeys.

                        Yes.

                        Now, will you let me go to Chicago?

                        You're not going to like it in 
                        Chicago.  They wind comes howling 
                        in from the lake.  And there's
                        practically no opera season at all -
                        and the Lord only knows whether
                        they've ever heard of Lobster

                        What are you going to do about

                               a little)
                        Nothing - if she dosen't love me -

          Leland has risen.  He speaks as he turns away, starting towards 
          the door.

                        You want love on your own terms,

                               Kane)
                        Love according to your own rules.
                        And if anything goes wrong and 
                        you're hurt - then the game stops, 
                        and you've got to be soothed and 
                        nursed, no matter what else is 
                        happening - and no matter who else

                        It's simpler than that, Brad.  A 
                        society girl can't stand the gaff, 
                        that's all.  Other things are 
                        important to her - social position, 
                        what they're saying on the front 
                        porches at Southampton, is it going 
                        to be embarrassing to meet somebody
                        or the other at dinner -

          Leland has turned, taking his eye again.  Now Kane stops and 
          smiles.

                        She can leave me.  As a matter of 
                        fact, I've already left her.  Don't 
                        worry, Brad - I'll live.

                                    LELAND

                        another brandy.

          Leland shakes his head.  Kane lifts his glass.

                        To love on my terms.  Those are

          EXT. ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT -

          Kane, Leland, and a couple of policemen make their way out of 
          the front toward a hansom cab.

                                    A VOICE FROM THE CROWD
                        You moiderer!

          A rock is thrown.  It hits Leland on the face.  A little blood 
          flows.  Kane doesn't see it at first.  Then when he's in the 
          hansom cab, he turns and notices it.

                                    KANE
                        Are you hurt?

          Leland has a handkerchief to his face.

                                    LELAND
                        No.  I wish you'd go home to Emily.
                        She'll be pretty upset by all this -
                        She still loves you -

          The crowd, pushed by the cops, retreats in the background, but 
          still hard by.

                        low salary here in New York.  It 
                        seems to me that the new dramatic 
                        critic of our Chicago paper should 
                        get what he's worth.

                        let the salary stay where it is.

          The hansom cab starts up.  We hold on Leland's face as we

          INT. KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - KANE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING -

          Emily is in bed, a damp cloth over her temples.  Kane is 
          standing at the foot of the bed.  The baby's bed is in a corner 
          of the room.  The baby's nurse is standing near the crib, a 
          nurse for Emily is near her.  Kane is looking fixedly on Emily, 
          who is staring tiredly at the ceiling.

                                    KANE
                               (to the nurse)
                        Excuse us a moment, please.

          The nurse looks at Emily.

                                    KANE
                               (peremptorily)
                        I said, excuse us a moment.

          The nurse, unwilling, leaves.

                                    KANE
                        I've been talking to Leland.  Emily -
                        You can't leave me now - not now -

          Silence.

                                    KANE
                        It isn't what it would do to my 
                        changes in politics, Emily -  That 
                        isn't it -  They were talking of 
                        running me for governor, but now,
                        of course, we'll have to wait -
                        It isn't that, Emily -  It's just -
                        the president is your uncle and 
                        they're saying I killed him.

          Still silence.

                        That story about the murderer having

                        pocket - the "Chronicle" made that 
                        up out of whole cloth -  Emily, 
                        please - He's going to be all right, 
                        you know, he's going to recover -

                        morning.  Bernstein is afraid to 
                        open any more letters.  He -

          He stops.  He sees that he's getting no place with Emily.

          He waits for her to continue.

                                    EMILY
                        Do you really think -
                               (she can't continue)
                        Those threatening letters, can
                        they really -

          She sits up and looks at the crib.  She almost continues to 
          look at the crib, with almost unseeing eyes.

                        Please don't talk any more, Charles.

          Kane is about to say something, but bites his lips instead.  
          Emily keeps staring at him.

                                    EMILY
                        Have they heard from father yet?
                        Has he seen -

                                    KANE
                        I've tried to tell you, Emily.
                        The President's going to be all 
                        right.  He had a comfortable night.
                        There's no danger of any kind.

          Emily nods several times.  There is an uncomforable silence.  
          Suddenly there is a cry from the crib.  Emily leaps from the 
          bed and rushes to him.  She bends over the crib.

                                    EMILY
                               (murmuring)
                        Here I am, darling...  Darling!...  
                        Darling, it's all right...  Mother's 
                        here.

                        Emily - you musn't leave me now -
                        you can't do that to me.

                                    EMILY
                        They won't hurt you, darling.
                        Mother's with you!  Mother's looking 
                        after you!

          Kane, unwanted, ignored, looks on.  Tightening his lips, he 
          walks out.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          By the desk light, Kane is seen working with his usual 
          intensity,  Reilly standing beside him at the desk.

                                    KANE
                        We'll withdraw support completely.
                        Anything else?

                                    REILLY
                        Mr. Leland sent back that check.

                                    KANE
                        What check?

                                    REILLY
                        You made it out to him last week 
                        after he left for Chicago.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, yes, the bonus.

                                    REILLY
                        It was for twenty-five thousand 
                        dollars.

          Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his 
          mind will be on something else.

                                    REILLY
                        He sent it back torn up - all torn 
                        up into little bits, and he enclosed 
                        something else -  I can't make it 
                        out.

          Kane doesn't answer.  Reilly goes on.  He has brought out a 
          piece of paper and is reading it.

                                    REILLY
                        It says here, "A Declaration of
                        Principles" -
                               (he still reads)
                        "I will provide the people of this 
                        city with a daily paper that will
                        tell all the news honestly" -

          Kane has looked up sharply.  Reilly, sensing his look, stops 
          reading and meets his eye.  Slowly, Kane reaches out his hand.  
          Reilly hands him the piece of paper.  Without reading it, Kane 
          tears it up, throws it into the wastebasket at his side.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          The evening of the final great rally.  These shots remind us 
          of and are identical with and supplementary to the "News Digest" 
          scenes earlier.  The vast auditorium with a huge picture of 
          Kane, cheering crowds, etc.  Emily and Junior are to be seen 
          in the front of a box.  Emily is tired and wears a forced smile 
          on her face.  Junior, now aged nine and a half, is eager, bright-
          eyed and excited.  Kane is just finishing his speech.

                                    KANE
                        It is no secret that I entered 
                        upon this campaign with no thought 
                        that I could be elected Governor 
                        of this state!  It is now no secret 
                        that every straw vote, every 
                        independent pole, shows that I 
                        will be elected.  And I repeat to 
                        you - my first official act as 
                        Governor will be to appoint a 
                        special District Attorney to arrange 
                        for the indictment, prosecution 
                        and conviction of Boss Edward G. 
                        Rogers!

          Terrific screaming and cheering from the audience.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          The Speaker's Platform.  Numerous officials and civic leaders 
          are crowding around Kane.  Cameramen take flash photographs 
          with old-fashioined flash powder.

                                    FIRST CIVIC LEADER
                        Great speech, Mr. Kane.

                                    SECOND LEADER
                               (pompous)
                        One of the most notable public 
                        utterances ever made by a candidate
                        in this state -

                                    KANE
                        Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.

          He looks up and notices that the box in which Emily and the 
          boy were sitting is now empty.  He starts toward the rear of 
          the platform, through the press of people, Reilly approaches 
          him.

                                    REILLY
                        A wonderful speech, Mr. Kane.

          Kane pats him on the shoulder as he walks along.

                                    REILLY
                        I just got word from Buffalo, Mr.
                        Kane.  They're going to throw you 
                        the organization vote - and take a 
                        chance maybe you'll give them a
                        break -

          This is said almost inquiringly, as if he were hoping that 
          Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not making 
          a mistake.  There is no answer from Kane.

                                    REILLY
                        On an independent ticket there's 
                        never been anything like it!  If 
                        the election were held today, you'd 
                        be elected by a hundred thousand 
                        votes - and every day between now 
                        and November 7th is just going to 
                        add to your majority.

          Kane is very pleased.  He continues with Reilly slowly through 
          the crowd - a band playing off.  Bernstein joins him.

                                    KANE
                        It does seem too good to be true, 
                        doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    REILLY
                        Rogers isn't even pretending.  He 
                        isn't just scared anymore.  He's 
                        sick.  Frank Norris told me last 
                        night he hasn't known Rogers to be 
                        that worried in twenty-five years.

                                    KANE
                        I think it's beginning to dawn on 
                        Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say.
                        With Mr. Rogers out of the way, 
                        Reilly, I think we may really begin 
                        to hope for a good government in 
                        this state.
                               (stopping)
                        Well, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (clearly not meaning 
                               it)
                        It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  
                        Wonderful.  Wonderful.

                                    KANE
                        You don't really think so?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're 
                        running for Governor - and you 
                        want to be elected -  I think it's 
                        wonderful you're going to be 
                        elected.  Only -
                               (interrupts himself)
                        -  Can I say something?

                                    KANE
                        Please, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, the way I look at it -
                               (comes out with it)
                        -  You want to know what I really 
                        think would be wonderful?

          Kane indicates he is to proceed.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, you're running for Governor 
                        and going to be elected - my idea 
                        is how wonderful it would be if 
                        you don't run at all and don't get 
                        elected.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ONE OF THE EXITS - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          Emily and Junior are standing, waiting for Kane.

                                    JUNIOR
                        Is Pop Governor yet, Mom?

          Just then, Kane appears, with Reilly and several other men.  
          Kane rushes toward Emily and Junior, as the men politely greet 
          Emily.

                                    KANE
                        Hello, Butch!  Did you like your 
                        old man's speech?

                                    JUNIOR
                        Hello, Pop!  I was in a box.  I 
                        could hear every word.

                                    KANE
                        I saw you!
                               (he has his arm 
                               around Junior's 
                               shoulder)
                        Good night, gentlemen.

          There are good nights.  Kane's car is at the curb and he starts 
          to walk toward it with Junior and Emily.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm sending Junior home in the
                        car, Charles - with Oliver -

                                    KANE
                        But I'd arranged to go home with 
                        you myself.

                                    EMILY
                        There's a call I want you to make 
                        with me, Charles.

                                    KANE
                        It can wait.

                                    EMILY
                        No, it can't.
                               (she bends down and 
                               kisses Junior)
                        Good night, darling.

                                    JUNIOR
                        Good night, Mom.

          The driver is holding the rear door open as Emily guides Junior 
          in.

                                    KANE
                               (as car starts to 
                               drive off)
                        What's this all about, Emily?  
                        I've had a very tiring day and -

                                    EMILY
                        It may not be about anything at 
                        all.

          A cab has pulled up.

                                    THE DRIVER
                        Cab?

          Emily nods to him.

                                    EMILY
                        I intend to find out.

                                    KANE
                        I insist on being told exactly 
                        what you have in mind.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm going to -
                               (she looks at a 
                               slip of paper in 
                               her hand)
                        - 185 West 74th Street.

          Kane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means 
          something to him.

                                    EMILY
                        If you wish, you can come with 
                        me...

          Kane nods.

                                    KANE
                        I'll go with you.

          He opens the door and she enters the cab.  He follows her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CAB - NIGHT -

          Kane and Emily.  He looks at her, in search of some kind of 
          enlightenment.  Her face is set and impassive.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. AND INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT -

          Kane and Emily, in front of an apartment door.  Emily is 
          pressing the bell.

                                    KANE
                        I had no idea you had this flair 
                        for melodrama, Emiliy.

          Emily does not answer.  The door is opened by a maid, who 
          recognizes Kane.

                                    THE MAID
                        Come in, Mr. Kane, come in.

          They enter, Emily first.

          INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT -

          There is first a tiny reception room, through which an open 
          door shows the living room.  Kane and Emily enter from the 
          hallway and cross to the living room.  As they enter, Susan 
          rises from a chair.  The other person  in the room - a big, 
          heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, 
          leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently.

                                    SUSAN
                        It wasn't my fault, Charlie.  He 
                        made me send your wife a note.
                        He said I'd - oh, he's been saying 
                        the most terrible things, I didn't
                        know what to do...  I -
                               (she catches sight 
                               of Emily)

                                    ROGERS
                        Good evening, Mr. Kane.
                               (he rises)
                        I don't suppose anybody would 
                        introduce us.  Mrs. Kane, I am 
                        Edward Rogers.

                                    EMILY
                        How do you do?
                               (pauses)
                        I came here - and I made Mr. Kane 
                        come with me...
                               (she consults the 
                               note in her hand 
                               without reading it 
                               again)
                        because I recieved this note -

                                    ROGERS
                        I made Miss - Miss Alexander send 
                        you the note.  She was a little
                        unwilling at first -
                               (he smiles grimly)
                        but she did it.

                                    SUSAN
                        I can't tell you the things he 
                        said, Charlie.  You haven't got
                        any idea -

                                    KANE
                               (turning on Rogers)
                        Rogers, I don't think I will 
                        postpone doing something about you 
                        until I'm elected.
                               (he starts toward 
                               him)
                        To start with, I'll break your 
                        neck.

                                    ROGERS
                               (not giving way an 
                               inch)
                        Maybe you can do it and maybe you 
                        can't, Mr. Kane.

                                    EMILY
                        Charles!
                               (he stops to look 
                               at her)
                        Your - your breaking this man's
                        neck -
                               (she is clearly 
                               disgusted)
                        would scarcely explain this note -
                               (glancing at the 
                               note)
                        Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -
                               (slowly)
                        for myself, and for my son.  What
                        does this note mean, Miss -

                                    SUSAN
                               (stiffly)
                        I'm Susan Alexander.
                               (pauses)
                        I know what you think, Mrs. Kane,
                        but -

                                    EMILY
                               (ignoring this)
                        What does this note mean, Miss 
                        Alexander?

                                    ROGERS
                        She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She 
                        just sent it - because I made her 
                        see it wouldn't be smart for her 
                        not to send it.

                                    KANE
                        In case you don't know, Emily,
                        this - this gentleman -
                               (he puts a world of 
                               scorn into the 
                               word)
                        is -

                                    ROGERS
                        I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, 
                        and your husband is just trying to 
                        be funny calling me one.  I don't 
                        even know what a gentleman is.
                               (tensely, with all 
                               the hatred and 
                               venom in the world)
                        You see, my idea of a gentleman, 
                        Mrs.  Kane - well, if I owned a 
                        newspaper and if I didn't like the 
                        way somebody else was doing things - 
                        some politican, say - I'd fight 
                        them with everything I had.  Only 
                        I wouldn't show him in a convict 
                        suit, with stripes - so his children 
                        could see the picture in the paper.  
                        Or his mother.
                               (he has to control 
                               himself from hurling 
                               himself at Kane)
                        It's pretty clear - I'm not a 
                        gentleman.

                                    EMILY
                        Oh!!

                                    KANE
                        You're a cheap, crooked grafter -
                        and your concern for your children
                        and your mother -

                                    ROGERS
                        Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only 
                        we're talking now about what you 
                        are.  That's what the note is about, 
                        Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay 
                        all my cards on the table.  I'm 
                        fighting for my life.  Not just my 
                        political life.  My life.  If your
                        husband is elected governor -

                                    KANE
                        I'm going to be elected governor.
                        And the first thing I'm going to
                        do -

                                    EMILY
                        Let him finish, Charles.

                                    ROGERS
                        I'm protecting myself every way I 
                        know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last 
                        week, I finally found out how I 
                        can stop your husband from being 
                        elected.  If the people of this 
                        state learn what I found out this 
                        week, he wouldn't have a chance to - 
                        he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  
                        Well, what I'm interested in is 
                        seeing that he's not elected.  I 
                        don't care whether they know what 
                        I know about him.  Let him keep 
                        right on being the Great, Noble, 
                        Moral -
                               (he stresses the 
                               world)
                        Champeen of the people.  Just as 
                        long as -

                                    EMILY
                        I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, 
                        but wonder if -
                               (she leaves her 
                               sentence unfinished)

                                    KANE
                        You can't blackmail me, Rogers, 
                        you can't -

                                    SUSAN
                               (excitedly)
                        Charlie, he said, unless you 
                        withdrew your name -

                                    ROGERS
                        That's the chance I'm willing to 
                        give you, Mr. Kane.  More of a 
                        chance than you'd give me.  Unless 
                        you make up your mind by tomorrow 
                        that you're so sick that you've 
                        got to go away for a year or two -
                        Monday morning every paper in this 
                        State will carry the story I'm 
                        going to give them.

          Kane starts to stare at him intently.

                                    EMILY
                        What story, Mr. Rogers?

                                    ROGERS
                        The story about him and Miss 
                        Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

          Emily looks at Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        There is no story.  It's all lies.
                        Mr. Kane is just -

                                    ROGERS
                               (to Susan)
                        Shut up!
                               (to Kane)
                        I've had a dozen men doing nothing 
                        but run this thing down - we've 
                        got evidence enough to - well, the 
                        evidence would stand up in any 
                        court of law.  You want me to give 
                        you the evidence, Mr. Kane?

                                    KANE
                        You do anything you want to do.
                        The people of this state can decide 
                        which one of us to trust.  If you 
                        want to know, they've already 
                        decided.  The election Tuesday'll 
                        be only -

                                    ROGERS
                        Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to
                        believe me.  I'd like to show you -

                                    EMILY
                        You don't have to show me anything, 
                        Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.

                                    ROGERS
                        I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without 
                        having to get the story published.
                        Not that I care about him.  But 
                        I'd be better off that way -
                               (he pauses)
                        - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        What about me?
                               (to Kane)
                        He said my name'd be dragged through 
                        the mud.  He said everywhere I'd 
                        go from now on -

                                    EMILY
                        There seems to be only one decision 
                        you can make, Charles.  I'd say 
                        that it has been made for you.
                               (pauses)
                        I suppose the details can be 
                        arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers.  
                        About the statements by the doctors -

                                    KANE
                        Have you gone completely mad, Emily?

          Emily looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        You don't think I'm going to let 
                        this blackmailer intimidate me, do 
                        you?

                                    EMILY
                        I don't see what else you can do, 
                        Charles.  If he's right - and the
                        papers publish this story he has -

                                    KANE
                        Oh, they'll publish it all right.
                        But that's not going to stop me -

                                    EMILY
                        Charles, this - this story - doesn't 
                        concern only you.  I'll be in it, 
                        too, won't I?
                               (quickly)
                        And Junior?

                                    KANE
                               (squirming a bit)
                        I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid 
                        of the story.  You can't tell me
                        that the voters of this state -

                                    EMILY
                        I'm not interested in the voters 
                        of this state right now.  I am 
                        interested in - well, Junior, for 
                        one thing.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie!  If they publish this
                        story -

                                    EMILY
                        They won't.  Goodnight, Mr. Rogers.
                               (she starts out)
                        There's nothing more to be said, 
                        Charles.

                                    KANE
                        Oh yes, there is.

                                    EMILY
                        I don't think so.  Are you coming, 
                        Charles?

                                    KANE
                        No.

          She looks at him.  He starts to work himself into a rage.

                                    KANE
                        There's only one person in the 
                        world to decide what I'm going to 
                        do - and that's me.  And if
                        you think - if any of you think -

                                    EMILY
                        You decided what you were going to 
                        do, Charles - some time ago.
                               (she looks at Susan)
                        You can't always have it your own 
                        way, regardless of anything else 
                        that may have happened.
                               (she sighs)
                        Come on, Charles.

                                    KANE
                        Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this 
                        thing all alone!

                                    ROGERS
                        You're making a bigger fool of 
                        yourself than I thought you would, 
                        Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why 
                        don't you -

                                    KANE
                               (turning on him)
                        Get out!  I've got nothing to talk 
                        to you about.  If you want to see 
                        me, have the Warden write me a 
                        letter.

                                    ROGERS
                        I see!
                               (he starts toward 
                               the door)

                                    SUSAN
                               (starting to cry)
                        Charlie, you're just excited.  You
                        don't realize -

                                    KANE
                        I know exactly what I'm doing.
                               (he is screaming)
                        Get out!

                                    EMILY
                               (quietly)
                        Charles, if you don't listen to
                        reason, it may be too late -

                                    KANE
                        Too late for what?  Too late for
                        you and this -
                               (he can't find the 
                               adjective)
                        this public thief to take the love 
                        of the people of this state away 
                        from me?  Well, you won't do it, I 
                        tell you.  You won't do it!

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie, there are other things to 
                        think of.
                               (a sly look comes 
                               into her eyes)
                        Your son - you don't want him to
                        read in the papers -

                                    EMILY
                        It is too late now, Charles.

                                    KANE
                               (rushes to the door 
                               and opens it)
                        Get out, both of you!

                                    SUSAN
                               (rushes to him)
                        Charlie, please don't -

                                    KANE
                        What are you waiting here for?
                        Why don't you go?

                                    EMILY
                        Goodnight, Charles.

          She walks out.  Rogers stops as he gets directly in front of 
          Kane.

                                    ROGERS
                        You're the greatest fool I've ever 
                        known, Kane.  If it was anybody 
                        else, I'd say what's going to happen 
                        to you would be a lesson to you.  
                        Only you're going to need more 
                        than one lesson.  And you're going 
                        to get more than one lesson.
                               (he walks past Kane)

                                    KANE
                        Don't you worry about me.  I'm 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, 
                        crooked politician, trying to save 
                        himself from the consequences of
                        his crimes -

          INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT -

          Camera angling toward Kane from other end of the hall.  Rogers 
          and Emily are already down the hall, moving toward foreground.  
          Kane in apartment doorway background.

                                    KANE
                               (screams louder)
                        I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, 
                        Rogers.  Sing Sing!

          Kane is trembling with rage as he shakes his fist at Rogers's 
          back.  Susan, quieter now, has snuggled into the hollow of his 
          shoulder as they stand in the doorway.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -

          Emily is opening the door for Leland.

                                    EMILY
                        Hello, Brad -

                                    LELAND
                        Emily -

          He pauses.  Leland comes in.  Emily closes the door.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad -
                        didn't -

                                    LELAND
                        Chicago is pretty close to New
                        York nowadays - only twenty hours -

          She doesn't have anything to say.

                                    LELAND
                        I'm glad to see you.

          She smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in 
          the world for her to smile at.  She's too grateful to talk.

                                    EMILY
                        Are all the returns in?

          Leland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper.

                                    EMILY
                        Let me see it.

          Leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to 
          her.  She takes it.  We see the headline, not an insert, but 
          it registers.  It reads: "Fraud at Polls."  Emily is looking 
          at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile.

                                    LELAND
                               (after a pause)
                        Almost two to one -

                                    EMILY
                        I'm surprised he got the votes he 
                        did.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily!

                                    EMILY
                        Why should anyone vote for him?  
                        He's made it quite clear to the 
                        people what he thinks of them.
                        Children - to be told one thing 
                        one day, something else the next, 
                        as the whim seizes him.  And they're 
                        supposed to be grateful and love 
                        and adore him - because he sees to 
                        it that they get cheap ice and 
                        only pay a nickel in the street 
                        cars.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily, you're being - a little 
                        unfair -  You know what I think of 
                        Charles' behavior - about your
                        personal lives -

                                    EMILY
                        There aren't any personal lives 
                        for people like us.  He made that
                        very clear to me nine years ago -
                        If I'd thought of my life with
                        Charles as a personal life, I'd
                        have left him then -

                                    LELAND
                        know that, Emily -

                                    EMILY
                               (on top of Leland)
                        Maybe I should have - the first 
                        time he showed me what a mad dog 
                        he really was.

                                    LELAND
                               (on the cue "dog")
                        Emily, you -

                                    EMILY
                        Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman
                        yet -

                                    LELAND
                        It's - all over -

          He stops himself.

                                    EMILY
                               (after a pause)
                        Know it is, Brad -

                                    LELAND
                        He's paying for it, Emily.  Those 
                        returns tonight - he's finished.
                        Politically -
                               (he thinks)
                        - socially, everywhere, I guess.
                        don't know about the papers, but -

                                    EMILY
                        If you're asking me to sympathize 
                        with him, Brad, you're wasting 
                        your time.
                               (pauses)
                        There's only one person I'm sorry
                        for, as a matter of fact.  That -
                        that shabby little girl.  I'm really 
                        sorry for her, Brad.

          Front page Chicago "Enquirer," with photograph proclaiming 
          that Susan Alexander opens at new Chicago Opera House in 
          "Thais," as in "News Digest."

          On soundtrack during above we hear the big, expectant murmur 
          of an opening night audience and the noodling of the orchestra.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - SET FOR "THAIS" -

          The camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage.  We 
          see the set for "Thais" - the principals in place - stage 
          managers, stage hands, etc., and in the center of all this, in 
          an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is 
          Susan.  She is almost hysterical with fright.  Maids, singing 
          teacher, and the rest are in attendance.  Her throat is sprayed.  
          Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the 
          orchestra starts thunderously.  The curtain starts to rise -
          the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up 
          Susan's body and hits her face.  She squints and starts to 
          sing.  Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, 
          up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into 
          the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging 
          canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly.  The camera 
          stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops.  Two 
          typical stage hands fill the frame.  They are looking down on 
          the stage below.  Some of the reflected light gleams on their 
          faces.  They look at each other.  One of them puts his hand to 
          his nose.

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Leland, as in the same scene in the Bernstein sequence, is 
          sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys.  The 
          paper is gone from the roller.  Leland stirs and looks up 
          drunkenly, his eyes encountering Bernstein, who stands beside 
          him (also as in the previous scene).

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        Hello, Bernstein.

          Leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together.  He 
          straightens and reaches for the keys - then sees the paper is 
          gone from the machine.

                                    LELAND
                        Where is it - where's my notice?
                        I've got to finish it!

                        Mr. Kane is finishing it.

                                    LELAND
                        Kane?  Charlie?
                               (painfully, he rises 
                               to his feet)
                        Where is he?

          During all this, the sound of a typewriter has been heard off - 
          a busy typewriter.  Leland's eyes follow the sound.  Slowly he 
          registers Kane in the City Room beyond.  This is almost the 
          same shot as in the previous Bernstein story.

          INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Kane, in white tie and shirt sleeves, is typing away at a 
          machine, his fingers working briskly and efficiently, his face, 
          seen by the desk light before him, set in a strange half-smile.

          Leland stands in the door of his office, staring across at 
          him.

                                    LELAND
                        I suppose he's fixing it up - I 
                        know I'd never get that through.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (moving to his side)
                        Mr. Kane is finishing your piece 
                        the way you started it.

          Leland turns incredulously to Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He's writing a roast like you wanted
                        it to be -
                               (then suddnely - 
                               with a kind of 
                               quiet passion rather 
                               than a triumph)
                        - I guess that'll show you.

          Leland picks his way across the City Room to Kane's side.  
          Kane goes on typing, without looking up.  After a pause, Kane 
          speaks.

                                    KANE
                        Hello, Brad.

                                    LELAND
                        Hello, Charlie -

                                    (ANOTHER PAUSE)
                        I didn't know we were speaking.

          Kane stops typing, but doesn't turn.

                                    KANE
                        Sure, we're speaking, Brad -
                        you're fired.

          He starts typing again, the expression on his face doesn't 
          change.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Thompson and Leland on the roof, which is now deserted.  It is 
          getting late.  The sun has just about gone down.

                                    LELAND
                        Well, that's about all there is -
                        and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!
                               (pause)
                        Five years ago, he wrote from that
                        place of his down South -
                               (as if trying to 
                               think)
                        - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?
                               (pauses)
                        Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of 
                        that place?  You know...  All right.  
                        Xanadu.  I knew what it was all 
                        the time.  You caught on, didn't 
                        you?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes.

                                    LELAND
                        I guess maybe I'm not as hard to 
                        see through as I think.  Anyway, I 
                        never even answered his letter.
                        Maybe I should have.  I guess he 
                        was pretty lonely down there those 
                        last years.  He hadn't finished it 
                        when she left him - he never 
                        finished it - he never finished 
                        anything.  Of course, he built it 
                        for her -

                                    THOMPSON
                        That must have been love.

                                    LELAND
                        I don't know.  He was disappointed 
                        in the world.  So he built one of 
                        his own -  An absolute monarchy -
                        It was something bigger than an 
                        opera house anyway -
                               (calls)
                        Nurse!
                               (lowers his voice)
                        Say, I'll tell you one thing you 
                        can do for me, young fellow.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sure.

                                    LELAND
                        On your way out, stop at a cigar 
                        store, will you, and send me up a 
                        couple of cigars?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad 
                        to.

                                    LELAND
                        Hey, Nurse!

          A Nurse appears.

                                    NURSE
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        I'm ready to go in now.  You know 
                        when I was a young man, there was 
                        an impression around that nurses 
                        were pretty.  It was no truer then
                        than it is now.

                                    NURSE
                        Here, let me take your arm, Mr. 
                        Leland.

                                    LELAND
                               (testily)
                        All right, all right.
                               (he has begun to 
                               move forward on 
                               the Nurse's arm; 
                               turning to Thompson)
                        You won't forget, will you, about 
                        the cigars?  And tell them to wrap 
                        them up to look like toothpaste, 
                        or something, or they'll stop them 
                        at the desk.  That young doctor I 
                        was telling you about, he's got an 
                        idea he wants to keep me alive.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          FLOOR SHOW

          SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE

          TWICE NIGHTLY

          glows on the dark screen as in the previous sequence earlier 
          in the script.  Behind the lights and through them, we see a 
          nasty early morning.  Camera as before, moves through the lights 
          of the sign and down on the skylight, through which is seen 
          Susan at her regular table,  Thompson seated across from her.

          Very faintly during this, idle piano music playing.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN -

          Susan and Thompson are facing each other.  The place is almost 
          deserted.  Susan is sober.  On the other side of the room, 
          somebody is playing a piano.

                                    SUSAN
                        How do you want to handle the whole 
                        thing - ask questions?

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'd rather you just talked.  
                        Anything that comes into your mind - 
                        about yourself and Mr. Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        You wouldn't want to hear a lot of 
                        what comes into my mind about myself 
                        and Mr. Charlie Kane.

          Susan is thinking.

                                    THOMPSON
                        How did you meet him?

                                    SUSAN
                        I had a toothache.

          Thompson looks at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        That was thiry years ago - and I 
                        still remember that toothache.
                        Boy!  That toothache was just 
                        driving me crazy...

          DISSOLVE IN:

          EXT. CORNER DRUG STORE AND STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEW YORK - 
          NIGHT -

          Susan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of 
          the period, is leaving the drug store.  It's about 8 o'clock 
          at night.  With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her 
          cheek, she is in considerable pain.  The street is wet - after 
          a recent rain.

          She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can 
          stand it no longer.  She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves 
          that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs 
          her gums.

          She walks on, the pain only a bit better.  Four or five houses 
          farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - 
          a shabby, old four-story apartment house.  She turns toward 
          the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps.

          As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost 
          bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her.  His shoulder 
          bumps hers and she turns.  As she does so, Kane, forced to 
          change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which 
          covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk.  The plank rises up and 
          cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud.

                                    KANE
                               (hopping up and 
                               down and rubbing 
                               his knee)
                        Ow!

          Susan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with 
          laughter.

                                    KANE
                        It's not funny.

          He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.  Susan tries to 
          control her laughter, but not very successfully.  Kane glares 
          at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm sorry, mister - but you do 
                        look awful funny.

          Suddenly, the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw.

                                    SUSAN
                        Ow!

                                    KANE
                        What's the matter with you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Toothache.

                                    KANE
                        Hmm!

          He has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief.

                                    SUSAN
                        You've got some on your face.

                                    KANE
                        If these sidewalks were kept in 
                        condition - instead of the money
                        going to some cheap grafter -

          Susan starts to laugh again.

                                    KANE
                        What's funny now?

                                    SUSAN
                        You are.  You look like you've 
                        been making mud pies.

          In the middle of her smile, the pain returns.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                    KANE
                        You're no Venus de Milo.

                                    SUSAN
                               (points to the 
                               downstair window)
                        If you want to come in and wash 
                        your face -  I can get you some 
                        hot water to get that dirt off
                        your trousers -

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

          Susan starts, with Kane following her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -

          It's in moderate disorder.  The Mansbach gas lights are on.  
          It's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're 
          entitled to in 1910, for $5.00 a week including breakfast.

          There is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few 
          personal belongings on the chiffonier.  These include a 
          photograph of a gent and lady, obviously Susan's parents, and 
          a few objets d'art.  One, "At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game 
          at Coney Island," and - perhaps this is part of the Japanese 
          loot - the glass globe with the snow scene Kane was holding in 
          his hand in the first sequence.

          Susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over 
          her arm.  Kane is waiting for her.  She doesn't close the door.

                                    SUSAN
                               (by way of 
                               explanation)
                        My landlady prefers me to keep 
                        this door open when I have a 
                        gentleman caller.
                               (starts to put the 
                               basin down)
                        She's a very decent woman.
                               (making a face)
                        Ow!

          Kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the 
          chiffonier.  To do this, he has to shove the photograph to one 
          side of the basin.  Susan grabs the photograph as it is about 
          to fall over.

                                    SUSAN
                        Hey, you should be more careful.
                        That's my ma and pa.

                                    KANE
                        I'm sorry.  They live here, too?

                                    SUSAN
                        No.  They've passed on.

          Again she puts her hand to her jaw.

                                    KANE
                        Where's the soap?

                                    SUSAN
                        In the water.

          Kane fishes the soap out of the water.  It is slippery, however, 
          and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it 
          falls to the floor.  Susan laughs as he bends over.

                                    KANE
                               (starting to wash 
                               his hands)
                        You're very easily amused.

                                    SUSAN
                        I always like to see the funny 
                        side of things.  No sense crying 
                        when you don't have to.  And you're 
                        so funny.  Looking at you, I forget 
                        all about my toothache.

          Her face distorts in pain again.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                    KANE
                        I can't stay here all night chasing 
                        your pain away.

                                    SUSAN
                               (laughs)
                        I know...  But you do look so silly.

          Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot 
          open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.

                                    KANE
                        Where's the towel?

                                    SUSAN
                        On the chiffonier.  Here.

                                    KANE
                               (rubs his face dry)
                        Thanks.

                                    SUSAN
                               (on her way to closet)
                        I've got a brush in the closet.  
                        As soon as the mud on your trousers 
                        is all dry - you just brush it 
                        off.

                                    KANE
                        I'll get these streets fixed, if 
                        it's the last thing I do.

          Susan comes out of the closet.  She holds out the brush with 
          her left hand, her right hand to her jaw in real distress.

                                    KANE
                               (takes the brush)
                        You are in pain, aren't you, you 
                        poor kid?

          Susan can't stand it anymore and sits down in a chair, bent 
          over, whimpering a bit.

                                    KANE
                               (brushing himself)
                        Wish there was something I could -

          He stops and thinks.  Susan, her face averted, is still trying 
          hard not to cry.

                                    KANE
                        I've got an idea, young lady.
                               (there is no response)
                        Turn around and look at me.
                               (there is still no 
                               response)
                        I said, turn around and look at 
                        me, young lady.

          Slowly, Susan turns.

                                    KANE
                        Did you ever see anybody wiggle 
                        both his ears at the same time?

          It takes a second for Susan to adapt herself to this.

                                    KANE
                        Watch closely!
                               (he wiggles his 
                               ears)
                        It took me two solid years at the 
                        finest boys' school in the world 
                        to learn that trick.  The fellow 
                        who taught me is President of 
                        Venezuela now.

          He's still wiggling his ears as Susan starts to smile.

                                    KANE
                        That's it!  Smile!

          Susan smiles, very broadly.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -

          Closeup of a duck, camera pulls back showing it to be a 
          shadowgraph on the wall, made by Kane, who is now in his shirt 
          sleeves.  It is about an hour later than preceding sequence.

                                    SUSAN
                               (hesitatingly)
                        A chicken?

                                    KANE
                        No.  But you're close.

                                    SUSAN
                        A rooster?

                                    KANE
                        You're getting farther away all 
                        the time.  It's a duck.

                                    SUSAN
                        Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this 
                        takes a lot of nerve, but - who 
                        are you?  I mean - I'm pretty 
                        ignorant, guess you caught on to 
                        that -

                                    KANE
                               (looks squarely at 
                               her)
                        You really don't know who I am?

                                    SUSAN
                        No.  That is, I bet it turns out 
                        I've heard your name a million 
                        times, only you know how it is -

                                    KANE
                        But you like me, don't you?  Even 
                        though you don't know who I am?

                                    SUSAN
                        You've been wonderful!  I can't 
                        tell you how glad I am you're here, 
                        I don't know many people and -
                               (she stops)

                                    KANE
                        And I know too many people.  
                        Obviously, we're both lonely.
                               (he smiles)
                        Would you like to know where I was 
                        going tonight - when you ran into 
                        me and ruined my Sunday clothes?

                                    SUSAN
                        I didn't run into you and I bet 
                        they're not your Sunday clothes.
                        You've probably got a lot of 
                        clothes.

                                    KANE
                               (as if defending 
                               himself from a 
                               terrible onslaught)
                        I was only joking!
                               (pauses)
                        This evening I was on my way to
                        the Western Manhattan Warehouses -
                        in search of my youth.

          Susan is bewildered.

                                    KANE
                        You see, my mother died, too - a 
                        long time ago.  Her things were 
                        put into storage out west because 
                        I had no place to put them then.
                        I still haven't.  But now I've 
                        sent for them just the same.  And 
                        tonight I'd planned to make a sort 
                        of sentimental journey -
                               (slowly)
                        - to the scenes of my youth - my 
                        childhood, I suppose - to look 
                        again at -
                               (he changes mood 
                               slightly)
                        and now -

          Kane doesn't finish.  He looks at Susan.  Silence.

                                    KANE
                        Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles 
                        Foster Kane was born in New Salem,
                        Colorado in eighteen six -
                               (he stops on the 
                               word "sixty" - 
                               obviously a little 
                               embarrassed)
                        I run a couple of newspapers.  How 
                        about you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, me -

                                    KANE
                        How old did you say you were?

                                    SUSAN
                               (very bright)
                        I didn't say.

                                    KANE
                        I didn't think you did.  If you 
                        had, I wouldn't have asked you 
                        again, because I'd have remembered.
                        How old?

                                    SUSAN
                        Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in 
                        August.

                                    KANE
                               (looks at her 
                               silently for a 
                               moment)
                        That's a ripe old age -  What do 
                        you do?

                                    SUSAN
                        I work at Seligman's.

                                    KANE
                        Is that what you want to do?

                                    SUSAN
                        I want to be a singer.
                               (she thinks for a 
                               moment)
                        I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for 
                        me.

                                    KANE
                               (sympathetically)
                        What happened to the singing?
                        You're not in a show, are you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother 
                        always thought - she used to talk 
                        about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine!
                        An American girl, for one thing -
                        and then my voice isn't really 
                        that kind anyway, it's just that 
                        Mother - you know what mothers are 
                        like.

          A sudden look comes over Kane's face.

                                    KANE
                        Yes -

                                    SUSAN
                        As a matter of fact, I do sing a 
                        little.

                                    KANE
                               (points to the piano)
                        Would you sing for me?

                                    SUSAN
                               (bashful)
                        Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me 
                        sing.

                                    KANE
                        Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, I -

                                    KANE
                        Don't tell me your toothache is 
                        bothering you again?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, no, that's all gone.

                                    KANE
                        Then you have no alibi at all.
                        Please sing.

          Susan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and 
          sings a polite song.  Sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, 
          untrained voice.  Kane listens.  He is relaxed, at ease with 
          the world.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN -

          Susan tosses down a drink, then goes on with her story.

                                    SUSAN
                        I did a lot of singing after that.
                        I sang for Charlie -  I sang for 
                        teachers at a hundred bucks an 
                        hour - the teachers got that, I
                        didn't -

                                    THOMPSON
                        What did you get?

                                    SUSAN
                               (glares at him 
                               balefully)
                        What do you mean?

          Thompson doesn't answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        I didn't get a thing.  Just the 
                        music lessons.  That's all there 
                        was to it.

                                    THOMPSON
                        He married you, didn't he?

                                    SUSAN
                        He was in love with me.  But he 
                        never told me so until after it 
                        all came out in the papers about 
                        us - and he lost the election and
                        that Norton woman divorced him.

                                    THOMPSON
                        What about that apartment?

                                    SUSAN
                        He wanted me to be comfortable -
                        Oh, why should I bother?  You don't 
                        believe me, but it's true.  It 
                        just happens to be true.  He was 
                        really interested in my voice.
                               (sharply)
                        What are you smiling for?  What do 
                        you think he built that opera house 
                        for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't
                        want to sing.  It was his idea -
                        everything was his idea - except 
                        my leaving him.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. LIVING ROOM OF KANE'S HOUSE IN NEW YORK - DAY -

          Susan is singing.  Matisti, her voice teacher, is playing the 
          piano.  Kane is seated nearby.  Matisti stops.

                                    MATISTI
                        Impossible!  Impossible!

                                    KANE
                        Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane 
                        your opinion of her talents.
                        You're supposed to train her voice.
                        Nothing more.

                                    MATISTI
                               (sweating)
                        But, it is impossible.  I will be 
                        the laughingstock of the musical
                        world!  People will say -

                                    KANE
                        If you're interested in what people 
                        say, Signor Matisti, I may be able 
                        to enlighten you a bit.  The 
                        newspapers, for instance.  I'm an 
                        authority on what the papers will 
                        say, Signor Matisti, because I own 
                        eight of them between here and San 
                        Francisco...  It's all right, dear.
                        Signor Matisti is going to listen 
                        to reason.  Aren't you, maestro?
                               (he looks him square 
                               in the eyes)

                                    MATISTI
                        Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -

                                    KANE
                        You can't.

          There is a silence.  Matisti rises.

                                    KANE
                        I knew you'd see it my way.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT -

          It is the same opening night - it is the same moment as before - 
          except taht the camera is now upstage angling toward the 
          audience.  The curtain is down.  We see the same tableau as 
          before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive 
          principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.  
          As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause 
          (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, 
          the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the 
          music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly 
          alone.  The curtain rises.  The glare of the footlights jump 
          into the image.  The curtain is now out of the picture and 
          Susan starts to sing.  Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, 
          containing the anxious face of the prompter.  Beyond that, out 
          in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his 
          task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer.  
          Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms 
          for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness.

          Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening.

          Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice 
          from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of 
          thing that often happens in a theatre -

                                    THE VOICE
                        - really pathetic.

          Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but 
          hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as 
          Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume.

          Closeup of Susan's face - singing.

          Closeup of Kane's face - listening.

          There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding 
          as little as possible.  Kane still looks.  Then, near the 
          camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding 
          very, very loudly.  Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and 
          Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their 
          palms together.  The curtain is falling - as we can see by the 
          light which shutters down off their faces.

          The stage from Kane's angle.

          The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it.  Still, the 
          polite applause dying fast.  Nobody comes out for a bow.

          Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily.  Suddenly he starts to 
          applaud furiously.

          The stage from the audience again.

          Susan appears for her bow.  She can hardly walk.  There is a 
          little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly.

          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes 
          on Susan.

          The stage again.

          Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains.  The 
          light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on.

          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. STUDY - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - DAY -

          Some weeks later.  Susan, in a negligee, is at the window.  
          There are the remains of her breakfast tray on a little table.

                                    SUSAN
                        You don't propose to have yourself 
                        made ridiculous?  What about me?
                        I'm the one that has to do the 
                        singing.  I'm the one that gets 
                        the razzberries.
                               (pauses)
                        Last week, when I was shopping, 
                        one of the salesgirls did an 
                        imitation of me for another girl.  
                        She thought I didn't see her, but -  
                        Charlie, you might as well make up 
                        your mind to it.  This is one thing 
                        you're not going to have your own 
                        way about.  I can't sing and you 
                        know it -  Why can't you just -

          Kane rises and walks toward her.  There is cold menace in his 
          walk.  Susan shrinks a little as he draws closer to her.

                                    KANE
                        My reasons satisfy me, Susan.  You 
                        seem unable to understand them.  I 
                        will not tell them to you again.
                               (he is very close 
                               to her)
                        You will continue with your singing.

          His eyes are relentlessly upon her.  She sees something in 
          them that frightens her.  She nods her head slowly, indicating 
          surrender.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          Front page of the "San Francisco Enquirer" containing a large 
          portrait of Susan as Thais (as before).  It is announced that 
          Susan will open an independent season in San Francisco in 
          "Thais."  The picture remains constant but the names of the 
          papers change from New York to St. Louis, to Los Angeles to 
          Cleveland, to Denver to Philadelphia - all "Enquirers."

          During all this, on the soundtrack, Susan's voice is heard 
          singing her aria very faintly and far away, her voice cracking 
          a little.

          At the conclusion of this above, Susan has finished her song, 
          and there is the same mild applause as before - over the sound 
          of this, one man loudly applauding.  This fades out as we -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - LATE NIGHT -

          The camera angles across the bed and Susan's form towards the 
          door, from the other side of which voices can be heard.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Let's have your keys, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND'S VOICE
                        Yes, sir.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        The key must be in the other side.
                               (pause)
                        We'll knock the door down, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND'S VOICE
                               (calling)
                        Mrs. Kane -

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Do what I say.

          The door crashes open, light floods in the room, revealing 
          Susan, fully dressed, stretched out on the bed, one arm dangling 
          over the side.  Kane rushes to her.

                                    KANE
                        Get Dr. Corey.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir.

          He rushes out.  Susan is breathing, but heavily.  Kane loosens 
          the lace collar at her throat.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT -

          A little later.  All the lights are lit.  Susan, in a nightgown, 
          is in bed, asleep.  Raymond and a nurse are just leaving the 
          room, Raymond closing the door quietly behind him.  Dr. Corey 
          rises.

                                    DR. COREY
                        She'll be perfectly all right in a 
                        day or two, Mr. Kane.

          Kane nods.  He has a small bottle in his hand.

                                    DR. COREY
                        The nurse has complete instructions, 
                        but if you care to talk to me at 
                        any time, I should be only too 
                        glad -  I shall be here in the 
                        morning.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you.  I can't imagine how 
                        Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly 
                        mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner 
                        gave her is in a somewhat larger 
                        bottle -  I suppose the strain of 
                        preparing for her trip has excited 
                        and confused her.

                                    DR. COREY
                        I'm sure that's it.
                               (he starts out)

                        There are no objections to my 
                        staying here with her, are there?

                                    DR. COREY
                        Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to 
                        be here, too.

                                    KANE
                        Of course.

          Dr. Corey leaves.  Kane settles himself in a chair next to the 
          bed, looking at Susan.  In a moment, the nurse enters, goes to 
          a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - DAY -

          Susan, utterly spent, is lying flat on her back in her bed.  
          Kane is in the chair beside her.  The nurse is out of the room.

                                    SUSAN
                               (in a voice that 
                               comes from far 
                               away)
                        I couldn't make you see how I felt, 
                        Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I 
                        couldn't go threw with singing 
                        again.  You don't know what it 
                        means to feel - to know that people - 
                        that an audience don't want you.  
                        That if you haven't got what they 
                        want - a real voice -
                        they just don't care about you.  
                        Even when they're polite - and 
                        they don't laugh or get restless 
                        or - you know...  They don't want 
                        you.  They just -

                                    KANE
                               (angrily)
                        That's when you've got to fight 
                        them.  That's when you've got to 
                        make them.  That's -

          Susan's head turns and she looks at him silently with pathetic 
          eyes.

                                    KANE
                        I'm sorry.
                               (he leans over to 
                               pat her hand)
                        You won't have to fight them 
                        anymore.
                               (he smiles a little)
                        It's their loss.

          Gratefully, Susan, with difficulty, brings her other hand over 
          to cover his.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF XANADU - HALF BUILT

          INT. THE GRAND HALL IN XANADU -

          Closeup of an enormous jigsaw puzzle.  A hand is putting in 
          the last piece.  Camera moves back to reveal jigsaw puzzle 
          spread out on the floor.

          Susan is on the floor before her jigsaw puzzle.  Kane is in an 
          easy chair.  Behind them towers the massive Renaissance 
          fireplace.  It is night and Baroque candelabra illuminates the 
          scene.

                                    SUSAN
                               (with a sigh)
                        What time is it?

          There is no answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie!  I said, what time is it?

                               (looks up - consults 
                               his watch)
                        Half past eleven.

                                    SUSAN
                        I mean in New York.

                        Half past eleven.

                        At night?

                                    KANE
                        Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to 
                        press.

                                    SUSAN
                               (sarcastically)
                        Hurray for the bulldog!
                               (sighs)
                        Half past eleven!  The shows have 
                        just let out.  People are going to 
                        night clubs and restaurants.  Of 
                        course, we're different.  We live 
                        in a palace - at the end of the 
                        world.

                                    KANE
                        You always said you wanted to live 
                        in a palace.

                                    SUSAN
                        Can't we go back, Charlie?

          Kane looks at her smilingly and turns back to his work.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie -

          There is no answer.

          Another picture puzzle.

          Camera pulls back to show Kane and Susan in much the same 
          positions as before, except that they are older.

                                    KANE
                        One thing I've never been able to 
                        understand, Susan.  How do you 
                        know you haven't done them before?

          Susan shoots him an angry glance.  She isn't amused.

                                    SUSAN
                        It makes a whole lot more sense 
                        than collecting Venuses.

                                    KANE
                        You may be right -  I sometimes 
                        wonder - but you get into the
                        habit -

                                    SUSAN
                               (snapping)
                        It's not a habit.  I do it because 
                        I like it.

                                    KANE
                        I was referring to myself.
                               (pauses)
                        I thought we might have a picnic 
                        tomorrow - it might be a nice change 
                        after the Wild West party tonight.  
                        Invite everybody to go to the

                               (throws down a piece 
                               of the jigsaw puzzle 
                               and rises)
                        Invite everybody!  Order everybody, 
                        you mean, and make them sleep in 
                        tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents 
                        when they have a nice room of their
                        own - with their own bath, where 
                        they know where everything is?

          Kane has looked at her steadily, not hostilely.

                                    KANE
                        I thought we might invite everybody 
                        to go on a picnic tomorrow.  Stay 
                        at Everglades overnight.
                               (he pats her lightly 
                               on the shoulder)
                        Please see that the arrangements 
                        are made, Susan.

          Kane turns away - to Bernstein.

                                    KANE
                        You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein.

          On the soundtrack we hear the following lines of dialogue:

                                    BERNSTEIN'S VOICE
                               (embarrased)

          During this, camera holds on closeup of Susan's face.  She is 
          very angry.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Two real beds have been set up on each side of the tent.  A 
          rather classy dressing table is in the rear, at which Susan is 
          preparing for bed.  Kane, in his shirt-sleeves, is in an easy 
          chair, reading.  Susan is very sullen.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not going to put up with it.

          Kane turns to look at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        I mean it.

                               flicker on Kane's 
                               face)
                        Oh, I know I always say I mean it, 
                        and then I don't - or you get me 
                        so don't do what I say I'm going 
                        to - but -

                               (interrupting)
                        You're in a tent, darling.  You're 
                        not at home.  And I can hear you 
                        very well if you just talk in a

                        I'm not going to have my guests

                               (in a rage)
                        - if people want to bring a drink 
                        or two along on a picnic, that's
                        their business.  You've got no 
                        right -

                        as you're concerned, Susan.

                        all by myself - or I ought to be.  
                        I was once.  Sometimes you get me 
                        to believing I never was.

                        I'll discuss what's on my mind

                        what you want.

                        What you want me to want, you mean.
                        What you've decided I ought to 
                        have - what you'd want if you were 
                        me.  But you've never given me

                        Susan, I really think -

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, I don't mean the things you've 
                        given me - that don't mean anything 
                        to you.  What's the difference 
                        between giving me a bracelet or 
                        giving somebody else a hundred 
                        thousand dollars for a statue you're 
                        going to keep crated up and never 
                        look at?  It's only money.  It 
                        doesn't mean anything.  You're not 
                        really giving anything that belongs 
                        to you, that you care about.

                                    KANE
                               (he has risen)
                        Susan, I want you to stop this.
                        And right now!

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, I'm not going to stop it.  
                        I'm going to say exactly what I 
                        think.
                               (she screams)
                        You've never given me anything.  
                        You've tried to buy me into giving 
                        you something.  You're -
                               (a sudden notion)
                        - it's like you were bribing me!  
                        That's what it's been from the 
                        first moment I met you.  No matter 
                        how much it cost you - your time, 
                        your money - that's what you've 
                        done with everybody you've ever 
                        known.  Tried to bribe them!

                                    KANE
                        Susan!

          She looks at him, with no lessening of her passion.

                                    KANE
                        You're talking an incredible amount 
                        of nonsense, Susan.
                               (quietly)
                        Whatever I do -  I do - because I 
                        love you.

                                    SUSAN
                        Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me 
                        or anybody else!  You want to be 
                        loved - that's all you want!  I'm 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you 
                        want - just name it and it's yours!
                        Only love me!  Don't expect me to
                        love you -

          Without a word, Kane slaps her across the face.  They look at 
          each other.

                                    SUSAN
                        You - you hit me.

          Kane continues to look at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        You'll never have another chance 
                        to hit me again.
                               (pauses)
                        Never knew till this minute -

                                    KANE
                        Susan, it seems to me -

                                    SUSAN
                        Don't tell me you're sorry.

                                    KANE
                        I'm not sorry.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm going to leave you.

                                    KANE
                        No, you're not.

                                    SUSAN
                               (nods)
                        Yes.

          They look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way.  
          In fact, the camera on Kane's face shows the beginning of a 
          startled look, as of one who sees something unfamiliar and 
          unbelievable.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S STUDY - XANADU - DAY -

          Kane is a the window looking out.  He turns as he hears Raymond 
          enter.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Mrs. Kane would like to see you, 
                        Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        All right.

          Raymond waits as Kane hesitates.

                                    KANE
                        Is Mrs. Kane -
                               (he can't finish)

                                    RAYMOND
                        Marie has been packing since 
                        morning, Mr. Kane.

          Kane impetuously walks past him out of the room.

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - XANADU - DAY -

          Packed suitcases are on the floor, Susan is completely dressed 
          for travelling.  Kane bursts into the room.

                                    SUSAN
                        Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.  He 
                        can get the bags.

                                    MARIE
                        Yes, Mrs. Kane.

          She leaves.  Kane closes the door behind her.

                                    KANE
                        Have you gone completely crazy?

          Susan looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        Don't you realize that everybody 
                        here is going to know about this?
                        That you've packed your bags and
                        ordered the car and -

                                    SUSAN
                        - And left?  Of course they'll
                        hear.  I'm not saying goodbye -
                        except to you - but I never imagined 
                        that people wouldn't know.

          Kane is standing against the door as if physically barring her 
          way.

                                    KANE
                        I won't let you go.

                                    SUSAN
                        You can't stop me.

          Kane keeps looking at her.  Susan reaches out her hand.

                                    SUSAN
                        Goodbye, Charlie.

                                    KANE
                               (suddenly)
                        Don't go, Susan.

                                    SUSAN
                        Let's not start all over again, 
                        Charlie.  We've said everything 
                        that can be said.

                                    KANE
                        Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!

          He has lost all pride.  Susan stops.  She is affected by this.

                                    KANE
                        You mustn't go, Susan.  
                        Everything'll be exactly the way 
                        you want it.  Not the way I think 
                        you want it - by your way.  Please, 
                        Susan - Susan!

          She is staring at him.  She might weaken.

                                    KANE
                        Don't go, Susan!  You mustn't go!
                               (almost blubbering)
                        You - you can't do this to me,
                        Susan -

          It's as if he had thrown ice water into her face.  She freezes.

                                    SUSAN
                        I see - it's you that this is being 
                        done to!  It's not me at all.  Not 
                        how I feel.  Not what it means to 
                        me.
                               (she laughs)
                        I can't do this to you!
                               (she looks at him)
                        Oh, yes I can.

          She walks out, past Kane, who turns to watch her go, like a 
          very tired old man.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - NIGHT -

          Susan and Thompson at a table.  There is silence between them 
          for a moment.

                                    SUSAN
                        In case you've never heard of how 
                        I lost all my money - and it was
                        plenty, believe me -

                                    THOMPSON
                        The last ten years have been tough 
                        on a lot of people.

                                    SUSAN
                        They haven't been tough on me.  I 
                        just lost my money.  But when I 
                        compare these last ten years with
                        the twenty I spent with him -

                                    THOMPSON
                        I feel kind of sorry for him, all
                        the same -

                                    SUSAN
                               (harshly)
                        Don't you think I do?
                               (pause)
                        You say you're going down to Xanadu?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Monday, with some of the boys from 
                        the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants 
                        the whole place photographed 
                        carefully - all that art stuff.  
                        We run a picture magazine, you 
                        know -

                                    SUSAN
                        I know.  If you're smart, you'll 
                        talk to Raymond.  That's the butler.
                        You can learn a lot from him.  He 
                        knows where the bodies are buried.

          She shivers.  The dawn light from the skylight above has grown 
          brighter, making the artificial light in the night club look 
          particularly ghastly, revealing mercilessly every year of 
          Susan's age.

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, what do you know?  It's 
                        morning already.
                               (looks at him)
                        You must come around and tell me 
                        the story of your life sometime.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          An open door shows the pantry, which is dark.  Thompson and 
          Raymond are at a table.  There is a pitcher of beer and a plate 
          of sandwiches before them.  Raymond drinks a glass of beer and 
          settles back.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to 
                        handle the old man.  He was kind 
                        of queer, but I knew how to handle 
                        him.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Queer?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy 
                        those last years - he didn't have
                        much reason to be -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CORRIDOR AND TELEGRAPH OFFICE - XANADU - NIGHT -

          Raymond walking rapidly along corridor.  He pushes open a door.  
          At a desk in a fairly elaborate telegraph office sits a wireless 
          operator named Fred.  Near him at a telephone switchboard sits 
          a female operator named Katherine (not that it matters).

                                    RAYMOND
                               (reading)
                        Mr. Charles Foster Kane announced 
                        today that Mrs. Charles Foster 
                        Kane has left Xanadu, his Florida 
                        home, under the terms of a peaceful 
                        and friendly agreement with the 
                        intention of filing suit for divorce 
                        at an early date.  Mrs. Kane said 
                        that she does not intend to return 
                        to the operatic career which she 
                        gave up a few years after her 
                        marriage, at Mr.  Kane's request.  
                        Signed, Charles Foster Kane.

          Fred finishes typing and then looks up.

                        Okay.

          There is the sound of the buzzer on the switchboard.  Katherine 
          puts in a plug and answers the call.

                                    KATHERINE
                        Yes ... yes...  Mrs. Tinsdall -
                        Very well.
                               (turns to Raymond)
                        It's the housekeeper.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes?

                                    KATHERINE
                        She says there's some sort of 
                        disturbance up in Mrs. Alexander's 
                        room.  She's afraid to go in.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU - NIGHT -

          The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near 
          the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.  From inside 
          can be heard a terrible banging and crashing.  Raymond hurries 
          into scene, opens the door and goes in.

          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

          Kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is 
          literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures, hooks and 
          all off the wall, smashing them to bits - ugly, gaudy pictures - 
          Susie's pictures in Susie's bad taste.  Off of occasional 
          tables, bureaus, he sweeps Susie's whorish accumulation of 
          bric-a-brac.

          Raymond stands in the doorway watching him.  Kane says nothing.  
          He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, 
          still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits.  The curtains (too 
          frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single 
          gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads 
          of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and 
          dashes it across the room.  Finally he stops.  Susie's cozy 
          little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him.

          He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights 
          on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice.  
          Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with 
          the snowstorm in it.  He yanks it down.  Something made of 
          china breaks, but not the glass ball.  It bounces on the carpet 
          and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry.  His eye follows 
          it.  He stoops to pick it up - can't make it.  Raymond picks 
          it up for him; hands it to him.  Kane takes it sheepishly - 
          looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the corridor.

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

          Kane comes out of the door.  Mrs. Tinsdall has been joined now 
          by a fairly sizable turnout of servants.  They move back away 
          from Kane, staring at him.  Raymond is in the doorway behind 
          Kane.  Kane looks at the glass ball.

                                    KANE
                               (without turning)
                        Close the door, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir.
                               (he closes it)

                                    KANE
                        Lock it - and keep it locked.

          Raymond locks the door and comes to his side.  There is a long 
          pause - servants staring in silence.  Kane gives the glass 
          ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.

                                    KANE
                        Raymond -
                               (he is almost in a 
                               trance)

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir -

          One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up.  Kane 
          shakes the ball again.  Another flurry of snow.  He watches 
          the flakes settle - then looks up.  Finally, taking in the 
          pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the 
          glass ball in his coat pocket.  He speaks very quietly to 
          Raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself.

                                    KANE
                        Keep it locked.

          He slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way 
          to let him pass, and watching him as he goes.  He is an old, 
          old man!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S CHAPEL - XANADU - LATE AFTERNOON -

          As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across 
          the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and 
          mother - (marked: James Kane - 18- TO 19-; Mary Kane - 18- TO 
          19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of 
          Kane's son.  A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes 
          are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt.  
          Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on.  The men strain 
          and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor.  The men now 
          place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words:

          CHARLES FOSTER KANE II.

          1907 - 1938

                                    ONE OF THE WORKMEN
                        Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able
                        to cement it till tommorrow.  We -

          Kane looks right through him.  Raymond cuts him short.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Okay.

          The men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel.  Kane 
          raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall.  It is 
          a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank 
          place which will be occupied by Kane himself.

                                    KANE
                        Do you like poetry, Raymond?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Can't say, sir.

                                    KANE
                        Mrs. Kane liked poetry -

          Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone 
          indeed - not to say off his trolley.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Not my wife - not either of them.

          He looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked 
          "MARY KANE."

                                    RAYMOND
                               (catching on)
                        Oh, yes, sir.

                                    KANE
                               (looking back up at 
                               the wall)
                        Do you know what that is?

                                    RAYMOND
                               (more his keeper 
                               than his butler 
                               now)
                        It's a wall you bought in China, 
                        Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Persia.  It belonged to a king.

                                    RAYMOND
                        How did you get him to part with 
                        it, Mr. Kane?

                                    KANE
                        He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do 
                        you know what it means?

                                    RAYMOND
                        No, I don't, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        I didn't used to be afraid of it.

          A short pause.  His eyes still on the wall, but looking through 
          it, Kane quotes the translation.

                                    KANE
                        The drunkeness of youth has passed 
                        like a fever, And yet I saw many 
                        things, Seeing my glory in the 
                        days of my glory, I thought my 
                        power eternal And the days of my 
                        life Fixed surely in the years But 
                        a whisper came to me From Him who 
                        dies not.  I called my tributary 
                        kings together And those who were 
                        proud rulers under me, I opened 
                        the boxes of my treasure to them, 
                        saying: "Take hills of gold, 
                        moutains of silver, And give me 
                        only one more day upon the earth."
                        But they stood silent, Looking 
                        upon the ground; So that I died 
                        And Death came to sit upon my 
                        throne.  O sons of men You see a 
                        stranger upon the road, You call 
                        to him and he does not step.  He 
                        is your life Walking towards time, 
                        Hurrying to meet the kings of India 
                        and China.
                               (quoting)
                        O sons of men You are caught in 
                        the web of the world And the spider 
                        Nothing waits behind it.  Where 
                        are the men with towering hopes?
                        They have changed places with owls, 
                        Owls who have lived in tombs And 
                        now inhabit a palace.

          Kane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it.  
          Raymond looks at him.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          Thompson and Raymond.  Raymond has finished his beer.

                                    RAYMOND
                               (callously)
                        That's the whole works, right up 
                        to date.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes and no.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (getting to his 
                               feet)
                        Well, thanks a lot.

                                    RAYMOND
                        See what I mean?  He was a little 
                        gone in the head - the last couple 
                        of years, anyway - but I knew how 
                        to handle him.
                               (rises)
                        That "Rosebud" - that don't mean 
                        anything.  I heard him say it.
                        He just said "Rosebud" and then he 
                        dropped that glass ball and it 
                        broke on the floor.  He didn't say 
                        anything about that, so I knew he 
                        was dead - He said all kind of 
                        things I couldn't make out.  But I 
                        knew how to take care of him.

          Thompson doesn't answer.

                                    RAYMOND
                        You can go on asking questions if 
                        you want to.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (coldly)
                        We're leaving tonight.  As soon as 
                        they're through photographing
                        the stuff -

          Thompson has risen.  Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the 
          door, opening it for him.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Allow yourself plenty of time.  
                        The train stops at the Junction On 
                        signal - but they don't like to 
                        wait.  Not now.  I can remember 
                        when they'd wait all day ... if 
                        Mr. Kane said so.

          Raymond ushes Thompson into

          INT. THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, 
          but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, 
          some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and 
          small, are piled pell mell all over the place.  Furniture, 
          statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous 
          value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair 
          and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same 
          story.  Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows 
          of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, 
          rustling the papers.

          In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant 
          are busy photographing the sundry objects.  The floor is 
          littered with burnt-out flash bulbs.  They continue their work 
          throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a 
          flash bulb goes off.  In addition to the Photographer and his 
          Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second 
          and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and 
          Raymond.

          The Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing 
          somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph.  
          A flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer has just photographed 
          a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive.  
          The Assistant consults a label on the back of it.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        NO. 9182

          The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        "Nativity" - attributed to 
                        Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, 
                        cost 45,000 lira.  Got that?

                        All right!  Next!  Better get that 
                        statue over there.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        Okay.

          The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their 
          equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the 
          hall.

                                    RAYMOND
                        What do you think all that is worth, 
                        Mr. Thompson?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Millions - if anybody wants it.

                                    RAYMOND
                        The banks are out of luck, eh?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear 
                        all right.

                        Okay.

                               on the fanny)
                        That's a lot of money to pay for a 
                        dame without a head.

                        Okay.

          A flashlight bulb goes off.

                                    SECOND ASSISTANT
                        We're all set to get everything.  
                        The junk as well as the art.

          Thompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful 
          of little pieces of cardboard.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        What's that?

                                    RAYMOND
                        It's a jigsaw puzzle.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        We got a lot of those.  There's a 
                        Burmese Temple and three Spanish 
                        ceilings down the hall.

          Raymond laughs.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Yeah, all in crates.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        There's a part of a Scotch castle 
                        over there, but we haven't bothered 
                        to unwrap it.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        I wonder how they put all those 
                        pieces together?

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Put it over by that statue.  It'll 
                        make a good setup.

                                    GIRL
                               (calling out)
                        Who is she anyway?

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Venus.  She always is.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        He sure liked to collect things, 
                        didn't he?

                                    RAYMOND
                        He went right on buying - right up 
                        to the end.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Anything and everything - he was a 
                        regular crow.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        wonder -  You put all this together -
                        the palaces and the paintings and 
                        the toys and everything - what 
                        would it spell?

          Thompson has turned around.  He is facing the camera for the 
          first time.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Charles Foster Kane.

          Another flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer turns to Thompson 
          with a grin.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                               (to the dancers)
                        Turn that thing off, will you?  
                        It's driving me nuts!  What's 
                        Rosebud?

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Kane's last words, aren't they, 
                        Jerry?
                               (to the Third 
                               Newspaperman)
                        That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, 
                        Jerry?  Did you ever find out what 
                        it means, Jerry?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No, I didn't.

          The music has stopped.  The dancers have come over to Thompson.

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Say, what did you find out about 
                        him, anyway, Jerry?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Not much.

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Well, what have you been doing?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Playing with a jigsaw puzzle -   I 
                        talked to a lot of people who knew 
                        him.

                                    GIRL
                        What do they say?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well - it's become a very clear 
                        picture.  He was the most honest 
                        man who ever lived, with a streak 
                        of crookedness a yard wide.  He 
                        was a liberal and a reactionary; 
                        he was tolerant - "Live and Let 
                        Live" - that was his motto.  But 
                        he had no use for anybody who 
                        disagreed with him on any point, 
                        no matter how small it was.  He 
                        was a loving husband and a good 
                        father - and both his wives left 
                        him and his son got himself killed 
                        about as shabbily as you can do 
                        it.  He had a gift for friendship 
                        such as few men have - he broke 
                        his oldest friend's heart like 
                        you'd throw away a cigarette
                        you were through with.  Outside of 
                        that -

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Okay, okay.

                                    GIRL
                        What about Rosebud?  Don't you 
                        think that explains anything?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No, I don't.  Not much anway.  
                        Charles Foster Kane was a man who 
                        got everything he wanted, and then 
                        lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was 
                        something he couldn't get or lost.  
                        No, I don't think it explains
                        anything.  I don't think any word 
                        explains a man's life.  No -  I 
                        guess Rosebud is just a piece in a 
                        jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.

          He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his 
          watch.

                                    THOMPSON
                        We'd better get along.  We'll miss 
                        the train.

          He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little 
          sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher 
          with at the opening of the picture.  Camera doesn't close in 
          on this.  It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, 
          picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great 
          hall.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CELLAR - XANADU - NIGHT -

          A large furnace, with an open door, dominates the scene.  Two 
          laborers, with shovels, are shovelling things into the furnace.  
          Raymond is about ten feet away.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Throw that junk in, too.

          Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated.  It is mostly 
          bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc.  The sled is on 
          top of the pile.  As camera comes close, it shows the faded 
          rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the 
          word "ROSEBUD" across it.  The laborer drops his shovel, takes 
          the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace.  The flames 
          start to devour it.

          EXT. XANADU - NIGHT -

          No lights are to be seen.  Smoke is coming from a chimney.

          Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the 
          picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages.  It moves finally 
          through the gates, which close behind it.  As camera pauses 
          for a moment, the letter "K" is prominent in the moonlight.

          Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture 
          the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing.  On the fence 
          is a sign which reads:

          "PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING"

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          EXT. XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE)

          Window, very small in the distance, illuminated.

          All around this is an almost totally black screen.  Now, as 
          the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a 
          postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, 
          cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning 
          sky, enormous iron grille work.  Camera travels up what is now 
          shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the 
          top of it - a huge initial "K" showing darker and darker against 
          the dawn sky.  Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale 
          mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its 
          summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness.

                                     

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL 
          TELLING SOMETHING OF: 

          The literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE.

          Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf 
          Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye 
          can see.  Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and 
          flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when 
          Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly 
          uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good-
          sized mountain, all man-made.  Almost all the land is improved, 
          either through cultivation for farming purposes of through 
          careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.  The 
          castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several 
          genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - 
          dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          GOLF LINKS (MINIATURE)

          Past which we move.  The greens are straggly and overgrown, 
          the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and 
          not seriously tended for a long time.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE)

          Of the Hagenbeck type.  All that now remains, with one 
          exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on 
          which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other 
          and the landscape at large.  (Signs on several of the plots 
          indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.)

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE)

          In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the 
          dawn murk.  He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, 
          looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the 
          distant light glowing in the castle on the hill.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE)

          The idiot pile of sleepy dragons.  Reflected in the muddy water - 
          the lighted window.

          THE LAGOON (MINIATURE)

          The boat landing sags.  An old newspaper floats on the surface 
          of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer."  As it moves 
          across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the 
          window in the castle, closer than before.

          THE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE)

          It is empty.  A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of 
          the tank.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE COTTAGES (MINIATURE)

          In the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle.  As we 
          move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up 
          and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

                                                               DISSOLVE IN:

          A DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE)

          Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds.  We move 
          across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, 
          perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which 
          extends right up to the very wall of the castle.  The 
          landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a 
          long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in 
          perfect shape.  As the camera makes its way through it, towards 
          the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and 
          exotic blooms of all kinds.  The dominating note is one of 
          almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and 
          despairing.  Moss, moss, moss.  Ankor Wat, the night the last 
          King died.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          THE WINDOW (MINIATURE)

          Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame 
          of the screen.  Suddenly, the light within goes out.  This 
          stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has 
          been accompanying the sequence.  In the glass panes of the 
          window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. 
          Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN -

          A very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against 
          the enormous window.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE.  

          An incredible one.  Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too 
          picturesque farmhouse and a snow man.  The jingling of sleigh 
          bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to 
          Indian Temple bells - the music freezes -

           

                                    KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE
                        Rosebud...

          The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained 
          in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores 
          all over the world.  A hand - Kane's hand, which has been 
          holding the ball, relaxes.  The ball falls out of his hand and 
          bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera 
          following.  The ball falls off the last step onto the marble 
          floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first 
          rays of the morning sun.  This ray cuts an angular pattern 
          across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of 
          light as the blinds are pulled across the window.

          The foot of Kane's bed.  The camera very close.  Outlined 
          against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of 
          a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head.  The camera 
          follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at 
          the face after the sheet has covered it.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. OF A MOTION PICTURE PROJECTION ROOM

          On the screen as the camera moves in are the words:

                                   "MAIN TITLE"

          Stirring, brassy music is heard on the soundtrack (which, of 
          course, sounds more like a soundtrack than ours.)

          The screen in the projection room fills our screen as the second 
          title appears:

                                    "CREDITS"

          NOTE:  Here follows a typical news digest short, one of the 
          regular monthly or bi-monthly features, based on public events 
          or personalities.  These are distinguished from ordinary 
          newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed 
          editorial or storyline.  Some of the more obvious 
          characteristics of the "March of Time," for example, as well 
          as other documentary shorts, will be combined to give an 
          authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject.  
          As is the accepted procedure in these short subjects, a narrator 
          is used as well as explanatory titles.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          Series of shots showing various aspects of Xanadu, all as they 
          might be photographed by an ordinary newsreel cameraman - nicely 
          photographed, but not atmospheric to the extreme extent of the

                        history, other names are honored

          Shot of a huge, screen-filling picture of Kane.  Pull back to

          A great number of headlines, set in different types and 
          different styles, obviously from different papers, all 
          announcing Kane's death, all appearing over photographs of 
          Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign 
          languages).  An important item in connection with the headlines 
          is that many of them - positively not all - reveal passionately 
          conflicting opinions about Kane.  Thus, they contain variously 
          the words "patriot," "democrat," "pacifist," "war-monger," 
          "traitor," "idealist," "American," etc.

          Shot of Congressional Investigating Committee (reproduction of

          narration.  Walter P. Thatcher is on the stand.  He is flanked 
          by his son, Walter P. Thatcher Jr., and other partners.  He is 
          being questioned by some Merry Andrew congressmen.  At this 
          moment, a baby alligator has just been placed in his lap, 
          causing considerable confusion and embarrassment.

                                    THATCHER
                        Yes.  My firm had been appointed 
                        trustees by Mrs. Kane for the 
                        fortune, which she had recently 
                        acquired.  It was her wish that I 
                        should take charge of this boy, 
                        Charles Foster Kane.

                                    NARRATOR
                        That same month in Union Square -

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                        Is it not a fact that on that 
                        occasion, the boy personally 
                        attacked you after striking you in 
                        the stomach with a sled?

          Loud laughter and confusion.

                                    THATCHER
                        Mr. Chairman, I will read to this 
                        committee a prepared statement I 
                        have brought with me - and I will 
                        then refuse to answer any further 
                        questions.  Mr.  Johnson, please!

          A young assistant hands him a sheet of paper from a briefcase.

                                    THATCHER
                               (reading it)
                        "With full awareness of the meaning 
                        of my words and the responsibility 
                        of what I am about to say, it is 
                        my considered belief that Mr.  
                        Charles Foster Kane, in every 
                        essence of his social beliefs and
                        by the dangerous manner in which 
                        he has persistently attacked the 
                        American traditions of private 
                        property, initiative and opportunity 
                        for advancement, is - in fact - 
                        nothing more or less than a 
                        Communist."

          Newsreel of Union Square meeting, section of crowd carrying 
          banners urging the boycott of Kane papers.  A speaker is on 
          the platform above the crowd.

                                    SPEAKER
                               (fading in on 
                               soundtrack)
                        - till the words "Charles Foster 
                        Kane" are a menace to every working 
                        man in this land.  He is today 
                        what he has always been and always 
                        will be - A FASCIST!

                                    NARRATOR
                        And yet another opinion - Kane's 
                        own.

          Silent newsreel on a windy platform, flag-draped, in front of 
          the magnificent Enquirer building.  On platform, in full 
          ceremonial dress, is Charles Foster Kane.  He orates silently.

          TITLE: 

          "I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN."  
          CHARLES FOSTER KANE.

          Same locale, Kane shaking hands out of frame.

          Another newsreel shot, much later, very brief, showing Kane, 
          older and much fatter, very tired-looking, seated with his 
          second wife in a nightclub.  He looks lonely and unhappy in 
          the midst of the gaiety.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Twice married, twice divorced - 
                        first to a president's niece, Emily 
                        Norton - today, by her second 
                        marriage, chatelaine of the oldest 
                        of England's stately homes.  Sixteen 
                        years after that - two weeks after
                        his divorce from Emily Norton - 
                        Kane married Susan Alexander, 
                        singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, 
                        New Jersey.

          TITLE: 

          FEW PRIVATE LIVES WERE MORE PUBLIC.

          Period still of Emily Norton (1900).

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Reconstructed silent newsreel.  Kane, Susan, and Bernstein 
          emerging from side doorway of City Hall into a ring of press 
          photographers, reporters, etc.  Kane looks startled, recoils 
          for an instance, then charges down upon the photographers, 
          laying about him with his stick, smashing whatever he can hit.

                                    NARRATOR
                        For wife two, one-time opera singing 
                        Susan Alexander, Kane built 
                        Chicago's Municipal Opera House.  
                        Cost: three million dollars.  
                        Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, 
                        half-finished before she divorced 
                        him, the still unfinished Xanadu.  
                        Cost: no man can say.

          Still of architect's sketch with typically glorified "rendering" 
          of the Chicago Municipal Opera House.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A glamorous shot of the almost-finished Xanadu, a magnificent 
          fairy-tale estate built on a mountain. (1920)

          Then shots of its preparation. (1917)

          Shots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by 
          with tremendous noise.

          Shots of vast dredges, steamshovels.

          Shot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters.

          In quick succession, shots follow each other, some 
          reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from 
          the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc.

                                    NARRATOR
                        One hundred thousand trees, twenty 
                        thousand tons of marble, are the 
                        ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.
                        Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of 
                        the air, the fish of the sea, the 
                        beast of the field and jungle - 
                        two of each; the biggest private 
                        zoo since Noah.  Contents of Kane's 
                        palace: paintings, pictures, 
                        statues, the very stones of many 
                        another palace, shipped to Florida 
                        from every corner of the earth, 
                        from other Kane houses, warehouses, 
                        where they mouldered for years.  
                        Enough for ten museums - the loot 
                        of the world.

          More shots as before, only this time we see (in miniature) a 
          large mountain - at different periods in its development - 
          rising out of the sands.

          Shots of elephants, apes, zebras, etc. being herded, unloaded, 
          shipped, etc. in various ways.

          Shots of packing cases being unloaded from ships, from trains, 
          from trucks, with various kinds of lettering on them (Italian, 
          Arabian, Chinese, etc.) but all consigned to Charles Foster 
          Kane, Xanadu, Florida.

          A reconstructed still of Xanadu - the main terrace.  A group 
          of persons in clothes of the period of 1917.  In their midst, 
          clearly recognizable, are Kane and Susan.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Kane urged his country's entry 
                        into one war, opposed participation 
                        in another.  Swung the election to 
                        one American President at least, 
                        was called another's assassin.  
                        Thus, Kane's papers might never 
                        have survived - had not the 
                        President.

          papers since 1895.

                                    NARRATOR
                        Kane, molder of mass opinion though 
                        he was, in all his life was never 
                        granted elective office by the 
                        voters of his country.  Few U.S. 
                        news publishers have been.
                        Few, like one-time Congressman 
                        Hearst, have ever run for any office - 
                        most know better - conclude with 
                        other political observers that one 
                        man's press has power enough for 
                        himself.  But Kane papers were 
                        once strong indeed, and once the 
                        prize seemed almost his.  In 1910, 
                        as Independent Candidate for 
                        governor, the best elements of the 
                        state behind him - the White House 
                        seemingly the next easy step in a 
                        lightning political career -

          IN POLITICS - ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID, NEVER A BRIDE

          Newsreel shots of great crowds streaming into a building - 
          Madison Square Garden - then shots inside the vast auditorium, 
          at one end of which is a huge picture of Kane.  (1910)

          Shot of box containing the first Mrs. Kane and young Howard 
          Kane, age five.  They are acknowledging the cheers of the crowd.

                        Then, suddenly - less than one 
                        week before election - defeat!  
                        Shameful, ignominious - defeat 
                        that set back for twenty years the 
                        cause of reform in the U.S., forever 
                        cancelled political chances for 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  Then, in the 
                        third year of the Great 
                        Depression...  As to all publishers, 
                        it sometimes must - to Bennett, to 
                        Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper 
                        closes!  For Kane, in four short 
                        years: collapse!
                        Eleven Kane papers, four Kane

                        Then four long years more - alone 
                        in his never-finished, already 
                        decaying, pleasure palace, aloof, 
                        seldom visited, never photographed, 
                        Charles Foster Kane continued to 
                        direct his falling empire ... vainly 
                        attempting to sway, as he once 
                        did, the destinies of a nation 
                        that has ceased to listen to him 
                        ... ceased to trust him...

          SHOTS OF XANADU.  (1940)

          Series of shots, entirely modern, but rather jumpy and obviously 
          bootlegged, showing Kane in a bath chair, swathed in summer 
          rugs, being perambulated through his rose garden, a desolate 
          figure in the sunshine.  (1935)

                                    NARRATOR
                        Last week, death came to sit upon 
                        the throne of America's Kubla Khan - 
                        last week, as it must to all men, 
                        death came to Charles Foster Kane.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Cabinent Photograph (Full Screen) of Kane as an old, old man.  
          This image remains constant on the screen (as camera pulls 
          back, taking in the interior of a dark projection room.

          INT. PROJECTION ROOM - DAY -

          A fairly large one, with a long throw to the screen.  It is 
          dark.

          The image of Kane as an old man remains constant on the screen 
          as camera pulls back, slowly taking in and registering 
          Projection Room.  This action occurs, however, only after the 
          first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken.  The 
          shadows of the men speaking appear as they rise from their 
          chairs - black against the image of Kane's face on the screen.

          NOTE:  These are the editors of a "News Digest" short, and of 
          the Rawlston magazines.  All his enterprises are represented 
          in the projection room, and Rawlston himself, that great man, 
          is present also and will shortly speak up.

          During the entire course of this scene, nobody's face is really 
          seen.  Sections of their bodies are picked out by a table light, 
          a silhouette is thrown on the screen, and their faces and bodies 
          are themselves thrown into silhouette against the brilliant 
          slanting rays of light from the projection room.

          A Third Man is on the telephone.  We see a corner of his head 
          and the phone.

                                    THIRD MAN
                               (at phone)
                        Stand by.  I'll tell you if we 
                        want to run it again.
                               (hangs up)

                                    THOMPSON'S VOICE
                        Well?

          A short pause.

                                    A MAN'S VOICE
                        It's a tough thing to do in a 
                        newsreel.  Seventy years of a man's 
                        life -

          Murmur of highly salaried assent at this.  Rawlston walks toward 
          camera and out of the picture.  Others are rising.  Camera 
          during all of this, apparently does its best to follow action 
          and pick up faces, but fails.  Actually, all set-ups are to be 
          planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality 
          from this scene; which is expressed entirely by voices, shadows, 
          sillhouettes and the big, bright image of Kane himself on the 
          screen.

                                    A VOICE
                        See what Arthur Ellis wrote about 
                        him in the American review?

                                    THIRD MAN
                        I read it.

                                    THE VOICE
                               (its owner is already 
                               leaning across the 
                               table, holding a 
                               piece of paper 
                               under the desk 
                               light and reading 
                               from it)
                        Listen:  Kane is dead.  He 
                        contributed to the journalism of 
                        his day - the talent of a 
                        mountebank, the morals of a 
                        bootlegger, and the manners of a 
                        pasha.  He and his kind have almost 
                        succeeded in transforming a once 
                        noble profession into a seven 
                        percent security - no longer secure.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        That's what Arthur Ellis is writing 
                        now.  Thirty years ago, when Kane 
                        gave him his chance to clean up 
                        Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis, 
                        Kane was the greatest guy in the
                        world.  If you ask me -

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        Charles Foster Kane was a...

          Then observations are made almost simultaneous.

                                    RAWLSTON'S VOICE
                        Just a minute!

          Camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow 
          from the projection room.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        What were Kane's last words?

          A silence greets this.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        What were the last words he said 
                        on earth?  Thompson, you've made 
                        us a good short, but it needs 
                        character -

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                        Motivation -

                                    RAWLSTON
                        That's it - motivation.  What made 
                        Kane what he was?  And, for that 
                        matter, what was he?  What we've 
                        just seen are the outlines of a 
                        career - what's behind the career?  
                        What's the man?  Was he good or 
                        bad?  Strong or foolish?  Tragic 
                        or silly?  Why did he do all those 
                        things?  What was he after?
                               (then, appreciating 
                               his point)
                        Maybe he told us on his death bed.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes, and maybe he didn't.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Ask the question anyway, Thompson!
                        Build the picture around the 
                        question, even if you can't answer 
                        it.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I know, but -

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (riding over him 
                               like any other 
                               producer)
                        All we saw on that screen was a 
                        big American -

                                    A VOICE
                        One of the biggest.

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (without pausing 
                               for this)
                        But how is he different from Ford?
                        Or Hearst for that matter?  Or 
                        Rockefeller - or John Doe?

                                    A VOICE
                        I know people worked for Kane will 
                        tell you - not only in the newspaper 
                        business - look how he raised 
                        salaries.  You don't want to forget -

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        You take his labor record alone, 
                        they ought to hang him up like a 
                        dog.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        I tell you, Thompson - a man's 
                        dying words -

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                        What were they?

          Silence.

                                    SOMEBODY'S VOICE
                               (hesitant)
                        Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's 
                        dying words?

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (with disgust)
                        Rosebud!

          A little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced 
          by Rawlston.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        That's right.

                                    A VOICE
                        Tough guy, huh?
                               (derisively)
                        Dies calling for Rosebud!

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Here's a man who might have been 
                        President.  He's been loved and 
                        hated and talked about as much as 
                        any man in our time - but when he 
                        comes to die, he's got something 
                        on his mind called "Rosebud."  
                        What does that mean?

                                    ANOTHER VOICE
                        A racehorse he bet on once, 
                        probably, that didn't come in - 
                        Rosebud!

                                    RAWLSTON
                        All right.  But what was the race?

          There is a short silence.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Thompson!

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes, sir.

                                    RAWLSTON
                        Hold this thing up for a week.  
                        Two weeks if you have to...

                                    THOMPSON
                               (feebly)
                        But don't you think if we release 
                        it now - he's only been dead four 
                        days it might be better than if -

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (decisively)
                        Nothing is ever better than finding 
                        out what makes people tick.  Go 
                        after the people that knew Kane 
                        well.  That manager of his - the 
                        little guy, Bernstein, those two 
                        wives, all the people who knew 
                        him, had worked for him, who loved 
                        him, who hated his guts -
                               (pauses)
                        I don't mean go through the City
                        Directory, of course -

          The Third Man gives a hearty "yes-man" laugh.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'll get to it right away, Mr.
                        Rawlston.

                                    RAWLSTON
                               (rising)
                        Good!

          The camera from behind him, outlines his back against Kane's 
          picture on the screen.

                                    RAWLSTON'S VOICE
                        It'll probably turn out to be a 
                        very simple thing...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          NOTE:  Now begins the story proper - the seach by Thompson for 
          the facts about Kane - his researches ... his interviews with 
          the people who knew Kane.

          It is important to remember always that only at the very end 
          of the story is Thompson himself a personality.  Until then, 
          throughout the picture, we photograph only Thompson's back, 
          shoulders, or his shadow - sometimes we only record his voice.  
          He is not until the final scene a "character".  He is the 
          personification of the search for the truth about Charles Foster 
          Kane.  He is the investigator.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. CHEAP CABARET - "EL RANCHO" - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT - 
          1940 (MINIATURE) - RAIN

          The first image to register is a sign:

          "EL RANCHO"

          FLOOR SHOW

          SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE

          TWICE NIGHTLY

          These words, spelled out in neon, glow out of the darkness at 
          the end of the fade out.  Then there is lightning which reveals 
          a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands.  Thunder again, 
          and faintly the sound of music from within.  A light glows 
          from a skylight.  The camera moves to this and closes in.  
          Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down 
          into the interior of the cabaret.  Directly below us at a table 
          sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCO" CABARET - NIGHT -

          Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink 
          she started to take above.  It is Susie.  The music, of course, 
          is now very loud.  Thompson, his back to the camera, moves 
          into the picture in the close foreground.  A Captain appears 
          behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (a Greek)
                        This is Mr. Thompson, Miss 
                        Alexander.

          Susan looks up into Thompson's face.  She is fifty, trying to 
          look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously 
          generous evening dress.  Blinking up into Thompson's face, she 
          throws a crink into ther mouth.  Her eyes, which she thinks is 
          keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery.

                                    SUSAN
                               (to the Captain)
                        I want another drink, John.

          Low thunder from outside.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (seeing his chance)
                        Right away.  Will you have 
                        something, Mr. Thompson?

                                    THOMPSON
                               (staring to sit 
                               down)
                        I'll have a highball.

                                    SUSAN
                               (so insistently as 
                               to make Thompson 
                               change his mind 
                               and stand up again)
                        Who told you you could sit down 
                        here?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Oh!  I thought maybe we could have 
                        a drink together?

                                    SUSAN
                        Think again!

          There is an awkward pause as Thompson looks from her to the 
          Captain.

                                    SUSAN
                        Why don't you people let me alone?
                        I'm minding my own business.  You 
                        mind yours.

                                    THOMPSON
                        If you'd just let me talk to you 
                        for a little while, Miss Alexander.
                        All I want to ask you...

                                    SUSAN
                        Get out of here!
                               (almost hysterical)
                        Get out!  Get out!

          Thompson looks at the Captain, who shrugs his shoulders.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm sorry.  Maybe some other time -

          If he thought he would get a response from Susan, who thinks 
          she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error.  He 
          nods and walks off, following the Captain out the door.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She's just not talking to anybody 
                        from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm not from a newspaper exactly, 
                        I -

          They have come upon a waiter standing in front of a booth.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (to the waiter)
                        Get her another highball.

                                    THE WAITER
                        Another double?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (after a moment, 
                               pityingly)
                        Yes.

          They walk to the door.

                                    THOMPSON
                        She's plastered, isn't she?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She'll snap out of it.  Why, until 
                        he died, she'd just as soon talk 
                        about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  
                        Sooner.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'll come down in a week or so and 
                        see her again.  Say, you might be 
                        able to help me.  When she used to 
                        talk about Kane - did she ever 
                        happen to say anything - about 
                        Rosebud?

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        Rosebud?

          Thompson has just handed him a bill.  The Captain pockets it.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        Thank you, sir.  As a matter of 
                        fact, yesterday afternoon, when it 
                        was in all the papers - I asked 
                        her.  She never heard of Rosebud.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -

          An excruciatingly noble interpretation of Mr. Thatcher himself 
          executed in expensive marble.  He is shown seated on one of 
          those improbable Edwin Booth chairs and is looking down, his 
          stone eyes fixed on the camera.

          We move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on 
          which the monument is founded.  The words, "Walter Parks 
          Thatcher" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon.  
          Immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium 
          shot, the person of Bertha Anderson, an elderly, manish 
          spinnster, seated behind her desk.  Thompson, his hat in his 
          hand, is standing before her.  Bertha is on the phone.

                                    BERTHA
                               (into phone)
                        Yes.  I'll take him in now.
                               (hangs up and looks 
                               at Thompson)
                        The directors of the Thatcher 
                        Library have asked me to remind 
                        you again of the condition under 
                        which you may inspect certain 
                        portions of Mr. Thatcher's 
                        unpublished memoirs.  Under no 
                        circumstances are direct quotations 
                        from his manuscript to be used by 
                        you.

                                    THOMPSON
                        That's all right.

                                    BERTHA
                        You may come with me.

          Without watching whether he is following her or not, she rises 
          and starts towards a distant and imposingly framed door.  
          Thompson, with a bit of a sigh, follows.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -

          A room with all the warmth and charm of Napolean's tomb.

          As we dissolve in, the door opens in and we see past Thompson's 
          shoulders the length of the room.  Everything very plain, very 
          much made out of marble and very gloomy.  Illumination from a 
          skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and 
          classical despair.  The floor is marble, and there is a 
          gigantic, mahogany table in the center of everything.  Beyond 
          this is to be seen, sunk in the marble wall at the far end of 
          the room, the safe from which a guard, in a khaki uniform, 
          with a revolver holster at his hip, is extracting the journal 
          of Walter P. Thatcher.  He brings it to Bertha as if he were 
          the guardian of a bullion shipment.  During this, Bertha has 
          been speaking.

                                    BERTHA
                               (to the guard)
                        Pages eighty-three to one hundred 
                        and forty-two, Jennings.

                                    GUARD
                        Yes, Miss Anderson.

                                    BERTHA
                               (to Thompson)
                        You will confine yourself, it is 
                        our understanding, to the chapter 
                        dealing with Mr. Kane.

                                    THOMPSON
                        That's all I'm interested in.

          The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal.  
          Bertha places it reverently on the table before Thompson.

                                    BERTHA
                        You will be required to leave this 
                        room at four-thirty promptly.

          She leaves.  Thompson starts to light a cigarette.  The guard 
          shakes his head.  With a sigh, Thompson bends over to read the 
          manuscript.  Camera moves down over his shoulder onto page of 
          manuscript.

          Manuscript, neatly and precisely written:

          "CHARLES FOSTER KANE

          WHEN THESE LINES APPEAR IN PRINT, FIFTY YEARS AFTER MY DEATH, 
          I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL AGREE WITH MY OPINION 
          OF CHARLES FOSTER KANE, ASSUMING THAT HE IS NOT THEN COMPLETELY 
          FORGOTTEN, WHICH I REGARD AS EXTREMELY LIKELY.  A GOOD DEAL OF 
          NONSENSE HAS APPEARED ABOUT MY FIRST MEETING WITH KANE, WHEN 
          HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD...  THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE.  IN THE WINTER 
          OF 1870..."

          The camera has not held on the entire page.  It has been 
          following the words with the same action that the eye does the 
          reading.  On the last words, the white page of the paper

                                                            DISSOLVES INTO:

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          The white of a great field of snow, seen from the angle of a 
          parlor window.

          In the same position of the last word in above Insert, appears 
          the tiny figure of Charles Foster Kane, aged five (almost like 
          an animated cartoon).  He is in the act of throwing a snowball 
          at the camera.  It sails toward us and over our heads, out of 
          scene.

          Reverse angle - on the house featuring a large sign reading:

          MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE

          HIGH CLASS MEALS AND LODGING

          INQUIRE WITHIN

          Charles Kane's snowball hits the sign.

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Camera is angling through the window, but the window-frame is 
          not cut into scene.  We see only the field of snow again, same 
          angle as in previous scene.  Charles is manufacturing another 
          snowball.  Now -

          Camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we 
          are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse.  Mrs. Kane, aged 
          about 28, is looking out towards her son.  Just as we take her 
          in she speaks:

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (calling out)
                        Be careful, Charles!

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        Mrs. Kane -

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (Calling out the 
                               window almost on 
                               top of this)
                        Pull your muffler around your neck, 
                        Charles -

          But Charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to 
          this and is running away.  Mrs. Kane turns into camera and we 
          see her face - a strong face, worn and kind.

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        think we'll have to tell him now -

          Camera now pulls back further, showing Thatcher standing before 
          a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing 
          multiplicity of official-looking documents.  He is 26 and, as 
          might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very 
          expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        I'll sign those papers -

                                    KANE SR.
                        You people seem to forget that I'm 
                        the boy's father.

          At the sound of Kane Sr.'s voice, both have turned to him and 
          the camera pulls back still further, taking him in.

          Kane Sr., who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has 
          been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever 
          since daybreak.

          From outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and 
          cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It's going to be done exactly the
                        way I've told Mr. Thatcher -

                                    KANE SR.
                        If I want to, I can go to court.
                        father has a right to -

                                    THATCHER
                               (annoyed)
                        Mr. Kane, the certificates that 
                        Mr.  Graves left here are made out 
                        to Mrs.  Kane, in her name.  Hers 
                        to do with as she pleases -

                                    KANE SR.
                        Well, I don't hold with signing my 
                        boy away to any bank as guardian
                        just because -

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (quietly)
                        I want you to stop all this 
                        nonsense, Jim.

                                    THATCHER
                        The Bank's decision in all matters 
                        concerning his education, his place 
                        of residence and similar subjects 
                        will be final.
                               (clears his throat)

                                    KANE SR.
                        The idea of a bank being the 
                        guardian -

          Mrs. Kane has met his eye.  Her triumph over him finds 
          expression in his failure to finish his sentence.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (even more quietly)
                        I want you to stop all this 
                        nonsense, Jim.

                                    THATCHER
                        We will assume full management of 
                        the Colorado Lode - of which you, 
                        Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.

          Kane Sr. opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, 
          but chokes down his opinion.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (has been reading 
                               past Thatcher's 
                               shoulder as he 
                               talked)
                        Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                        Right here, Mrs. Kane.

                                    KANE SR.
                               (sulkily)
                        Don't say I didn't warn you.

          Mrs. Kane lifts the quill pen.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Mary, I'm asking you for the last 
                        time - anyon'd think I hadn't been
                        a good husband and a -

          Mrs. Kane looks at him slowly.  He stops his speech.

                                    THATCHER
                        The sum of fifty thousand dollars 
                        a year is to be paid to yourself 
                        and Mr. Kane as long as you both 
                        live, and thereafter the survivor -

          Mrs. Kane puts pen to the paper and signs.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Well, let's hope it's all for the 
                        best.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -

          Mrs. Kane, listening to Thatcher, of course has had her other 
          ear bent in the direction of the boy's voice.  Thatcher is 
          aware both of the boy's voice, which is counter to his own, 
          and of Mrs. Kane's divided attention.  As he pauses, Kane Sr. 
          genteelly walks over to close the window.

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Jr., seen from Kane Sr.'s position at the window.  He is 
          advancing on the snowman, snowballs in his hands, dropping to 
          one knee the better to confound his adversary.

                                    KANE
                        If the rebels want a fight boys, 
                        let's give it to 'em!

          He throws two snowballs, missing widely, and gets up and 
          advances another five feet before getting on his knees again.

                                    KANE
                        The terms are underconditional 
                        surrender.  Up and at 'em!  The 
                        Union forever!

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Sr. closes the window.

                                    THATCHER
                               (over the boy's 
                               voice)
                        Everything else - the principal as 
                        well as all monies earned - is to 
                        be administered by the bank in 
                        trust for your son, Charles Foster 
                        Kane, until his twenty-fifth 
                        birthday, at which time he is to 
                        come into complete possession.

          Mrs. Kane rises and goes to the window.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

          Thatcher continues as she opens the window.  His voice, as 
          before, is heard with overtones of the boy's.

          EXT. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane Jr., seen from Mrs. Kane's position at the window.  He is 
          now within ten feet of the snowman, with one snowball left 
          which he is holding back in his right hand.

                                    KANE
                        You can't lick Andy Jackson!  Old 
                        Hickory, that's me!

          He fires his snowball, well wide of the mark and falls flat on 
          his stomach, starting to crawl carefully toward the snowman.

                                    THATCHER'S VOICE
                        It's nearly five, Mrs. Kane, don't
                        you think I'd better meet the boy -

          INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Mrs. Kane at the window.  Thatcher is now standing at her side.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        I've got his trunk all packed -
                               (she chokes a little)
                        I've it packed for a couple of 
                        weeks -

          She can't say anymore.  She starts for the hall day.  Kane 
          Sr., ill at ease, has no idea of how to comfort her.

                                    THATCHER
                        I've arranged for a tutor to meet 
                        us in Chicago.  I'd have brought 
                        him along with me, but you were so
                        anxious to keep everything secret -

          He stops as he realizes that Mrs. Kane has paid no attention 
          to him and, having opened the door, is already well into the 
          hall that leads to the side door of the house.  He takes a 
          look at Kane Sr., tightens his lips and follows Mrs. Kane.  
          Kane, shoulders thrown back like one who bears defeat bravely, 
          follows him.

          EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

          Kane, in the snow-covered field.  With the snowman between him 
          and the house, he is holding the sled in his hand, just about 
          to make the little run that prefaces a belly-flop.  The Kane 
          house, in the background, is a dilapidated, shabby, two-story 
          frame building, with a wooden outhouse.  Kane looks up as he 
          sees the single file procession, Mrs. Kane at its head, coming 
          toward him.

                                    KANE
                        H'ya, Mom.

          Mrs. Kane smiles.

                                    KANE
                               (gesturing at the 
                               snowman)
                        See, Mom?  I took the pipe out of 
                        his mouth.  If it keeps on snowin',
                        maybe I'll make some teeth and -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        You better come inside, son.  You 
                        and I have got to get you all ready
                        for - for -

                                    THATCHER
                        Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

                                    THATCHER
                        How do you do, Charles?

                                    KANE SR.
                        He comes from the east.

                                    KANE
                        Hello.  Hello, Pop.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Hello, Charlie!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Mr. Thatcher is going to take you 
                        on a trip with him tonight, Charles.
                        You'll be leaving on Number Ten.

                                    KANE SR.
                        That's the train with all the 
                        lights.

                                    KANE
                        You goin', Mom?

                                    THATCHER
                        Your mother won't be going right 
                        away, Charles -

                                    KANE
                        Where'm I going?

                                    KANE SR.
                        You're going to see Chicago and 
                        New York - and Washington, maybe...
                        Isn't he, Mr. Thatcher?

                                    THATCHER
                               (heartily)
                        He certainly is.  I wish I were a 
                        little boy and going to make a 
                        trip like that for the first time.

                                    KANE
                        Why aren't you comin' with us, 
                        Mom?

                                    MRS. KANE
                        We have to stay here, Charles.

                                    KANE SR.
                        You're going to live with Mr. 
                        Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  
                        You're going to be rich.  Your Ma 
                        figures - that is, re - she and I 
                        have decided that this isn't the 
                        place for you to grow up in.
                        You'll probably be the richest man 
                        in America someday and you ought 
                        to -

                                    MRS. KANE
                        You won't be lonely, Charles...

                                    THATCHER
                        We're going to have a lot of good 
                        times together, Charles...  Really 
                        we are.

          Kane stares at him.

                                    THATCHER
                        Come on, Charles.  Let's shake 
                        hands.
                               (extends his hand.  
                               Charles continues 
                               to look at him)
                        Now, now!  I'm not as frightening 
                        as all that!  Let's shake, what do 
                        you say?

          He reaches out for Charles's hand.  Without a word, Charles 
          hits him in the stomach with the sled.  Thatcher stumbles back 
          a few feet, gasping.

                                    THATCHER
                               (with a sickly grin)
                        You almost hurt me, Charles.
                               (moves towards him)
                        Sleds aren't to hit people with.
                        Sleds are to - to sleigh on.  When 
                        we get to New York, Charles, we'll
                        get you a sled that will -

          He's near enough to try to put a hand on Kane's shoulder.  As 
          he does, Kane kicks him in the ankle.

                                    MRS. KANE
                        Charles!

          He throws himself on her, his arms around her.  Slowly Mrs. 
          Kane puts her arms around him.

                                    KANE
                               (frightened)
                        Mom!  Mom!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        It's all right, Charles, it's all 
                        right.

          Thatcher is looking on indignantly, occasionally bending over 
          to rub his ankle.

                                    KANE SR.
                        Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid 
                        needs is a good thrashing!

                                    MRS. KANE
                        That's what you think, is it, Jim?

                                    KANE SR.
                        Yes.

          Mrs. Kane looks slowly at Mr. Kane.

                                    MRS. KANE
                               (slowly)
                        That's why he's going to be brought 
                        up where you can't get at him.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Old-fashioned railroad wheels underneath a sleeper, spinning 
          along the track.

          INT. TRAIN - OLD-FASHIONED DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT -

          Thatcher, with a look of mingled exasperation, annoyance, 
          sympathy and inability to handle the situation, is standing 
          alongside a berth, looking at Kane.  Kane, his face in the 
          pillow, is crying with heartbreaking sobs.

                                    KANE
                        Mom!  Mom!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          The white page of the Thatcher manuscript.  We pick up the 
          words:

          "HE WAS, I REPEAT, A COMMON ADVENTURER, SPOILED, UNSCRUPULOUS, 
          IRRESPONSIBLE."

          The words are followed by printed headline on "Enquirer" copy 
          (as in following scene).

          INT. ENQUIRER CITY ROOM - DAY -

          Close-up on printed headline which reads:

          "ENEMY ARMADA OFF JERSEY COAST"

          Camera pulls back to reveal Thatcher holding the "Enquirer" 
          copy, on which we read the headline.  He is standing near the 
          editorial round table around which a section of the staff, 
          including Reilly, Leland and Kane are eating lunch.

                                    THATCHER
                               (coldly)
                        Is that really your idea of how to 
                        run a newspaper?

                                    KANE
                        I don't know how to run a newspaper, 
                        Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything 
                        I can think of.

                                    THATCHER
                               (reading headline 
                               of paper he is 
                               still holding)
                        "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  
                        You know you haven't the slightest 
                        proof that this - this armada - is 
                        off the Jersey Coast.

                                    KANE
                        Can you prove it isn't?

          Bernstein has come into the picture.  He has a cable in his 
          hand.  He stops when he sees Thatcher.

                                    KANE

                        That's all right.  We have no 
                        secrets from our readers.  Mr. 
                        Thatcher is one of our most devoted 
                        readers, Mr.  Bernstein.  He knows 
                        what's wrong with every issue since 
                        I've taken charge.  What's the

                        trees and sunrises and tropical 
                        colors blending in far off 
                        landscapes but don't feel right in

                                    THATCHER
                        You see!  There hasn't been a true 
                        word -

                                    KANE
                        I think we'll have to send our 
                        friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. 
                        Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have 
                        to make it shorter than his, because 
                        he's working on an expense account 
                        and we're not.  Let me see -
                               (snaps his fingers)
                        Mike!

                                    MIKE
                               (a fairly tough 
                               customer prepares 
                               to take dictation, 
                               his mouth still 
                               full of food)
                        Go ahead, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Dear Wheeler -
                               (pauses a moment)
                        You provide the prose poems - I'll 
                        provide the war.

          Laughter from the boys and girls at the table.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        That's fine, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        I rather like it myself.  Send it 
                        right away.

                                    MIKE
                        Right away.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Right away.

          Mike and Bernstein leave.  Kane looks up, grinning at Thatcher, 
          who is bursting with indignation but controls himself.  After 
          a moment of indecision, he decides to make one last try.

                                    THATCHER
                        I came to see you, Charles, about 
                        your - about the Enquirer's campaign 
                        against the Metropolitan Transfer 
                        Company.

                                    KANE
                        Won't you step into my office, Mr.
                        Thatcher?

          They cross the City Room together.

                                    THATCHER
                        I think I should remind you, 
                        Charles, of a fact you seem to 
                        have forgotten.  You are yourself 
                        one of the largest individual 
                        stockholders.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Kane holds the door open for Thatcher.  They come in together.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything 
                        I've been saying in the Enquirer 
                        about the traction trust absolutely 
                        true?

                                    THATCHER
                               (angrily)
                        They're all part of your general
                        attack - your senseless attack -
                        on everything and everybody who's 
                        got more than ten cents in his 
                        pocket.  They're -

                                    KANE
                        The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you 
                        don't realize you're talking to
                        two people.

          Kane moves around behind his desk.  Thatcher doesn't understand, 
          looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        As Charles Foster Kane, who has                         
                        eighty-two thousand, six hundred 
                        and thirty-one shares of 
                        Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I 
                        do have a rough idea of my holdings -
                        I sympathize with you.  Charles 
                        Foster Kane is a dangerous 
                        scoundrel, his paper should be run 
                        out of town and a committee should 
                        be formed to boycott him.  You 
                        may, if you can form such a 
                        committee, put me down for a 
                        contribution of one thousand 
                        dollars.

                                    THATCHER
                               (angrily)
                        Charles, my time is too valuable 
                        for me -

                                    KANE
                        On the other hand -
                               (his manner becomes 
                               serious)
                        I am the publisher of the Enquirer.
                        As such, it is my duty - I'll let 
                        you in on a little secret, it is 
                        also my pleasure - to see to it 
                        that decent, hard-working people 
                        of this city are not robbed blind 
                        by a group of money - mad pirates 
                        because, God help them, they have 
                        no one to look after their 
                        interests!  I'll let you in on 
                        another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  
                        I think I'm the man to do it.  You 
                        see, I have money and property -

          Thatcher doesn't understand him.

                                    KANE
                        If I don't defend the interests of 
                        the underprivileged, somebody else 
                        will - maybe somebody without any 
                        money or any property and that 
                        would be too bad.

          Thatcher glares at him, unable to answer.  Kane starts to dance.

                                    KANE
                        Do you know how to tap, Mr. 
                        Thatcher?  You ought to learn -
                               (humming quietly, 
                               he continues to 
                               dance)

          Thatcher puts on his hat.

                                    THATCHER
                        I happened to see your consolidated 
                        statement yesterday, Charles.  
                        Could I not suggest to you that it 
                        is unwise for you to continue this 
                        philanthropic enterprise -
                               (sneeringly)
                        this Enquirer - that is costing 
                        you one million dollars a year?

                                    KANE
                        You're right.  We did lose a million 
                        dollars last year.

          Thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered.

                                    KANE
                        We expect to lost a million next
                        year, too.  You know, Mr. Thatcher -
                               (starts tapping 
                               quietly)
                        at the rate of a million a year -
                        we'll have to close this place in 
                        sixty years.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY

          Thompson - at the desk.  With a gesture of annoyance, he is 
          closing the manuscript.

          Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on 
          door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to 
          confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him 
          out.  Very prominent on this wall is an over-sized oil painting 
          of Thatcher in the best Union League Club renaissance style.

                                    MISS ANDERSON
                        You have enjoyed a very rare 
                        privilege, young man.  Did you 
                        find what you were looking for?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No.  Tell me something, Miss 
                        Anderson.  You're not Rosebud, are 
                        you?

                                    MISS ANDERSON
                        What?

                                    THOMPSON
                        I didn't think you were.  Well, 
                        thanks for the use of the hall.

          He puts his hat on his head and starts out, lighting a cigarette 
          as he goes.  Miss Anderson, scandalized, watches him.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER SKYSCRAPER - DAY -

          Closeup of a still of Kane, aged about sixty-five.  Camera 
          pulls back, showing it is a framed photograph on the wall.  
          Over the picture are crossed American flags.  Under it sits 
          Bernstein, back of his desk.  Bernstein, always an undersized 
          Jew, now seems even smaller than in his youth.  He is bald as 
          an egg, spry, with remarkably intense eyes.  As camera continues 
          to travel back, the back of Thompson's head and his shoulders 
          come into the picture.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (wryly)
                        Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman 
                        of the Board.  I got nothing but 
                        time ...  What do you want to know?

                                    THOMPSON
                               (still explaining)
                        Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with 
                        Mr.  Kane from the very beginning -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        From before the beginning, young 
                        fellow.  And now it's after the 
                        end.
                               (turns to Thompson)
                        Anything you want to know about 
                        him - about the paper -

                                    THOMPSON
                        -  We thought maybe, if we can 
                        find out what he meant by that 
                        last word - as he was dying -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  
                        There were a lot of them back in 
                        the early days, and -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Not some girl he knew casually and 
                        then remembered after fifty years,
                        on his death bed -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You're pretty young, Mr. -
                               (remembers the name)
                        Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will 
                        remember things you wouldn't think 
                        he'd remember.  You take me.  One 
                        day, back in 1896, I was crossing 
                        over to Jersey on a ferry and as 
                        we pulled out, there was another
                        ferry pulling in -
                               (slowly)
                        - and on it, there was a girl 
                        waiting to get off.  A white dress 
                        she had on - and she was carrying 
                        a white pastrol - and I only saw 
                        her for one second and she didn't 
                        see me at all - but I'll bet a 
                        month hasn't gone by since that I 
                        haven't thought of that girl.
                               (triumphantly)
                        See what I mean?
                               (smiles)
                        Well, so what are you doing about 
                        this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm calling on people who knew Mr. 
                        Kane.  I'm calling on you.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who else you been to see?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well, I went down to Atlantic City -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Susie?  I called her myself the 
                        day after he died.  I thought maybe 
                        somebody ought to...
                               (sadly)
                        She couldn't even come to the 
                        'phone.

                                    THOMPSON
                        You know why?  She was so -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sure, sure.

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'm going back there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who else did you see?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Nobody else, but I've been through 
                        that stuff of Walter Thatcher's.
                        That journal of his -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Thatcher!  That man was the biggest
                        darn fool I ever met -

                                    THOMPSON
                        He made an awful lot of money.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        It's not trick to make an awful 
                        lot of money if all you want is to 
                        make a lot of money.
                               (his eyes get 
                               reflective)
                        Thatcher!

          Bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming 
          to see something as he talks.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He never knew there was anything 
                        in the world but money.  That kind 
                        of fellow you can fool every day 
                        in the week - and twice on Sundays!
                               (reflectively)
                        The time he came to Rome for Mr. 
                        Kane's twenty-fifth birthday...  
                        You know, when Mr. Kane got control 
                        of his own
                        money...  Such a fool like Thatcher -
                        I tell you, nobody's business!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Bernstein speaking to Thompson.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane 
                        did, and he got it!  Thatcher never 
                        did figure him out.  He was hard 
                        to figure sometimes, even for me.  
                        Mr. Kane was a genius like he said.  
                        He had that funny sense of humor.  
                        Sometimes even I didn't get the 
                        joke.  Like that night the opera 
                        house of his opened in Chicago...  
                        You know, the opera house he built 
                        for Susie, she should be an opera 
                        singer...
                               (indicates with a 
                               little wave of his 
                               hand what he thinks 
                               of that; sighing)
                        That was years later, of course - 
                        1914 it was.  Mrs. Kane took the 
                        leading part in the opera, and she 
                        was terrible.  But nobody had the 
                        nerve to say so - not even the 
                        critics.  Mr. Kane was a big man 
                        in those days.  But this one fellow, 
                        this friend of his, Branford Leland -

          He leaves the sentence up in the air, as we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          It is late.  The room is almost empty.  Nobody is at work at 
          the desks.  Bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little 
          group of Kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with 
          overcoats and hats.  Eveybody is tense and expectant.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                               (turns to a young 
                               hireling; quietly)
                        What about Branford Leland?  Has 
                        he got in his copy?

                                    HIRELING
                        Not yet.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Go in and ask him to hurry.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein?
                        You know Mr. Leland.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him for a 
                               moment; then slowly)
                        I might make him nervous.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                               (after a pause)
                        You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you 
                        were great friends back in the old 
                        days, I understand.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (with a smile)
                        That's right.  They called us the 
                        "Three Musketeers."

          Somebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter.  
          The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        He's a great guy - Leland.
                               (another little 
                               pause)
                        Why'd he ever leave New York?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (he isn't saying)
                        That's a long story.

                                    ANOTHER HIRELING
                               (a tactless one)
                        Wasn't there some sort of quarrel 
                        between -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (quickly)
                        I had nothing to do with it.
                               (then, somberly)
                        It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and 
                        you couldn't call it a quarrel 
                        exactly.  Better we should forget 
                        such things -
                               (turning to City 
                               Editor)
                        Leland is writing it up from the 
                        dramatic angle?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes.  I thought it was a good idea.
                        We've covered it from the news 
                        end, of course.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        And the social.  How about the 
                        music notice?  You got that in?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Oh, yes, it's already made up.  
                        Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Enthusiastic?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, very!
                               (quietly)
                        Naturally.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, well - isn't that nice?

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Mr. Bernstein -

          Bernstein turns.

          Medium long shot of Kane, now forty-nine, already quite stout.  
          He is in white tie, wearing his overcoat and carrying a folded 
          opera hat.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hello, Mr. Kane.

          The Hirelings rush, with Bernstein, to Kane's side.  Widespread, 
          half-suppressed sensation.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!

                                    KANE
                        We've got a nice plant here.

          Everybody falls silent.  There isn't anything to say.

                                    KANE
                        Was the show covered by every 
                        department?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Exactly according to your 
                        instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got 
                        two spreads of pictures.

                                    KANE
                               (very, very casually)
                        And the notice?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes - Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        Is it good?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, Mr. kane.

          Kane looks at him for a minute.

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        But there's another one still to 
                        come - the dramatic notice.

                                    KANE
                               (sharply)
                        It isn't finished?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        No, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        That's Leland, isn't it?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        Yes, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Has he said when he'll finish?

                                    CITY EDITOR
                        We haven't heard from him.

                                    KANE
                        He used to work fast - didn't he, 
                        Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He sure did, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Where is he?

                                    ANOTHER HIRELING
                        Right in there, Mr. Kane.

          The Hireling indicates the closed glass door of a little office 
          at the other end of the City Room.  Kane takes it in.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (helpless, but very 
                               concerned)
                        MR. KANE -

                                    KANE
                        That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.

          Kane crosses the length of the long City Room to the glass 
          door indicated before by the Hireling.  The City Editor looks 
          at Bernstein.  Kane opens the door and goes into the office, 
          closing the door behind him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't 
                        spoke together for ten years.
                               (long pause; finally)
                        Excuse me.
                               (starts toward the 
                               door)

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Bernstein comes in.  An empty bottle is standing on Leland's 
          desk.  He has fallen over his typewriter, his face on the keys.  
          A sheet of paper is in the machine.  A paragraph has been typed.  
          Kane is standing at the other side of the desk looking down on 
          him.  This is the first time we see murder in Kane's face.  
          Bernstein looks at Kane, then crosses to Leland.  He shakes 
          him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hey, Brad!  Brad!
                               (he straightens, 
                               looks at Kane; 
                               pause)
                        He ain't been drinking before, Mr. 
                        Kane.  Never.  We would have heard.

                                    KANE
                               (finally; after a 
                               pause)
                        What does it say there?

          Bernstein stares at him.

                                    KANE
                        What's he written?

          Bernstein looks over nearsightedly, painfully reading the 
          paragraph written on the page.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (reading)
                        "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty 
                        but hopelessly incompetent amateur -
                               (he waits for a 
                               minute to catch 
                               his breath; he 
                               doesn't like it)

                               (looks up miserably)
                        I can't pronounce that name, Mr. 
                        Kane.

                        Thais.

          Bernstein looks at Kane for a moment, then looks back, tortured.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (reading again)
                        "Her singing, happily, is no concern 
                        of this department.  Of her acting,

                               (he continues to 
                               stare at the page)

                                    KANE
                               (after a short 
                               silence)
                        Go on!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (without looking up)
                        That's all there is.

          Kane snatches the paper from the roller and reads it for 
          himself.  Slowly, a queer look comes over his face.  Then he 
          speaks, very quietly.

                                    KANE
                        Of her acting, it is absolutely 
                        impossible to say anything except 
                        that it represents a new low...
                               (then sharply)
                        Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein?
                        In the opinion of this reviewer -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (miserably)
                        I didn't see that.

                                    KANE
                        It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm 
                        dictating it.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him)
                        I can't take shorthand.

                                    KANE
                        Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish 
                        the notice.

          Bernstein retreats from the room.

          Bernstein speaking to Thompson.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He finished it.  He wrote the worst 
                        notice I ever read about the girl 
                        he loved.  We ran it in every paper.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (after a pause)
                        I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so 
                        well of Susie's art anyway.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looks at him very 
                               soberly)
                        He thought she was great, Mr. 
                        Thompson.  He really believed that.  
                        He put all his ambition on that 
                        girl.  After she came along, he 
                        never really cared for himself 
                        like he used to.  Oh, I don't
                        blame Susie -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well, then, how could he write 
                        that roast?  The notices in the 
                        Kane papers were always very kind 
                        to her.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell 
                        you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard 
                        man to figure out.  He had that 
                        funny sense of humor.  And then, 
                        too, maybe he thought by finishing 
                        that piece he could show Leland he 
                        was an honest man.  You see, Leland 
                        didn't think so.  I guess he showed 
                        him all right.  He's a nice fellow, 
                        but he's a dreamer.  They were 
                        always together in those early 
                        days when we just started the 
                        Enquirer.

          On these last words, we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          The front half of the second floor constitutes one large City 
          Room.  Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of 
          it is actually getting into the room because the windows are 
          small and narrow.  There are about a dozen tables and desks, 
          of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters.  
          Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, 
          obviously serve the city room executives.  To the left of the 
          platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum.

          As Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on 
          the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight 
          occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new 
          arrivals.  Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises 
          and starts toward them.

                                    CARTER
                        Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the 
                        "Enquirer."  I am Herbert Carter.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr.
                        Leland.

                                    CARTER
                               (bowing)
                        How do you do, Mr. Leland?

                                    KANE
                               (pointing to the 
                               standing reporters)
                        Are they standing for me?

                                    CARTER
                        I thought it would be a nice gesture
                        the new publisher -

                                    KANE
                               (grinning)
                        Ask them to sit down.

                                    CARTER
                        You may resume your work, gentlemen.
                               (to Kane)
                        I didn't know your plans and so I 
                        was unable to make any preparations.

                                    KANE
                        I don't my plans myself.

          They are following Carter to his raised platform.

                                    KANE
                        As a matter of fact, I haven't got 
                        any.  Except to get out a newspaper.

          There is a terrific crash at the doorway.  They all turn to 
          see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance.  A roll of bedding, a 
          suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

          Bernstein looks up.

                                    KANE
                        If you would come here a moment,
                        please, Mr. Bernstein?

          Bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes.

                                    KANE
                        Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.
                        Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.

                                    CARTER
                               (frigidly)
                        How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    KANE
                        You've got a private office here, 
                        haven't you?

          The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance 
          with parts of the bedstead and other furniture.  He is looking 
          about, a bit bewildered.

                                    CARTER

                        must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - LATE DAY -

          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll-top desk in the Sanctum, 
          is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal 
          at the same time.  Carter, still formally coated, is seated 
          alongside him.  Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, 
          detached, amused.  The furniture has been pushed around and 
          Kane's effects are somewhat in place.  On a corner of the desk, 
          Bernstein is writing down figures.  No one pays any attention 
          to him.

                                    KANE
                        I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, 
                        but here's what I mean.  There's a 
                        front page story in the "Chronicle,"
                               (points to it)
                        and a picture - of a woman in 
                        Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably 
                        murdered.
                               (looks to make sure 
                               of the name)
                        A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why 
                        didn't the "Enquirer" have that 
                        this morning?

                                    CARTER
                               (stiffly)
                        Because we're running a newspaper, 
                        Mr.  Kane, not a scandal sheet.

          Kane has finished eating.  He pushes away his plates.

                                    KANE
                        I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go 
                        to Rector's and get something 
                        decent.
                               (pointing to the 
                               "Chronicle" before 
                               him)
                        The "Chronicle" has a two-column 
                        headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't 
                        we?

                                    CARTER
                        There is no news big enough.

                        If the headline is big enough, it 
                        makes the new big enough.  The

                        to the Silverstone home yesterday 
                        afternoon.
                               (triumphantly)
                        Our man even arrived before the 
                        "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's 
                        no proof that the woman was murdered -
                        or even that she's dead.

                                    KANE
                               (smiling a bit)
                        The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's 
                        murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the 
                        neighbors are getting suspicious.

                                    CARTER
                               (stiffly)
                        It's not our function to report 
                        the gossip of housewives.  If we 
                        were interested in that kind of 
                        thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the 
                        paper twice over daily -

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        That's the kind of thing we are 
                        going to be interested in from now 
                        on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish 
                        you'd send your best man up to see 
                        Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell 
                        Mr.  Silverstone if he doesn't 
                        produce his wife at once, the 
                        "Enquirer" will have him arrested.
                               (he gets an idea)
                        Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's 
                        a detective from the Central Office.
                        If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his 
                        badge, your man is to get indignant 
                        and call Mr. Silverstone an 
                        anarchist.

          Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.

                                    CARTER
                        Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the
                        function of a respectable newspaper -

          Kane isn't listening to him.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!

          Bernstein looks up from his figures.

                                    KANE
                        I've just made a shocking discovery.
                        The "Enquirer" is without a 
                        telephone.  Have two installed at 
                        once!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        I ordered six already this morning!
                        Got a discount!

          Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at Bernstein.  
          Leland grins back.  Mr. Carter, meantime, has risen stiffly.

                                    CARTER
                        But, Mr. Kane -

                                    KANE
                        That'll be all today, Mr. Carter.
                        You've been most understanding.
                        Good day, Mr. Carter!

          Carter, with a look that runs just short of apoplexy, leaves 
          the room, closing the door behind him.

                                    LELAND
                        Poor Mr. Carter!

                                    KANE
                               (shakes his head)
                        What makes those fellows think 
                        that a newspaper is something rigid, 
                        something inflexible, that people
                        are supposed to pay two cents for -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (without looking up)
                        Three cents.

                                    KANE
                               (calmly)
                        Two cents.

          Bernstein lifts his head and looks at Kane.  Kane gazes back 
          at him.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (tapping on the 
                               paper)
                        This is all figured at three cents 
                        a copy.

                                    KANE
                        Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at 
                        two cents.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (sighs and puts 
                               papers in his pocket)
                        All right, but I'll keep these 
                        figures, too, just in case.

                                    KANE
                        Ready for dinner, Brad?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should 
                        decide to drop the price to one 
                        cent, or maybe even he should make 
                        up his mind to give the paper away 
                        with a half-pound of tea - you'll 
                        just hold him until I get back, 
                        won't you?

                                    LELAND
                        I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr.
                        Bernstein.  You people work too 
                        fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Who said anything about brooms?

                                    KANE
                        It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A 
                        new broom sweeps clean.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Oh!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT.PRIMITIVE COMPOSING AND PRESSROOM - NEW YORK ENQUIRER - 
          NIGHT -

          The ground floor witht he windows on the street - of the 
          "Enquirer."  It is almost midnight by an old-fashioned clock 
          on the wall.  Grouped around a large table, on which are several 
          locked forms of type, very old-fashioned of course, but true 
          to the period - are Kane and Leland in elegant evening clothes, 
          Bernstein, unchanged from the afternoon, and Smathers, the 
          composing room foreman, nervous and harassed.

                                    SMATHERS
                        But it's impossible, Mr. Kane.  We 
                        can't remake these pages.

                                    KANE
                        These pages aren't made up as I 
                        want them, Mr. Smathers.  We go to 
                        press in five minutes.

                                    CARTER
                               (about to crack up)
                        The "Enquirer" has an old and 
                        honored tradition, Mr. Kane...  
                        The "Enquirer" is not in competition 
                        with those other rags.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        We should be publishing such rags,
                        that's all I wish.  Why, the 
                        "Enquirer" - I wouldn't wrap up 
                        the liver for the cat in the 
                        "Enquirer" -

                                    CARTER
                               (enraged)
                        Mr. Kane, I must ask you to see to 
                        it that this - this person learns 
                        to control his tongue.

          Kane looks up.

                                    CARTER
                        I've been a newspaperman my whole 
                        life and I don't intend -
                               (he starts to sputter)
                        - if it's your intention that I 
                        should continue to be harassed by 
                        this - this -
                               (he's really sore)
                        I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go 
                        against my grain to desert you 
                        when you need me so badly - but I 
                        would feel obliged to ask that my 
                        resignation be accepted.

                                    KANE
                        It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with 
                        assurances of my deepest regard.

                                    CARTER
                        But Mr. Kane, I meant -

          Kane turns his back on him, speaks again to the composing room 
          foreman.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        Let's remake these pages, Mr. 
                        Smathers.  We'll have to publish a 
                        half hour late, that's all.

                                    SMATHERS
                               (as though Kane 
                               were talking Greek)
                        We can't remake them, Mr. Kane.  
                        We go to press in five minutes.

          Kane sighs, unperturbed, as he reaches out his hand and shoves 
          the forms off the table onto the floor, where they scatter 
          into hundreds of bits.

                                    KANE
                        You can remake them now, can't 
                        you, Mr. Smathers?

          Smather's mouth opens wider and wider.  Bradford and Bernstein 
          are grinning.

                                    KANE
                        After the types 've been reset and 
                        the pages have been remade according 
                        to the way I told you before, Mr.
                        Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled 
                        and bring them to me.  Then, if I 
                        can't find any way to improve them
                        again -
                               (almost as if 
                               reluctantly)
                        - I suppose we'll have to go to 
                        press.

          He starts out of the room, followed by Leland.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (to Smathers)
                        In case you don't understand, Mr.
                        Smathers - he's a new broom.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The picture is mainly occupied by a large building, on the 
          roof of which the lights spell out the word "Enquirer" against 
          the sunrise.  We do not see the street or the first few stories 
          of this building, the windows of which would be certainly 
          illuminated.  What we do see is the floor on which is located 
          the City Room.  Over this scene, newboys are heard selling the 
          Chronicle, their voices growing in volume.

          As the dissolve complete itself, camera moves toward the one 
          lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter 
          but very insistent.

          Kane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the 
          Enquirer building.

          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking 
          out.  The bed is already made up.  On it is seated Bernstein, 
          smoking the end of a cigar.  Leland is in a chair.

                                    NEWSBOYS' VOICES
                        CHRONICLE!  CHRONICLE!  H'YA - THE 
                        CHRONICLE - GET YA!  CHRONICLE!

          Kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window 
          and turns to the others.  The voices of the newsboys, naturally, 
          are very much fainter after this.

                                    LELAND
                        We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - 
                        another ten minutes.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking at his 
                               watch)
                        It's three hours and fifty minutes
                        late - but we did it -

          Leland rises from the chair, stretching painfully.

                                    KANE
                        Tired?

                                    LELAND
                        It's been a tough day.

                                    KANE
                        A wasted day.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking up)
                        Wasted?

                                    LELAND
                               (incredulously)
                        Charlie?!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You just made the paper over four
                        times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -

                                    KANE
                        I've changed the front page a 
                        little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not 
                        enough - There's something I've 
                        got to get into this paper besides 
                        pictures and print -  I've got to 
                        make the "New York Enquirer" as 
                        important to New York as the gas 
                        in that light.

                                    LELAND
                               (quietly)
                        What're you going to do, Charlie?

          Kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy 
          concentration.

                                    KANE
                        My Declaration of Principles -
                               (he says it with 
                               quotes around it)
                        Don't smile, Brad -
                               (getting the idea)
                        Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -

                                    KANE
                        I'll write it myself.

          Kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon.  Sitting 
          down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking over his 
                               shoulder)
                        You don't wanta make any promises, 
                        Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.

                                    KANE
                               (as he writes)
                        These'll be kept.
                               (stops for a minute 
                               and reads what he 
                               has written; reading)
                        I'll provide the people of this 
                        city with a daily paper that will 
                        tell all the news honestly.
                               (starts to write 
                               again; reading as 
                               he writes)
                        will also provide them -

                                    LELAND
                        That's the second sentence you've
                        started with "I" -

                                    KANE
                               (looking up)
                        People are going to know who's 
                        responsible.  And they're going to
                        get the news - the true news -
                        quickly and simply and 
                        entertainingly.
                               (he speaks with 
                               real conviction)
                        And no special interests will be 
                        allowed to interfere with the truth 
                        of that news.

          He looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, 
          reading as he writes.

          Bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane.  They 
          both stand looking out.  Leland joins him on the other side.  
          Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky.  Leland's 
          head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - 
          camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their 
          eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.  
          Bernstein is still smoking a cigar.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page of the "Enquirer" shows big boxed editorial with 
          heading:

          MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE

          Camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the 
          top of a pile of newspapers.  As we draw further back, we see 
          four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six 
          piles and go on back until we see a big field of "Enquirers" - 
          piles of "Enquirers" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution.

          A wagon with a huge sign on its side reading

          "ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000"

          passes through foreground, and we wipe to:

          A pile of "Enquirers" for sale on a broken down wooden box on 
          a street corner, obviously a poor district.  A couple of coins 
          fall on the pile.

          The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can 
          and a bag of rolls.  Across the sidewalk before this, moves 
          the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front 
          wheel.  A copy of the "Enquirer" is tossed on the stoop.

          A breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - 
          everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine.  Into a 
          silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the "Enquirer".  
          Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A 
          DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the 
          front page.

          The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and 
          dark as a train behind the camera rushes by.  On the floor, 
          there is tossed a bound bundle of the "New York Enquirer" - 
          the Declaration of Principles still prominent.

          Rural Delivery - a copy of the "Enquirer"s being put into bins, 
          showing state distribution.

          The railroad platform again.  We stay here for four images.  
          On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles 
          of the "Enquirer" are larger.  On the first image, we move in 
          to hold on the words "CIRCULATION - 31,000."  We are this close 
          for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 
          55,000, and the last which is 62,000.  In each instance, the 
          bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving 
          train behind the camera is increased.

          The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a 
          descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New 
          York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; 
          bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters 
          (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform 
          is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train.

          The last figure "62,000" opposite the word "CIRCULATION" on 
          the "Enquirer" masthead changes to:

          EXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY -

          Angle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting 
          the last zero to the figure "62,000" on an enormous sign 
          advertising the "Enquirer."  It reads:

          THE ENQUIRER  THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER  CIRCULATION 62,000

          Camera travels down side of building - takes in another building 
          on which there is a sign which reads:

          READ THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  CIRCULATION 62,000

          Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the 
          Chronicle office.  The Chronicle office has a plateglass window 
          in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, 
          also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching 
          peanuts.

          Inside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of 
          the "Chronicle" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the 
          center.  A sign over the photo reads: EDITORIAL AND EXECUTIVE 
          STAFF OF THE NEW YORK CHRONICLE.  A sign beneath it reads: 
          GREATEST NEWSPAPER STAFF IN THE WORLD.  The sign also includes 
          the "Chronicle" circulation figure.  There are nine men in the 
          photo.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (looking up at the 
                               sign - happily)
                        Sixty-two thousand -

                                    LELAND
                        That looks pretty nice.

                                    KANE
                               (indicating the 
                               Chronicle Building)
                        Let's hope they like it there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        From the Chronicle Building that 
                        sign is the biggest thing you can 
                        see - every floor guaranteed - 
                        let's hope it bothers them - it 
                        cost us enough.

                                    KANE
                               (pointing to the 
                               sign over the 
                               photograph in the 
                               window)
                        Look at that.

                                    LELAND
                        The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.

                                    KANE
                        It's a good idea for a newspaper.
                               (reading the figures)
                        Four hundred sixy thousand.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Say, with them fellows -
                               (referring to the 
                               photo)
                        - it's no trick to get circulation.

                                    KANE
                        You're right, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (sighs)
                        You know how long it took the 
                        "Chronicle" to get that staff 
                        together?  Twenty years.

                                    KANE
                        I know.

          Kane, smiling, lights a cigarette, at the same time looking 
          into the window.  Camera moves in to hold on the photograph of 
          nine men, still holding the reflection of Kane's smiling face.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Nine men, arrayed as in the photograph, but with Kane beaming 
          in the center of the first row.  The men, variously with 
          mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc. are easily identified as 
          being the same men, Reilly prominent amongst them.

          As camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being 
          photographed - by an old-type professional photographer, big 
          box, black hood and all - in a corner of the room.  It is 1:30 
          at night.  Desks, etc. have been pushed against the wall.  
          Running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, 
          at which twenty diners have finished their meals.  The eleven 
          remaining at their seats - these include Bernstein and Leland - 
          are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        That's all.  Thank you.

          The photographic subjects rise.

                                    KANE
                               (a sudden thought)
                        Make up an extra copy and mail it 
                        to the "Chronicle."

          Chuckling and beaming, he makes his way to his place at the 
          head of the table.  The others have already sat down.  Kane 
          gets his guests' attention by rapping on the table with a knife.

                                    KANE
                        Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This 
                        has, I think, been a fitting welcome
                        to those distinguished journalists -
                               (indicates the eight 
                               men)
                        Mr. Reilly in particular - who are 
                        the latest additions to our ranks.
                        It will make them happy to learn 
                        that the "Enquirer's" circulation 
                        this morning passed the two hundred 
                        thousand mark.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Two hundred and one thousand, six 
                        hundred and forty-seven.

          General applause.

                                    KANE
                        All of you - new and old -  You're 
                        all getting the best salaries in 
                        town.  Not one of you has been 
                        hired because of his loyalty.  
                        It's your talent I'm interested 
                        in.  That talent that's going to 
                        make the "Enquirer" the kind of 
                        paper I want - the best newspaper 
                        in the world!

          Applause.

                                    KANE
                        However, I think you'll agree we've 
                        heard enough about newspapers and 
                        the newspaper business for one 
                        night.  There are other subjects 
                        in the world.

          He puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill 
          whistle.  This is a signal.  A band strikes up a lively ditty 
          of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very 
          magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the 
          chorus costumes of the day.  The rest of this episode will be 
          planned and staged later.  Its essence is that Kane is just a 
          healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time.

          As some of the girls are detached from the line and made into 
          partners for individual dancing -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          THE "ENQUIRER" SIGN:  THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  
          CIRCULATION 274,321

          Dissolve just completes itself - the image of Kane dancing 
          with a girl on each arm just disappears as camera pans down 
          off the Temple Bldg. in the same action as the previous street 
          scene.  There is a new sign on the side of the building below.  
          It reads:

          READ THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD

          Camera continues panning as we

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A montage of various scenes, between the years 1891-1900.

          The scenes indicate the growth of the "Enquirer" under the 
          impulse of Kane's personal drive.  Kane is shown, thus, at 
          various activities:

          Move down from the sign: READ THE ENQUIRER  GREATEST STAFF IN 
          THE WORLD to street in front of saloon with parade passing 
          (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)-  A torchlight 
          parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the 
          saloon - the sound of brass band playing "It's a Hot Time."  
          In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster "REMEMBER 
          THE MAINE"

          INSERT:  Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the 
          parade above, in which "Our Boys" in the expeditionary hats 
          are seen marching off to war.

          Back of observation car.  Shot of Kane congratulating Teddy 
          Roosevelt (the same shot as in the News Digest - without 
          flickering).

          The wooden floor of the railroad platform again - a bundle of 
          "Enquirers" - this time an enormous bundle - is thrown down, 
          and the moving shadows of the train behind the camera indicate 
          that it is going like a bat out of hell.  A reproduction of 
          Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the 
          frame and almost hogs the entire front page.  The headline 
          indicates the surrender of Cuba.

          INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE

          Cartoon, highly dramatic and very involved as to content - 
          lousy with captions, labels, and symbolic figures, the most 
          gruesome and recognizable - "Capitalistic Greed."  This cartoon 
          is almost finished and is on a drawing board before which stand 
          Kane and the artist himself.  Kane is grinning over some 
          suggestion he has made.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          The cartoon finished and reproduced on the editorial page of 
          the "Enquirer" - in quite close, with an editorial and several 
          faces of caps shown underneath.  The entire newspaper is crushed 
          with an angry gesture and thrown down into an expensive-looking 
          wastebasket (which is primarily for ticker tape) tape is 
          pouring.

          INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE

          Cartoonist and Kane working on comic strip of "Johnny the Monk."

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Floor of room -  Two kids on floor, with newspaper spread out, 
          looking at the same comic strip.

          Kane's photographic gallery with photographers, stooges, and 
          Kane himself in attendance on a very hot-looking item of the 
          period.  A sob sister is interviewing this hot number and Kane 
          is arranging her dress to look more seductive.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          The hot number reproduced and prominently displayed and covering 
          almost half a page of the "Enquirer."  It is being read in a 
          barber shop and is seen in an over-shoulder shot of the man 
          who is reading it.  He is getting a shine, a manicure, and a 
          haircut.  The sob-sister caption over the photograph reveals: 
          "I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING, SAYS DANCER.  EVERYTHING WENT 
          RED."  An oval photograph of the gun is included in the lay-
          out of the pretty lady with a headline which says: "DEATH GUN."

          STREET - SHOT OF BUCKET BRIGADE

          Shot of Kane, in evening clothes, in obvious position of danger, 
          grabbing camera from photographer.  Before him rages a terrific 
          tenement fire.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INSERT:  Headline about inadequacy of present fire equipment.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Final shot of a new horse-drawn steam engine roaring around a 
          street corner (Stock).

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A black pattern of iron bars.  We are in a prison cell.  The 
          door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and 
          the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the 
          hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob-
          sister, and Kane.  The photographers take pictures with a mighty 
          flash of old-fashioned flash powder.  The condemned man in the 
          foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A copy of the "Enquirer" spread out on a table.  A big lay-out 
          of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by 
          Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a 
          large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock 
          shot) with a headline indicating that the "Enquirer" has won 
          its campaign for better equipment.  A cup of coffee and a 
          doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose 
          shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee.

          The Beaux Art Ball.  A number of elderly swells are jammed 
          into a hallway.  Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, 
          overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress 
          costume, pink fleshings, etc., the effect to be very surprising, 
          very lavish and very very ridiculous.  We see, among others, 
          Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head 
          and all.  At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes 
          and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of 
          the "New York Enquirer."

          Over the "Enquirer"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball 
          is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a 
          pretty repulsive sight.

          The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can.

          Extreme close-up of the words: "OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST."

          Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page 
          which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality.  
          Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport.

          EXT. CUNARD DOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -

          As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, 
          Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing 
          ocean liner.  Behind the principles can be seen an enormous 
          plain sign which reads: "FIRST CLASS."  From offstage can be 
          heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any Mercury 
          production, the old familiar cry, "All Ashore That's Going 
          Ashore!" - gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the 
          rest of it.

                                    THE OFFICIAL
                        There you are, Mr. Kane.  Everything 
                        in order.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you.

          Kane and Leland and Bernstein start up the gangplank.

                                    THE OFFICIAL
                               (calling)
                        Have a good rest, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy 
                        any more paintings.  Nine Venuses 
                        already we got, twenty-six Virgins - 
                        two whole warehouses full of stuff -

                                    KANE
                        I promise not to bring any more 
                        Venuses and not to worry - and not 
                        to try to get in touch with any of
                        the papers -

                                    STEWARD'S VOICE
                        All ashore!

                                    KANE
                        - and to forget about the new 
                        feature sections - and not to try 
                        to think up and ideas for comic 
                        sections.

                                    STEWARD'S VOICE
                        All ashore that's going ashore!

          Kane leaves Leland and Bernstein midway up gangplank, as he 
          rushes up to it, calling back with a wave:

                                    KANE
                        Goodbye, gents!
                               (at the top of the 
                               gangplank, he turns 
                               and calls down)
                        Hey!

                                    KANE
                               (calling down to 
                               them)
                        You don't expect me to keep any of 
                        those promises, do you?

          A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne."  Bernstein and 
          Leland turn to each other.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Do you, Mr. Leland?

                                    LELAND
                               (smiling)
                        Certainly not.

          They start down the gangplank together.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          LONG SHOT OF THE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT

          The pattern of telegraph wires, dripping with rain, through 
          which we see the same old building but now rendered fairly 
          remarkable by tremendous outline sign in gold which reads "THE 
          NEW YORK DAILY ENQUIRER."  A couple of lights show in the 
          building.  We start toward the window where the lights show, 
          as we -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AT BERNSTEIN'S DESK - NIGHT

          The light in the window in the former shot was showing behind 
          the letter "E" of the Enquirer sign.  Now the letter "E" is 
          even larger than the frame of the camera.  Rain drips 
          disconsolately off the middle part of the figure.  We see 
          through this and through the drizzle of the window to 
          Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded 
          light.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          Same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and 
          late in the winter of the year.  The outline "E" is hung with 
          icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us 
          and Mr. Bernstein, still seated at his desk - still working.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Same setup as before except that it is spring.  Instead of the 
          sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the 
          melancholy cry of a hurdy-gurdy in the street below.  It is 
          spring and through the letter "E" we can see Bernstein working 
          at his desk.  Pigeons are gathering on the "E" and on the sill.  
          Bernstein looks up and sees them.  He takes some crumbs from 
          his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before 
          him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking 
          moodily out on the prospect of spring on Park Row.  The birds 
          eat the crumbs - the hurdy-gurdy continues to play.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          The same setup again, it is now summer.  The window was half-
          open before .. now it's open all the way and Bernstein has 
          gone so far as to take off his coat.  His shirt and his 
          celluloid collar are wringing wet.  Camera moves toward the 
          window to tighten on Bernstein and to take in the City Room 
          behind him, which is absolutely deserted.  It is clear that 
          there is almost nothing more for Bernstein to do.  The hurdy-
          gurdy in the street is playing as before, but a new tune.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          A beach on Coney Island.

          Bernstein in a rented period bathing suit sits alone in the 
          sand, reading a copy of the "Enquirer."

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          The whole floor is now a City Room.  It is twice its former 
          size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using 
          them.  The windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal 
          more light and air.  A wall calendar says September 9th.

          Kane and Bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment.  
          Kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear-
          eyed and tanned.  He is wearing new English clothes.  As they 
          come into the room, Bernstein practically walking sideways, is 
          doing nothing but beaming and admiring Kane, quelling like a 
          mother at the Carnegie Hall debut of her son.  Seeing and 
          recognizing Kane, the entire staff rises to its feet.

                                    KANE
                               (referring to the 
                               staff; with a smile)
                        Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sit down, everybody - for heaven's 
                        sake!

          The order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business 
          of feverish activity.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        So then, tonight, we go over 
                        everything thoroughly, eh?  
                        Especially the new papers -

                                    KANE
                        We certainly do.  Vacation's over -
                        starting right after dinner.  But
                        right now - that lady over there -
                               (he indicates a 
                               woman at the desk)
                        - that's the new society editor, I 
                        take it?  You think I could 
                        interrupt her a moment, Mr. 
                        Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been 
                        away so long I forgot about your
                        joking -

          He trails after Kane as he approaches the Society Editor's 
          desk.  The Society Editor, a middle-aged spinster, sees him 
          approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend 
          she isn't aware of him.  An envelope in her hand shakes 
          violently.  Kane and Bernstein stop at her desk.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Miss Townsend -

          Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein 
          with a stranger.

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                        Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.

          Miss Townsend can't stick to her plan.  She starts to rise, 
          but her legs are none too good under her.  She knocks over a 
          tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up.

                                    KANE
                               (very hesitatingly 
                               and very softly)
                        Miss Townsend -

          At the sound of his voice, she straightens up.  She is very 
          close to death from excitement.

                                    KANE
                        I've been away for several months, 
                        and I don't know exactly how these 
                        things are handled now.  But one 
                        thing I wanted to be sure of is 
                        that you won't treat this little 
                        announcement any differently than 
                        you would any other similar 
                        announcement.

          He hands her an envelope.  She has difficulty in holding on to 
          it.

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        Read it, Miss Townsend.  And 
                        remember - just the regular 
                        treatment!  See you at nine o'clock, 
                        Mr. Bernstein!

          Kane leaves.  Bernstein looks after him, then at the paper.  
          Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope.  A piece 
          of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward.

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                               (reading)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton 
                        announce the engagement of their 
                        daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to 
                        Mr.  Charles Foster Kane.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (starts to read it)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton
                        announce -

                                    MISS TOWNSEND
                               (fluttering - on 
                               top of him)
                        She's - she's the niece of - of 
                        the President of the United States -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (nodding proudly)
                        know.  Come on, Miss Townsend -
                        From the window, maybe we can get 
                        a look.

          He takes her by the hand and leads her off.

          Angle toward open window.  Bernstein and Miss Townsend, backs 
          to camera, rushing to the window.

          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

          High angle downward - what Bernstein and Miss Townsend see 
          from the window.

          Kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch, drawn up at the 
          curb, in which sits Miss Emily Norton.  He kisses her full on 
          the lips before he sits down.  She acts a bit taken aback, 
          because of the public nature of the scene, but she isn't really 
          annoyed.  As the barouche starts off, she is looking at him 
          adoringly.  He, however, has turned his head and is looking 
          adoringly at the "Enquirer."  He apparently sees Bernstein and 
          Miss Townsed and waves his hand.

          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER - DAY -

          Bernstein and Miss Townsend at window.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        A girl like that, believe me, she's 
                        lucky!  Presiden't niece, huh!  
                        Say, before he's through, she'll 
                        be a Presiden't wife.

          Miss Townsend is now dewey-eyed.  She looks at Bernstein, who 
          has turned away, gazing down at the departing couple.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Front page of the "Enquirer."  Large picture of the young couple - 
          Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - DAY -

          Bernstein and Thompson.  As the dissolve comes, Bernstein's 
          voice is heard.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        The way things turned out, I don't 
                        need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton 
                        was no rosebud!

                                    THOMPSON
                        It didn't end very well, did it?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (shaking his head)
                        It ended -
                               (a slight pause)
                        Then there was Susie - that ended, 
                        too.
                               (shrugs, a pause; 
                               then looking up 
                               into Thompson's 
                               eyes)
                        guess he didn't make her very happy -

                                    (A PAUSE)
                        You know, I was thinking - that 
                        Rosebud you're trying to find out 
                        about -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes -

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Maybe that was something he lost.  
                        Mr. Kane was a man that lost - 
                        almost everything he had -
                               (a pause)
                        You ought to talk to Bradford 
                        Leland.  He could tell you a lot.  
                        I wish I could tell you where Leland 
                        is, but I don't know myself.  He 
                        may be out of town somewhere - he 
                        may be dead.

                                    THOMPSON
                        In case you'd like to know, Mr.
                        Bernstein, he's at the Huntington 
                        Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        You don't say!  Why I had no idea -

                                    THOMPSON
                        Nothing particular the matter with
                        him, they tell me.  Just -
                               (controls himself)

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Just old age.
                               (smiles sadly)
                        It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, 
                        you don't look forward to being 
                        cured of.
                               (pauses)
                        You ought to see Mr. Leland.  
                        There's a whole lot of things he 
                        could tell you - if he wanted to.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Close shot - Thompson.  He is tilted back in a chair which 
          seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney.  Leland's voice 
          is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen.

                                    LELAND'S VOICE
                        When you get to my age, young man, 
                        you don't miss anything.  Unless 
                        maybe it's a good drink of bourbon.
                        Even that doesn't make much 
                        difference, if you remember there 
                        hasn't been any good bourbon in 
                        this country for twenty years.

          Camera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that 
          Leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to 
          Thompson.  They are on the flat roof of a hospital.  Other 
          people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along 
          with a nurse or two.  They are all sunning themselves.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Mr. Leland, you were -

                                    LELAND
                        You don't happen to have a cigar, 
                        do you?  I've got a young physician - 
                        must remember to ask to see his 
                        license - the odds are a hundred 
                        to one he hasn't got one - who 
                        thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  
                        I changed the subject, didn't I?  
                        Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable 
                        old man I've become.  You want to 
                        know what I think of Charlie Kane?  
                        Well - I suppose he has some private 
                        sort of greatness.  But he kept it 
                        to himself.
                               (grinning)
                        He never - gave himself away -  He
                        never gave anything away.  He just -
                        left you a tip.  He had a generous 
                        mind.  I don't suppose anybody 
                        ever had so many opinions.  That 
                        was because he had the power to 
                        express them, and Charlie lived on 
                        power and the excitement of using 
                        it -  But he didn't believe in
                        anything except Charlie Kane.  He 
                        never had a conviction in his life.  
                        I guess he died without one -  
                        That must have been pretty 
                        unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of 
                        us check out with no special 
                        conviction about death.  But we do 
                        know what we're leaving ... we 
                        believe in something.
                               (looks sharply at 
                               Thompson)
                        You're absolutely sure you haven't 
                        got a cigar?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sorry, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        Never mind -  Bernstein told you 
                        about the first days at the office, 
                        didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a 
                        bad newspaper man even then.  He 
                        entertained his readers, but he 
                        never told them the truth.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Maybe you could remember something
                        that -

                                    LELAND
                        I can remember everything.  That's 
                        my curse, young man.  It's the 
                        greatest curse that's ever been 
                        inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  
                        I was his oldest friend.
                               (slowly)
                        As far as I was concerned, he 
                        behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' 
                        his friend.  If I wasn't, he never 
                        had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays
                        you call a stooge -

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          The party (previously shown in the Bernstein sequence).

          We start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but 
          from a fresh angle, holding on Leland, who is at the end of 
          the table.  Kane is heard off, making a speech.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Not one of you has been hired 
                        because of his loyalty.  It's your 
                        talent I'm interested in.  That 
                        talent that's going to make the 
                        "Enquirer" the kind of paper I 
                        want - the best newspaper in the 
                        world!

          Applause.  During above, Bernstein has come to Leland's side.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!

                                    LELAND
                        Yes.

          His tone causes Bernstein to look at him.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        However, I think you'll agree we've 
                        heard enough about newspapers and 
                        the newspaper business for one 
                        night.

          The above speeches are heard under the following dialogue.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (to Leland)
                        What's the matter?

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, these men who are 
                        now with the "Enquirer" - who were 
                        with the "Chronicle" until yesterday -
                        weren't they just as devoted to 
                        the "Chronicle" kind of paper as 
                        they are now to - our kind of paper?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Sure.  They're like anybody else.
                        They got work to do.  They do it.
                               (proudly)
                        Only they happen to be the best 
                        men in the business.

                                    KANE
                               (finishing his speech)
                        There are other subjects in the 
                        world -

          Kane whistles.  The band and the chorus girls enter and hell 
          breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein.

                               (after a minute)
                        Do we stand for the same things 
                        that the "Chronicle" stands for, 
                        Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (indignantly)
                        Certainly not.  So what's that got 
                        to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll 
                        have them changed to his kind of 
                        newspapermen in a week.

                                    LELAND
                        Probably.  There's always a chance, 
                        of course, that they'll change Mr.
                        Kane - without his knowing it.

          Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein.  He sits down next 
          to them, lighting a cigarette.

                                    KANE
                        Well, gentlemen, are we going to 
                        war?

                        Our readers are, anyway, I don't

                        It'll be our first foreign war in 
                        fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it 
                        the way the "Hickville Gazette" 
                        covers the church social!  The

                        they wore; what they ate; who won

                        But there is no Front, Charlie.
                        There's a very doubtful civil war.
                        Besides, I don't want the job.

                        All right, Brad, all right - you 
                        don't have to be a war correspondent 
                        unless you want to - I'd want to.

                        Hello, Georgie.

          Georgie, a very handsome madam has walked into the picture, 
          stands behind him.  She leans over and speaks quietly in his 
          ear.

                                    GEORGIE
                        Is everything the way you want it,

                        the way I want it.

                        Charles, I tell you there is no 
                        war!  There's a condition that 
                        should be remedied - but between 
                        that and a -

                        How would the "Enquirer" look with 
                        no news about this non-existent 
                        war - with Benton, Pulitzer and 
                        Heart devoting twenty columns a

                        I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad -
                        you know, Georgie, don't you?

          Leland nods.

          Leland shudders.

                        I told you about Brad, Georgie.
                        He needs to relax.

          INT. GEORGIE'S PLACE - NIGHT -

          Georgie is introducing a young lady to Branford Leland.  On 
          sound track we hear piano music.

                                    GEORGIE
                               (right on cue from 
                               preceding scene)
                        Ethel - this gentlemen has been 
                        very anxious to meet you -  This 
                        is Ethel.

                                    ETHEL
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

          Camera pans to include Kane, seated at piano, with girls 
          gathered around him.

                                    ONE OF THE GIRLS
                        Charlie!  Play the song about you.

                                    ANOTHER GIRL
                        Is there a song about Charlie?

          Kane has broken into "Oh, Mr. Kane!" and Charlie and the girls 
          start to sing.  Ethel leads the unhappy Leland over to the 
          group.  Kane, seeing Leland and taking his eye, motions to the 
          professor who has been standing next to him to take over.  The 
          professor does so.  The singing continues.  Kane rises and 
          crosses to Leland.

                                    KANE
                        Say, Brad.
                               (draws him slightly 
                               aside)
                        I've got an idea.

                                    LELAND
                        Yes?

                                    KANE
                        I mean I've got a job for you.

                                    LELAND
                        Good.

                                    KANE
                        You don't want to be a war 
                        correspondent - how about being a 
                        dramatic critic?

                                    LELAND

                               gushing; seriously)
                        I'd like that.

          Kane starts quietly to dance in time to the music.  Leland 
          smiles at him.

                        You start tomorrow night.  Richard

                        I'll get us some girls.  You get 
                        tickets.  A drama critic gets them

                        It doesn't make any difference 
                        about me, but one of these days 
                        you're going to find out that all 
                        this charm of yours won't be enough -

                        You're wrong.  It does make a 
                        difference to you -  Rector's, 
                        Brad?

                               again)
                        Come to think of it, I don't blame 
                        you for not wanting to be a war 
                        correspondent.  You won't miss 
                        anything.  It isn't much of a war.
                        Besides, they tell me there isn't 
                        a decent restaurant on the whole 
                        island.

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. RECTOR'S - NIGHT -

          Leland, Kane, two young ladies at Rector's.  Popular music is 
          heard over the soundtrack.  Everybody is laughing very, very 
          hard at something Kane has said.  The girls are hysterical.  
          Kane can hardly breathe.  As Leland's laughter becomes more 
          and more hearty, it only increases the laughter of the others.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. CUNARD LOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT -

          As told by Bernstein.  Kane is calling down to Leland and 
          Bernstein (as before).

                                    KANE
                        You don't expect me to keep any of 
                        those promises, do you?

          A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne" and further ship-to-
          shore conversation is rendered unfeasible.

          Bernstein and Leland on deck.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (turns to Leland)
                        Do you, Mr. Leland?

                                    LELAND
                               (smiling)
                        Certainly not.

          Slight pause.  They continue on their way.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to 
                        Europe with him?  He wanted you
                        to.  He said to me just yesterday -

                                    LELAND
                        I wanted him to have fun - and 
                        with me along -

          This stops Bernstein.  Bernstein looks at him.

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me
                        ask you a few questions, and answer 
                        me truthfully.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Don't I always?  Most of the time?

                                    LELAND
                        Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?  
                        Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am 
                        I a New England school-marm?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Yes.

          Leland is surprised.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        If you thought I'd answer different 
                        from what Mr. Kane tells you - 
                        well, I wouldn't.

                                    LELAND
                               (good naturedly)
                        You're in a conspiracy against me, 
                        you two.  You always have been.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Against me there should be such a 
                        conspiracy some time!

          He pauses.  "Auld Lang Syne" can still be heard from the deck 
          of the department steamer.

                        Well, he'll be coming back in 
                        September.  The Majestic.  I got 
                        the reservations.  It gets in on

                        September the ninth?

          Leland puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out a pencil and 
          small engagement book, opens the book and starts to write.

          Leland's pencil writing on a page in the engagement book open

          EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

          Leland and Thompson.  Leland is speaking as we dissolve.

                                    LELAND
                        I used to go to dancing school 
                        with her.

          Thompson had handed Leland a paper.

                                    LELAND
                        What's this?

                                    THOMPSON
                        It's a letter from her lawyers.

                                    LELAND
                               (reading aloud from 
                               the letter)
                        David, Grobleski & Davis -  My
                        dear Rawlston -
                               (looks up)

                                    THOMPSON
                        Rawlston is my boss.

                                    LELAND
                        Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.

                                    THOMPSON
                        He knows the first Mrs. Kane 
                        socially -  That's the answer we 
                        got.

                                    LELAND
                               (reading)
                        I am in receipt of your favor of 
                        yesterday.  I beg you to do me the 
                        courtesy of accepting my assurance 
                        that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be 
                        induced to contribute any more 
                        information on the career of Charles 
                        Foster Kane.

          She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she 
          regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her 
          life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest 
          esteem - Leland hands the paper back to Thompson.

                                    LELAND
                        Brief marriage!  Ten years!
                               (sighs)

                                    THOMPSON
                        Was he in love?

                                    LELAND
                        He married for love -
                               (a little laugh)
                        That's why he did everything.  
                        That's why he went into politics.  
                        It seems we weren't enough.  He 
                        wanted all the voters to love him, 
                        too.  All he really wanted out of 
                        life was love.  That's Charlie's 
                        story - it's the story of how he 
                        lost it.  You see, he just didn't 
                        have any to give.  He loved Charlie 
                        Kane, of course, very dearly - and 
                        his mother, I guess he always loved 
                        her.  As for Emily - well, all I 
                        can tell you is Emily's story as 
                        she told it to me, which probably 
                        isn't fair - there's supposed to 
                        be two sides to every story - and 
                        I guess there are.  I guess there's
                        more than two sides -

          INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY -

          This scene is shot so as never to show the President - or at 
          least never his face.  There is present the President's 
          Secretary, sitting on one side of the desk, intently taking 
          notes.  Kane is on his feet, in front of the desk, tense and 
          glaring.

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        It is the unanimous opinion of my 
                        Cabinent - in which I concur - 
                        that the proposed leases are in 
                        the best interests of the 
                        Governement and the people.
                               (pauses)
                        You are not, I hope, suggesting 
                        that these interests are not 
                        indentical?

                                    KANE
                        I'm not suggesting anything, Mr.
                        President!  I've come here to tell 
                        you that, unless some action is 
                        taken promptly - and you are the 
                        only one who can take it - the oil 
                        that is the property of the people 
                        of this country will be turned 
                        over for a song to a gang of high-
                        pressure crooks!

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                               (calmly)
                        I must refuse to allow you to 
                        continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                               (screaming)
                        It's the only vein I know.  I tell 
                        the facts the way I see them.  And
                        any man that knows that facts -

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I 
                        happen to have the incredible 
                        insolence to differ with you as to 
                        what they mean.
                               (pause)
                        You're a man of great talents, Mr. 
                        Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                        I understand that you have political 
                        ambitions.  Unfortunately, you 
                        seem incapable of allowing any 
                        other opinion but your own -

                                    KANE
                               (building to a frenzy)
                        I'm much obliged, Mr. President, 
                        for your concern about me.  However, 
                        I happen to be concerned at this 
                        moment with the matter of extensive 
                        oil lands belonging to the people 
                        of the United States, and I say 
                        that if this lease goes through, 
                        the property of the people of the 
                        United States goes into the hands 
                        of -

                                    THE PRESIDENT
                               (interrupting)
                        You've made your point perfectly 
                        clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.

          The Secretary rises.  Kane, with every bit of will power 
          remotely at his disposal to control what might become an 
          hysterical outburst, manages to bow.

                        Mr. President.

          He starts out of the office.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. COMPOSING ROOM - ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Kane, Reilly, Leland and a composing room Foreman, in working 
          clothes, bending over a table with several forms of type.  
          They are looking, at this moment, at a made-up headline - but 
          Kane's back is in the way ... so we can't read it.

                                    FOREMAN
                        How about it, Mr. Kane?

          Reilly glances at his wrist watch and makes a face.  Kane smiles 
          as he notices this.

                                    KANE
                        All right.  Let her slide!

          He turns away, and we can now read the headline.

          Insert of the headline, which reads: "OIL THEFT BECOMES LAW AS 
          PRESIDENT WITHOLDS VETO"

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Here follows a quick montage (presently to be worked out) of 
          no more than four or five images in which the President, by 
          means of cartoons, editorials, headlines (all faithfully 
          reproduced from period yellow journalism) is violently attacked.  
          The montage ends on the word TREASON.  The music cuts.

          A hand reaches in a side pocket which contains a newspaper - 
          recognizably the "Enquirer."  The hand removes a gun.  The gun 
          is shot.  Many arms seize the hand which is pulled up - gun 
          still firing.  As the arm is raised in the air, we see that 
          the other arms holding the arm and struggling with it are 
          uniformed, and we see the White House beyond.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          shows a crowd forming, looking angrily up toward the camera.  
          Crowd noises on the soundtrack under music.

          A hand snatches the ticker tape away and as the image of the 
          crowd dissolves out, we pull back to show:

          The camera is in tight on a box which contains Emily and 
          distinguished elderly ladies and gentlemen, obviously family 
          and friends.  On the soundtrack, very limpid opera music.  
          Another elderly gent, in white tie but still wearing an 
          overcoat, comes into the box and whispers to Emily.  He has a 
          copy of the "Enquirer" in his hand.  Emily rises.  He shows 
          the paper to her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          An angry crowd seen from the window of Kane's office.  They

          following scene.  Across the heads of the crowd are two great 
          squares of light from the windows above them.  One of these 
          disappears as the blind is pulled.  As the dissolve completes 
          itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, 
          and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland 
          pulls down, covering the entire frame.

                        Yes?

                                    LELAND
                        Do you think you're the one who 
                        should call him a great man?

                                    KANE
                        Why not?

                                    LELAND
                        Why not?  Well - nobody's a great 
                        man in your estimation until he's 
                        dead.

                        Maybe we'd better wait for more 
                        word on the President's condition.

                               Leland)
                        What do you mean by that?

                                    LELAND

                        Competition.

                                    REILLY
                        He may recover -

                               Leland)
                        What do you mean by that?

                               (steadily)
                        Yesterday morning you called the 
                        President a traitor.  What do you 
                        think that crowd is doing down 
                        there?  They think you murdered 
                        him.

                                    KANE
                        Because the crackpot who did it 
                        had a copy of the "Enquirer" in 
                        his pocket?

                                    LELAND
                        - and that copy of the "Enquirer" 
                        said the President should be killed.

                                    KANE
                        I said treason was a capital offense
                        punishable by death -

                                    LELAND
                        You've said a lot of things about 
                        the President in the last few 
                        months.

                        They're true!  Everything I said!
                        Witholding that veto was treason!

                                    LELAND
                               (interrupting)
                        Charlie!

                        Oil belonging to the people of the

                        song to a gang of high-pressure
                        crooks -  Nobody can blame me

                        Look out that window.

          Kane stops - looks at him.

                                    LELAND
                        There are the people of the United
                        States, and they are blaming you -
                        Oh, I know it doesn't make any 
                        sense, but at least you can learn 
                        a lesson from it.

                               (snarling)
                        What lesson?  Not to expose fraud 
                        when I see it?  Not to fight for 
                        the right of the people to own 
                        their own property?
                               (he turns to Reilly)
                        Run it the way I said, Reilly - 
                        "This afternoon a great man was 
                        assassinated -"

                                    LELAND
                        Charlie!  Now you're not making 
                        sense.

                                    KANE

                        I don't have to.  I run a newspaper 
                        with half a million readers and 
                        they're getting a martyred president 
                        this morning with their breakfast.
                        I can't help that.  Besides, they 
                        all know I'm married to his niece.  
                        I've got to think of her.

                                    LELAND
                        What?

                                    KANE
                        I've got to think of Emily -

                                    LELAND
                               (after a silence)
                        I'd like to talk to you about that.

                                    KANE
                        Go ahead.

          Leland looks back at Kane, is conscious of the boys standing 
          around.

                                    LELAND
                        Finish your editorial.

          Leland walks out in to the City Room.  More staff members in 
          shirt sleeves in a state of panic.  Leland goes to his desk, 
          takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink.  A door 
          opens.  A Policeman enters with Bernstein.  Bernstein is badly 
          battered.  The boys crowd around.

                                    LELAND
                               (worried)
                        What's happened?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (smiling)
                        I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only 
                        there was some fellows out front 
                        that thought they ought to take 
                        things up with me.  I learned 'em!
                        Didn't I, officer?

                                    THE COP
                               (grinning)
                        You sure did -  Say, the 
                        Commissioner said I was to stand 
                        by and protect Mr. Kane until 
                        further orders, no matter how he 
                        felt about it.  Where is he?

                                    LELAND
                               (finishing his drink)
                        In there.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        If you hadn't come along and 
                        protected me when you did, I'd 
                        have killed them fellows.

                                    LELAND
                               (pouring himself 
                               another drink)
                        Go and get yourself washed up, Mr.
                        Bernstein.
                               (he looks his face 
                               over thoroughly)
                        There doesn't seem to be an serious 
                        injury.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Not to me.  But you will let that 
                        cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't 
                        you?

                                    LELAND
                        Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

          Bernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance.  
          Leland finishes his second drink.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT -

          The bottle is finished.  The door in the Sanctrum opens.  Reilly 
          and the others leave.

                                    REILLY
                               (as they go)
                        Goodnight, Mr. Kane.

          Kane stands in the door, waiting for Leland.  Leland gets up 
          and moves toward the office - goes in, sits down across from 
          Kane at the desk.  An uncomfortable pause.  Then Kane smiles 
          ingratiatingly.  Leland tries to cope with this.

                                    LELAND
                        First of all -
                               (he can't go on)

                                    KANE
                               (not cruelly - 
                               genuinely kind)
                        What's wrong, Brad?

                                    LELAND
                        I'm drunk.

                                    KANE
                        I'll get you some coffee.

          He rises and goes to the door.

                                    LELAND
                        First of all, I will not write a 
                        good review of a play because 
                        somebody paid a thousand dollars 
                        for an advertisement in the 
                        "Enquirer."

                                    KANE
                               (gently - opening 
                               the door)
                        That's just a little promotion 
                        scheme.  Nobody expects you -
                               (calling)
                        Mike, will you try and get Mr. 
                        Leland some coffee?

                                    MIKE'S VOICE
                        Sure thing, Mr. Kane.

          Kane turns back to Leland.  Leland doesn't look up at him.

                                    LELAND
                        Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't 
                        agree anymore.  I wish you'd let 
                        me go to Chicago.

                                    KANE
                        Why, Brad?

                                    LELAND
                        I want to be transferred to the 
                        new paper.  You've been saying 
                        yourself you wish you had somebody 
                        to -
                               (he is heartsick, 
                               inarticulate)
                        That's not what I wanted to talk 
                        about.

          Kane goes around behind the desk and sits down.

                                    KANE
                        I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad -
                        I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll 
                        help.

                                    LELAND
                        No, that won't help.  Besides, you 
                        never get drunk.  I wanted to talk 
                        about you and Emily.

          Kane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks.

                                    KANE
                               (quietly)
                        All right.

                                    LELAND
                               (without looking at 
                               him)
                        She's going to leave you -

                                    KANE
                        I don't think so, Brad.  We've 
                        just had word that the President 
                        is out of danger.
                               (ruefully)
                        It seems I didn't kill him after 
                        all.

                                    LELAND
                               (takes his eye)
                        She was going to leave you anyway -

          Kane takes this in.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily's going south next week with 
                        the child.  As far as anybody's to 
                        know, it's a holiday.  When they 
                        get back -

                               (sharply)
                        Brad, you are drunk.

                                    LELAND
                        Sure I am.  She wants full custody 
                        of the child no matter what happens.
                        If you won't agree to that, she'll 
                        apply for a divorce regardless of 
                        the President's wishes.  I can't 
                        tell her she's wrong, because she 
                        isn't wrong -

                                    KANE
                        Why is she leaving me?

                                    LELAND
                               (it's very hard for 
                               him to say all 
                               this)
                        She hasn't any friends left sine 
                        you started this oil business, and 
                        she never sees you.

                                    KANE
                        Do you think the "Enquirer" 
                        shouldn't have campaigned against 
                        the oil leases?

                                    LELAND
                               (hesitating)
                        You might have made the whole thing 
                        less personal!

          No answer from Kane.

                                    LELAND
                        It isn't just that the President 
                        was her uncle - everyone she knows, 
                        all the people she's been brought 
                        up with, everything she's ever 
                        been taught to believe is important -

          Still no answer from Kane.

                                    LELAND
                        There's no reason why this - this
                        savage personal note -

                                    KANE
                        The personal note is all there is 
                        to it.  It's all there ever is to 
                        it.  It's all there every is to 
                        anything!  Stupidity in our 
                        government, complacency and self-
                        satisfaction and unwillingness to 
                        believe that anything done by a 
                        certain class of people can be 
                        wrong - you can't fight those things 
                        impersonally.  They're not 
                        impersonal crimes against people.  
                        They're being done by actual persons - 
                        with actual names and positions 
                        and - the right of the American 
                        people to own their own country is 
                        not an academic issue, Brad, that 
                        you debate - and then the judges 
                        retire to return a verdict and the 
                        winners give a dinner for the 
                        losers.

                                    LELAND
                        You almost convince me.
                               (rising)
                        I'm just drunk enough to tell you 
                        the truth.  I have to be a little 
                        drunk for that because I'm a coward.  
                        You know that.  That's why you 
                        keep me around.
                               (smiles)
                        You only associate with your 
                        inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's 
                        why you ran away from Emily.  
                        Because you can't stand the company 
                        of your equals.  You don't like to 
                        admit they exist - the other big 
                        people in your world are dead.
                        I told you that.

          Kane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now.  He 
          speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal 
          indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a 
          disease.

                                    LELAND
                        You talk about the people of the 
                        United States as though they 
                        belonged to you.  When you find 
                        out they don't think they are, 
                        you'll lose interest.  You talk 
                        about giving them their rights as 
                        though you could make a present of 
                        liberty.  Remember the working 
                        man?  You used to defend him quite 
                        a good deal.  Well, he's turning 
                        into something called organized 
                        labor and you don't like that at 
                        all.  And listen, when your precious 
                        underprivileged really get together - 
                        that's going to add up to something 
                        bigger than - than your privilege 
                        and then I don't know what you'll 
                        do - sail away to a desert island, 
                        probably, and lord it over the 
                        monkeys.

                                    KANE
                        Are you finished?

                                    LELAND
                        Yes.
                               (looking down)
                        Now, will you let me go to Chicago?

                                    KANE
                               (with a little smile)
                        You're not going to like it in 
                        Chicago.  They wind comes howling 
                        in from the lake.  And there's
                        practically no opera season at all -
                        and the Lord only knows whether
                        they've ever heard of Lobster 
                        Newburg -

                                    LELAND
                        That's all right.
                               (he won't be charmed 
                               out of his duty)
                        What are you going to do about 
                        Emily?

                                    KANE
                               (his face hardning 
                               a little)
                        Nothing - if she dosen't love me -

          Leland has risen.  He speaks as he turns away, starting towards 
          the door.

                                    LELAND
                        You want love on your own terms,
                        don't you, Charlie -
                               (he stops - his 
                               back turned to 
                               Kane)
                        Love according to your own rules.
                        And if anything goes wrong and 
                        you're hurt - then the game stops, 
                        and you've got to be soothed and 
                        nursed, no matter what else is 
                        happening - and no matter who else 
                        is hurt!

                                    KANE
                        It's simpler than that, Brad.  A 
                        society girl can't stand the gaff, 
                        that's all.  Other things are 
                        important to her - social position, 
                        what they're saying on the front 
                        porches at Southampton, is it going 
                        to be embarrassing to meet somebody
                        or the other at dinner -

          Leland has turned, taking his eye again.  Now Kane stops and 
          smiles.

                                    KANE
                        She can leave me.  As a matter of 
                        fact, I've already left her.  Don't 
                        worry, Brad - I'll live.

                                    LELAND
                        I know you will.

                                    KANE
                               (with all his charm)
                        Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an 
                        awful lot tonight - let's have 
                        another brandy.

          Leland shakes his head.  Kane lifts his glass.

                                    KANE
                        To love on my terms.  Those are 
                        the only terms anybody knows ...  
                        his own.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT -

          Kane, Leland, and a couple of policemen make their way out of 
          the front toward a hansom cab.

                                    A VOICE FROM THE CROWD
                        You moiderer!

          A rock is thrown.  It hits Leland on the face.  A little blood 
          flows.  Kane doesn't see it at first.  Then when he's in the 
          hansom cab, he turns and notices it.

                                    KANE
                        Are you hurt?

          Leland has a handkerchief to his face.

                                    LELAND
                        No.  I wish you'd go home to Emily.
                        She'll be pretty upset by all this -
                        She still loves you -

          The crowd, pushed by the cops, retreats in the background, but 
          still hard by.

                                    KANE
                        You still want to be transferred 
                        to the other paper?

                        Well, you've been getting a pretty 
                        low salary here in New York.  It 
                        seems to me that the new dramatic 
                        critic of our Chicago paper should 
                        get what he's worth.
                               (almost as a question)

                               still attached to 
                               his face)
                        I couldn't possibly live on as 
                        little as that, Charlie.  We'll 
                        let the salary stay where it is.

          The hansom cab starts up.  We hold on Leland's face as we

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - KANE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING -

          Emily is in bed, a damp cloth over her temples.  Kane is 
          standing at the foot of the bed.  The baby's bed is in a corner 
          of the room.  The baby's nurse is standing near the crib, a 
          nurse for Emily is near her.  Kane is looking fixedly on Emily, 
          who is staring tiredly at the ceiling.

                                    KANE
                               (to the nurse)
                        Excuse us a moment, please.

          The nurse looks at Emily.

                                    KANE
                               (peremptorily)
                        I said, excuse us a moment.

          The nurse, unwilling, leaves.

                                    KANE
                        I've been talking to Leland.  Emily -
                        You can't leave me now - not now -

          Silence.

                                    KANE
                        It isn't what it would do to my 
                        changes in politics, Emily -  That 
                        isn't it -  They were talking of 
                        running me for governor, but now,
                        of course, we'll have to wait -
                        It isn't that, Emily -  It's just -
                        the president is your uncle and 
                        they're saying I killed him.

          Still silence.

                                    KANE
                        That story about the murderer having 
                        a copy of the "Enquirer" in his 
                        pocket - the "Chronicle" made that 
                        up out of whole cloth -  Emily, 
                        please - He's going to be all right, 
                        you know, he's going to recover -
                               (bitterly)
                        If it will make you any happier, 
                        we had nine pages of advertising 
                        cancelled in the first mail this 
                        morning.  Bernstein is afraid to 
                        open any more letters.  He -

          He stops.  He sees that he's getting no place with Emily.

                                    KANE
                               (exasperated)
                        What do you expect me to do?  What
                        in the world -

                                    EMILY
                               (weakly)
                        Charles.

          He waits for her to continue.

                                    EMILY
                        Do you really think -
                               (she can't continue)
                        Those threatening letters, can
                        they really -

          She sits up and looks at the crib.  She almost continues to 
          look at the crib, with almost unseeing eyes.

                                    KANE
                               (uncomfortably)
                        They won't do anything to Junior, 
                        darling.
                               (contemptuously)
                        Anonymous letter writers -   I've 
                        got guards in front of the house,
                        and I'm going to arrange -

                                    EMILY
                               (turning her face 
                               toward him)
                        Please don't talk any more, Charles.

          Kane is about to say something, but bites his lips instead.  
          Emily keeps staring at him.

                                    EMILY
                        Have they heard from father yet?
                        Has he seen -

                                    KANE
                        I've tried to tell you, Emily.
                        The President's going to be all 
                        right.  He had a comfortable night.
                        There's no danger of any kind.

          Emily nods several times.  There is an uncomforable silence.  
          Suddenly there is a cry from the crib.  Emily leaps from the 
          bed and rushes to him.  She bends over the crib.

                                    EMILY
                               (murmuring)
                        Here I am, darling...  Darling!...  
                        Darling, it's all right...  Mother's 
                        here.

                                    KANE
                        Emily - you musn't leave me now -
                        you can't do that to me.

                                    EMILY
                        They won't hurt you, darling.
                        Mother's with you!  Mother's looking 
                        after you!

          Kane, unwanted, ignored, looks on.  Tightening his lips, he 
          walks out.

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          By the desk light, Kane is seen working with his usual 
          intensity,  Reilly standing beside him at the desk.

                                    KANE
                        We'll withdraw support completely.
                        Anything else?

                                    REILLY
                        Mr. Leland sent back that check.

                                    KANE
                        What check?

                                    REILLY
                        You made it out to him last week 
                        after he left for Chicago.

                                    KANE
                        Oh, yes, the bonus.

                                    REILLY
                        It was for twenty-five thousand 
                        dollars.

          Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his 
          mind will be on something else.

                                    REILLY
                        He sent it back torn up - all torn 
                        up into little bits, and he enclosed 
                        something else -  I can't make it 
                        out.

          Kane doesn't answer.  Reilly goes on.  He has brought out a 
          piece of paper and is reading it.

                                    REILLY
                        It says here, "A Declaration of
                        Principles" -
                               (he still reads)
                        "I will provide the people of this 
                        city with a daily paper that will
                        tell all the news honestly" -

          Kane has looked up sharply.  Reilly, sensing his look, stops 
          reading and meets his eye.  Slowly, Kane reaches out his hand.  
          Reilly hands him the piece of paper.  Without reading it, Kane 
          tears it up, throws it into the wastebasket at his side.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          The evening of the final great rally.  These shots remind us 
          of and are identical with and supplementary to the "News Digest" 
          scenes earlier.  The vast auditorium with a huge picture of 
          Kane, cheering crowds, etc.  Emily and Junior are to be seen 
          in the front of a box.  Emily is tired and wears a forced smile 
          on her face.  Junior, now aged nine and a half, is eager, bright-
          eyed and excited.  Kane is just finishing his speech.

                                    KANE
                        It is no secret that I entered 
                        upon this campaign with no thought 
                        that I could be elected Governor 
                        of this state!  It is now no secret 
                        that every straw vote, every 
                        independent pole, shows that I 
                        will be elected.  And I repeat to 
                        you - my first official act as 
                        Governor will be to appoint a 
                        special District Attorney to arrange 
                        for the indictment, prosecution 
                        and conviction of Boss Edward G. 
                        Rogers!

          Terrific screaming and cheering from the audience.

          INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          The Speaker's Platform.  Numerous officials and civic leaders 
          are crowding around Kane.  Cameramen take flash photographs 
          with old-fashioined flash powder.

                                    FIRST CIVIC LEADER
                        Great speech, Mr. Kane.

                                    SECOND LEADER
                               (pompous)
                        One of the most notable public 
                        utterances ever made by a candidate
                        in this state -

                                    KANE
                        Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.

          He looks up and notices that the box in which Emily and the 
          boy were sitting is now empty.  He starts toward the rear of 
          the platform, through the press of people, Reilly approaches 
          him.

                                    REILLY
                        A wonderful speech, Mr. Kane.

          Kane pats him on the shoulder as he walks along.

                                    REILLY
                        I just got word from Buffalo, Mr.
                        Kane.  They're going to throw you 
                        the organization vote - and take a 
                        chance maybe you'll give them a
                        break -

          This is said almost inquiringly, as if he were hoping that 
          Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not making 
          a mistake.  There is no answer from Kane.

                                    REILLY
                        On an independent ticket there's 
                        never been anything like it!  If 
                        the election were held today, you'd 
                        be elected by a hundred thousand 
                        votes - and every day between now 
                        and November 7th is just going to 
                        add to your majority.

          Kane is very pleased.  He continues with Reilly slowly through 
          the crowd - a band playing off.  Bernstein joins him.

                                    KANE
                        It does seem too good to be true, 
                        doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    REILLY
                        Rogers isn't even pretending.  He 
                        isn't just scared anymore.  He's 
                        sick.  Frank Norris told me last 
                        night he hasn't known Rogers to be 
                        that worried in twenty-five years.

                                    KANE
                        I think it's beginning to dawn on 
                        Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say.
                        With Mr. Rogers out of the way, 
                        Reilly, I think we may really begin 
                        to hope for a good government in 
                        this state.
                               (stopping)
                        Well, Mr. Bernstein?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (clearly not meaning 
                               it)
                        It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  
                        Wonderful.  Wonderful.

                                    KANE
                        You don't really think so?

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're 
                        running for Governor - and you 
                        want to be elected -  I think it's 
                        wonderful you're going to be 
                        elected.  Only -
                               (interrupts himself)
                        -  Can I say something?

                                    KANE
                        Please, Mr. Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, the way I look at it -
                               (comes out with it)
                        -  You want to know what I really 
                        think would be wonderful?

          Kane indicates he is to proceed.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Well, you're running for Governor 
                        and going to be elected - my idea 
                        is how wonderful it would be if 
                        you don't run at all and don't get 
                        elected.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ONE OF THE EXITS - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT -

          Emily and Junior are standing, waiting for Kane.

                                    JUNIOR
                        Is Pop Governor yet, Mom?

          Just then, Kane appears, with Reilly and several other men.  
          Kane rushes toward Emily and Junior, as the men politely greet 
          Emily.

                                    KANE
                        Hello, Butch!  Did you like your 
                        old man's speech?

                                    JUNIOR
                        Hello, Pop!  I was in a box.  I 
                        could hear every word.

                                    KANE
                        I saw you!
                               (he has his arm 
                               around Junior's 
                               shoulder)
                        Good night, gentlemen.

          There are good nights.  Kane's car is at the curb and he starts 
          to walk toward it with Junior and Emily.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm sending Junior home in the
                        car, Charles - with Oliver -

                                    KANE
                        But I'd arranged to go home with 
                        you myself.

                                    EMILY
                        There's a call I want you to make 
                        with me, Charles.

                                    KANE
                        It can wait.

                                    EMILY
                        No, it can't.
                               (she bends down and 
                               kisses Junior)
                        Good night, darling.

                                    JUNIOR
                        Good night, Mom.

          The driver is holding the rear door open as Emily guides Junior 
          in.

                                    KANE
                               (as car starts to 
                               drive off)
                        What's this all about, Emily?  
                        I've had a very tiring day and -

                                    EMILY
                        It may not be about anything at 
                        all.

          A cab has pulled up.

                                    THE DRIVER
                        Cab?

          Emily nods to him.

                                    EMILY
                        I intend to find out.

                                    KANE
                        I insist on being told exactly 
                        what you have in mind.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm going to -
                               (she looks at a 
                               slip of paper in 
                               her hand)
                        - 185 West 74th Street.

          Kane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means 
          something to him.

                                    EMILY
                        If you wish, you can come with 
                        me...

          Kane nods.

                                    KANE
                        I'll go with you.

          He opens the door and she enters the cab.  He follows her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CAB - NIGHT -

          Kane and Emily.  He looks at her, in search of some kind of 
          enlightenment.  Her face is set and impassive.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. AND INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT -

          Kane and Emily, in front of an apartment door.  Emily is 
          pressing the bell.

                                    KANE
                        I had no idea you had this flair 
                        for melodrama, Emiliy.

          Emily does not answer.  The door is opened by a maid, who 
          recognizes Kane.

                                    THE MAID
                        Come in, Mr. Kane, come in.

          They enter, Emily first.

          INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT -

          There is first a tiny reception room, through which an open 
          door shows the living room.  Kane and Emily enter from the 
          hallway and cross to the living room.  As they enter, Susan 
          rises from a chair.  The other person  in the room - a big, 
          heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, 
          leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently.

                                    SUSAN
                        It wasn't my fault, Charlie.  He 
                        made me send your wife a note.
                        He said I'd - oh, he's been saying 
                        the most terrible things, I didn't
                        know what to do...  I -
                               (she catches sight 
                               of Emily)

                                    ROGERS
                        Good evening, Mr. Kane.
                               (he rises)
                        I don't suppose anybody would 
                        introduce us.  Mrs. Kane, I am 
                        Edward Rogers.

                                    EMILY
                        How do you do?
                               (pauses)
                        I came here - and I made Mr. Kane 
                        come with me...
                               (she consults the 
                               note in her hand 
                               without reading it 
                               again)
                        because I recieved this note -

                                    ROGERS
                        I made Miss - Miss Alexander send 
                        you the note.  She was a little
                        unwilling at first -
                               (he smiles grimly)
                        but she did it.

                                    SUSAN
                        I can't tell you the things he 
                        said, Charlie.  You haven't got
                        any idea -

                                    KANE
                               (turning on Rogers)
                        Rogers, I don't think I will 
                        postpone doing something about you 
                        until I'm elected.
                               (he starts toward 
                               him)
                        To start with, I'll break your 
                        neck.

                                    ROGERS
                               (not giving way an 
                               inch)
                        Maybe you can do it and maybe you 
                        can't, Mr. Kane.

                                    EMILY
                        Charles!
                               (he stops to look 
                               at her)
                        Your - your breaking this man's
                        neck -
                               (she is clearly 
                               disgusted)
                        would scarcely explain this note -
                               (glancing at the 
                               note)
                        Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -
                               (slowly)
                        for myself, and for my son.  What
                        does this note mean, Miss -

                                    SUSAN
                               (stiffly)
                        I'm Susan Alexander.
                               (pauses)
                        I know what you think, Mrs. Kane,
                        but -

                                    EMILY
                               (ignoring this)
                        What does this note mean, Miss 
                        Alexander?

                                    ROGERS
                        She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She 
                        just sent it - because I made her 
                        see it wouldn't be smart for her 
                        not to send it.

                                    KANE
                        In case you don't know, Emily,
                        this - this gentleman -
                               (he puts a world of 
                               scorn into the 
                               word)
                        is -

                                    ROGERS
                        I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, 
                        and your husband is just trying to 
                        be funny calling me one.  I don't 
                        even know what a gentleman is.
                               (tensely, with all 
                               the hatred and 
                               venom in the world)
                        You see, my idea of a gentleman, 
                        Mrs.  Kane - well, if I owned a 
                        newspaper and if I didn't like the 
                        way somebody else was doing things - 
                        some politican, say - I'd fight 
                        them with everything I had.  Only 
                        I wouldn't show him in a convict 
                        suit, with stripes - so his children 
                        could see the picture in the paper.  
                        Or his mother.
                               (he has to control 
                               himself from hurling 
                               himself at Kane)
                        It's pretty clear - I'm not a 
                        gentleman.

                                    EMILY
                        Oh!!

                                    KANE
                        You're a cheap, crooked grafter -
                        and your concern for your children
                        and your mother -

                                    ROGERS
                        Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only 
                        we're talking now about what you 
                        are.  That's what the note is about, 
                        Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay 
                        all my cards on the table.  I'm 
                        fighting for my life.  Not just my 
                        political life.  My life.  If your
                        husband is elected governor -

                                    KANE
                        I'm going to be elected governor.
                        And the first thing I'm going to
                        do -

                                    EMILY
                        Let him finish, Charles.

                                    ROGERS
                        I'm protecting myself every way I 
                        know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last 
                        week, I finally found out how I 
                        can stop your husband from being 
                        elected.  If the people of this 
                        state learn what I found out this 
                        week, he wouldn't have a chance to - 
                        he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  
                        Well, what I'm interested in is 
                        seeing that he's not elected.  I 
                        don't care whether they know what 
                        I know about him.  Let him keep 
                        right on being the Great, Noble, 
                        Moral -
                               (he stresses the 
                               world)
                        Champeen of the people.  Just as 
                        long as -

                                    EMILY
                        I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, 
                        but wonder if -
                               (she leaves her 
                               sentence unfinished)

                                    KANE
                        You can't blackmail me, Rogers, 
                        you can't -

                                    SUSAN
                               (excitedly)
                        Charlie, he said, unless you 
                        withdrew your name -

                                    ROGERS
                        That's the chance I'm willing to 
                        give you, Mr. Kane.  More of a 
                        chance than you'd give me.  Unless 
                        you make up your mind by tomorrow 
                        that you're so sick that you've 
                        got to go away for a year or two -
                        Monday morning every paper in this 
                        State will carry the story I'm 
                        going to give them.

          Kane starts to stare at him intently.

                                    EMILY
                        What story, Mr. Rogers?

                                    ROGERS
                        The story about him and Miss 
                        Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

          Emily looks at Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        There is no story.  It's all lies.
                        Mr. Kane is just -

                                    ROGERS
                               (to Susan)
                        Shut up!
                               (to Kane)
                        I've had a dozen men doing nothing 
                        but run this thing down - we've 
                        got evidence enough to - well, the 
                        evidence would stand up in any 
                        court of law.  You want me to give 
                        you the evidence, Mr. Kane?

                                    KANE
                        You do anything you want to do.
                        The people of this state can decide 
                        which one of us to trust.  If you 
                        want to know, they've already 
                        decided.  The election Tuesday'll 
                        be only -

                                    ROGERS
                        Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to
                        believe me.  I'd like to show you -

                                    EMILY
                        You don't have to show me anything, 
                        Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.

                                    ROGERS
                        I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without 
                        having to get the story published.
                        Not that I care about him.  But 
                        I'd be better off that way -
                               (he pauses)
                        - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        What about me?
                               (to Kane)
                        He said my name'd be dragged through 
                        the mud.  He said everywhere I'd 
                        go from now on -

                                    EMILY
                        There seems to be only one decision 
                        you can make, Charles.  I'd say 
                        that it has been made for you.
                               (pauses)
                        I suppose the details can be 
                        arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers.  
                        About the statements by the doctors -

                                    KANE
                        Have you gone completely mad, Emily?

          Emily looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        You don't think I'm going to let 
                        this blackmailer intimidate me, do 
                        you?

                                    EMILY
                        I don't see what else you can do, 
                        Charles.  If he's right - and the
                        papers publish this story he has -

                                    KANE
                        Oh, they'll publish it all right.
                        But that's not going to stop me -

                                    EMILY
                        Charles, this - this story - doesn't 
                        concern only you.  I'll be in it, 
                        too, won't I?
                               (quickly)
                        And Junior?

                                    KANE
                               (squirming a bit)
                        I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid 
                        of the story.  You can't tell me
                        that the voters of this state -

                                    EMILY
                        I'm not interested in the voters 
                        of this state right now.  I am 
                        interested in - well, Junior, for 
                        one thing.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie!  If they publish this
                        story -

                                    EMILY
                        They won't.  Goodnight, Mr. Rogers.
                               (she starts out)
                        There's nothing more to be said, 
                        Charles.

                                    KANE
                        Oh yes, there is.

                                    EMILY
                        I don't think so.  Are you coming, 
                        Charles?

                                    KANE
                        No.

          She looks at him.  He starts to work himself into a rage.

                                    KANE
                        There's only one person in the 
                        world to decide what I'm going to 
                        do - and that's me.  And if
                        you think - if any of you think -

                                    EMILY
                        You decided what you were going to 
                        do, Charles - some time ago.
                               (she looks at Susan)
                        You can't always have it your own 
                        way, regardless of anything else 
                        that may have happened.
                               (she sighs)
                        Come on, Charles.

                                    KANE
                        Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this 
                        thing all alone!

                                    ROGERS
                        You're making a bigger fool of 
                        yourself than I thought you would, 
                        Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why 
                        don't you -

                                    KANE
                               (turning on him)
                        Get out!  I've got nothing to talk 
                        to you about.  If you want to see 
                        me, have the Warden write me a 
                        letter.

                                    ROGERS
                        I see!
                               (he starts toward 
                               the door)

                                    SUSAN
                               (starting to cry)
                        Charlie, you're just excited.  You
                        don't realize -

                                    KANE
                        I know exactly what I'm doing.
                               (he is screaming)
                        Get out!

                                    EMILY
                               (quietly)
                        Charles, if you don't listen to
                        reason, it may be too late -

                                    KANE
                        Too late for what?  Too late for
                        you and this -
                               (he can't find the 
                               adjective)
                        this public thief to take the love 
                        of the people of this state away 
                        from me?  Well, you won't do it, I 
                        tell you.  You won't do it!

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie, there are other things to 
                        think of.
                               (a sly look comes 
                               into her eyes)
                        Your son - you don't want him to
                        read in the papers -

                                    EMILY
                        It is too late now, Charles.

                                    KANE
                               (rushes to the door 
                               and opens it)
                        Get out, both of you!

                                    SUSAN
                               (rushes to him)
                        Charlie, please don't -

                                    KANE
                        What are you waiting here for?
                        Why don't you go?

                                    EMILY
                        Goodnight, Charles.

          She walks out.  Rogers stops as he gets directly in front of 
          Kane.

                                    ROGERS
                        You're the greatest fool I've ever 
                        known, Kane.  If it was anybody 
                        else, I'd say what's going to happen 
                        to you would be a lesson to you.  
                        Only you're going to need more 
                        than one lesson.  And you're going 
                        to get more than one lesson.
                               (he walks past Kane)

                                    KANE
                        Don't you worry about me.  I'm 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, 
                        crooked politician, trying to save 
                        himself from the consequences of
                        his crimes -

          INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT -

          Camera angling toward Kane from other end of the hall.  Rogers 
          and Emily are already down the hall, moving toward foreground.  
          Kane in apartment doorway background.

                                    KANE
                               (screams louder)
                        I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, 
                        Rogers.  Sing Sing!

          Kane is trembling with rage as he shakes his fist at Rogers's 
          back.  Susan, quieter now, has snuggled into the hollow of his 
          shoulder as they stand in the doorway.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Digest") revealing Kane's relations with Susan.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -

          Emily is opening the door for Leland.

                                    EMILY
                        Hello, Brad -

                                    LELAND
                        Emily -

          He pauses.  Leland comes in.  Emily closes the door.

                                    EMILY
                        I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad -
                        didn't -

                                    LELAND
                        Chicago is pretty close to New
                        York nowadays - only twenty hours -

          She doesn't have anything to say.

                                    LELAND
                        I'm glad to see you.

          She smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in 
          the world for her to smile at.  She's too grateful to talk.

                                    EMILY
                        Are all the returns in?

          Leland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper.

                                    EMILY
                        Let me see it.

          Leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to 
          her.  She takes it.  We see the headline, not an insert, but 
          it registers.  It reads: "Fraud at Polls."  Emily is looking 
          at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile.

                                    LELAND
                               (after a pause)
                        Almost two to one -

                                    EMILY
                        I'm surprised he got the votes he 
                        did.

                                    LELAND
                        Emily!

                                    EMILY
                        Why should anyone vote for him?  
                        He's made it quite clear to the 
                        people what he thinks of them.
                        Children - to be told one thing 
                        one day, something else the next, 
                        as the whim seizes him.  And they're 
                        supposed to be grateful and love 
                        and adore him - because he sees to 
                        it that they get cheap ice and 
                        only pay a nickel in the street 
                        cars.

                        Emily, you're being - a little 
                        unfair -  You know what I think of 
                        Charles' behavior - about your
                        personal lives -

                                    EMILY
                        There aren't any personal lives 
                        for people like us.  He made that
                        very clear to me nine years ago -
                        If I'd thought of my life with
                        Charles as a personal life, I'd
                        have left him then -

                                    LELAND
                        know that, Emily -

                        Maybe I should have - the first 
                        time he showed me what a mad dog 
                        he really was.

                        It's - all over -

          He stops himself.

                        Know it is, Brad -

                        He's paying for it, Emily.  Those 
                        returns tonight - he's finished.
                        Politically -
                               (he thinks)
                        - socially, everywhere, I guess.
                        don't know about the papers, but -

                                    EMILY
                        If you're asking me to sympathize 
                        with him, Brad, you're wasting 
                        your time.
                               (pauses)
                        There's only one person I'm sorry
                        for, as a matter of fact.  That -
                        that shabby little girl.  I'm really

          Front page Chicago "Enquirer," with photograph proclaiming 
          that Susan Alexander opens at new Chicago Opera House in 
          "Thais," as in "News Digest."

          On soundtrack during above we hear the big, expectant murmur 
          of an opening night audience and the noodling of the orchestra.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - SET FOR "THAIS" -

          The camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage.  We 
          see the set for "Thais" - the principals in place - stage 
          managers, stage hands, etc., and in the center of all this, in 
          an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is 
          Susan.  She is almost hysterical with fright.  Maids, singing 
          teacher, and the rest are in attendance.  Her throat is sprayed.  
          Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the 
          orchestra starts thunderously.  The curtain starts to rise -
          the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up 
          Susan's body and hits her face.  She squints and starts to 
          sing.  Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, 
          up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into 
          the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging 
          canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly.  The camera 
          stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops.  Two 
          typical stage hands fill the frame.  They are looking down on 
          the stage below.  Some of the reflected light gleams on their 
          faces.  They look at each other.  One of them puts his hand to 
          his nose.

          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Leland, as in the same scene in the Bernstein sequence, is 
          sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys.  The 
          paper is gone from the roller.  Leland stirs and looks up 
          drunkenly, his eyes encountering Bernstein, who stands beside 
          him (also as in the previous scene).

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        Hello, Bernstein.

          Leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together.  He 
          straightens and reaches for the keys - then sees the paper is 
          gone from the machine.

                                    LELAND
                        Where is it - where's my notice?
                        I've got to finish it!

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (quietly)
                        Mr. Kane is finishing it.

                                    LELAND
                        Kane?  Charlie?
                               (painfully, he rises 
                               to his feet)
                        Where is he?

          During all this, the sound of a typewriter has been heard off - 
          a busy typewriter.  Leland's eyes follow the sound.  Slowly he 
          registers Kane in the City Room beyond.  This is almost the 
          same shot as in the previous Bernstein story.

          INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -

          Kane, in white tie and shirt sleeves, is typing away at a 
          machine, his fingers working briskly and efficiently, his face, 
          seen by the desk light before him, set in a strange half-smile.

          Leland stands in the door of his office, staring across at 
          him.

                                    LELAND
                        I suppose he's fixing it up - I 
                        know I'd never get that through.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                               (moving to his side)
                        Mr. Kane is finishing your piece 
                        the way you started it.

          Leland turns incredulously to Bernstein.

                                    BERNSTEIN
                        He's writing a roast like you wanted
                        it to be -
                               (then suddnely - 
                               with a kind of 
                               quiet passion rather 
                               than a triumph)
                        - I guess that'll show you.

          Leland picks his way across the City Room to Kane's side.  
          Kane goes on typing, without looking up.  After a pause, Kane 
          speaks.

                                    KANE
                        Hello, Brad.

                                    LELAND
                        Hello, Charlie -

                                    (ANOTHER PAUSE)
                        I didn't know we were speaking.

          Kane stops typing, but doesn't turn.

                                    KANE
                        Sure, we're speaking, Brad -
                        you're fired.

          He starts typing again, the expression on his face doesn't 
          change.

          Thompson and Leland on the roof, which is now deserted.  It is 
          getting late.  The sun has just about gone down.

                                    LELAND
                        Well, that's about all there is -
                        and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!
                               (pause)
                        Five years ago, he wrote from that
                        place of his down South -
                               (as if trying to 
                               think)
                        - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?
                               (pauses)
                        Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of 
                        that place?  You know...  All right.  
                        Xanadu.  I knew what it was all 
                        the time.  You caught on, didn't 
                        you?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Yes.

                                    LELAND
                        I guess maybe I'm not as hard to 
                        see through as I think.  Anyway, I 
                        never even answered his letter.
                        Maybe I should have.  I guess he 
                        was pretty lonely down there those 
                        last years.  He hadn't finished it 
                        when she left him - he never 
                        finished it - he never finished 
                        anything.  Of course, he built it 
                        for her -

                                    THOMPSON
                        That must have been love.

                                    LELAND
                        I don't know.  He was disappointed 
                        in the world.  So he built one of 
                        his own -  An absolute monarchy -
                        It was something bigger than an 
                        opera house anyway -

                        Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad 
                        to.

          A Nurse appears.

                        Hello, Mr. Leland.

                                    LELAND
                        I'm ready to go in now.  You know 
                        when I was a young man, there was 
                        an impression around that nurses 
                        were pretty.  It was no truer then
                        than it is now.

                                    NURSE
                        Here, let me take your arm, Mr. 
                        Leland.

                                    LELAND
                               (testily)
                        All right, all right.
                               (he has begun to 
                               move forward on 
                               the Nurse's arm; 
                               turning to Thompson)
                        You won't forget, will you, about 
                        the cigars?  And tell them to wrap 
                        them up to look like toothpaste, 
                        or something, or they'll stop them 
                        at the desk.  That young doctor I 
                        was telling you about, he's got an 
                        idea he wants to keep me alive.

          Very faintly during this, idle piano music playing.

          Susan and Thompson are facing each other.  The place is almost

                        thing - ask questions?

                                    THOMPSON
                        I'd rather you just talked.  
                        Anything that comes into your mind - 
                        about yourself and Mr. Kane.

                                    SUSAN
                        You wouldn't want to hear a lot of 
                        what comes into my mind about myself 
                        and Mr. Charlie Kane.

          Susan is thinking.

                                    THOMPSON
                        How did you meet him?

                                    SUSAN
                        I had a toothache.

          Thompson looks at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        That was thiry years ago - and I 
                        still remember that toothache.
                        Boy!  That toothache was just 
                        driving me crazy...

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          EXT. CORNER DRUG STORE AND STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEW YORK - 
          NIGHT -

          Susan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of 
          the period, is leaving the drug store.  It's about 8 o'clock 
          at night.  With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her 
          cheek, she is in considerable pain.  The street is wet - after 
          a recent rain.

          She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can 
          stand it no longer.  She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves 
          that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs 
          her gums.

          She walks on, the pain only a bit better.  Four or five houses 
          farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - 
          a shabby, old four-story apartment house.  She turns toward 
          the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps.

          As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost 
          bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her.  His shoulder 
          bumps hers and she turns.  As she does so, Kane, forced to 
          change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which 
          covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk.  The plank rises up and 
          cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud.

                                    KANE
                               (hopping up and 
                               down and rubbing 
                               his knee)
                        Ow!

          Susan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with 
          laughter.

                                    KANE
                        It's not funny.

          He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.  Susan tries to 
          control her laughter, but not very successfully.  Kane glares 
          at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm sorry, mister - but you do 
                        look awful funny.

          Suddenly, the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw.

                                    SUSAN
                        Ow!

                                    KANE
                        What's the matter with you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Toothache.

                                    KANE
                        Hmm!

          He has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief.

                                    SUSAN
                        You've got some on your face.

                                    KANE
                        If these sidewalks were kept in 
                        condition - instead of the money
                        going to some cheap grafter -

          Susan starts to laugh again.

                                    KANE
                        What's funny now?

                                    SUSAN
                        You are.  You look like you've 
                        been making mud pies.

          In the middle of her smile, the pain returns.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                    KANE
                        You're no Venus de Milo.

                                    SUSAN
                               (points to the 
                               downstair window)
                        If you want to come in and wash 
                        your face -  I can get you some 
                        hot water to get that dirt off
                        your trousers -

                                    KANE
                        Thanks.

          Susan starts, with Kane following her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -

          It's in moderate disorder.  The Mansbach gas lights are on.  
          It's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're 
          entitled to in 1910, for $5.00 a week including breakfast.

          There is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few 
          personal belongings on the chiffonier.  These include a 
          photograph of a gent and lady, obviously Susan's parents, and 
          a few objets d'art.  One, "At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game 
          at Coney Island," and - perhaps this is part of the Japanese 
          loot - the glass globe with the snow scene Kane was holding in 
          his hand in the first sequence.

          Susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over 
          her arm.  Kane is waiting for her.  She doesn't close the door.

                                    SUSAN
                               (by way of 
                               explanation)
                        My landlady prefers me to keep 
                        this door open when I have a 
                        gentleman caller.
                               (starts to put the 
                               basin down)
                        She's a very decent woman.
                               (making a face)
                        Ow!

          Kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the 
          chiffonier.  To do this, he has to shove the photograph to one 
          side of the basin.  Susan grabs the photograph as it is about 
          to fall over.

                                    SUSAN
                        Hey, you should be more careful.
                        That's my ma and pa.

                                    KANE
                        I'm sorry.  They live here, too?

                                    SUSAN
                        No.  They've passed on.

          Again she puts her hand to her jaw.

                                    KANE
                        Where's the soap?

                                    SUSAN
                        In the water.

          Kane fishes the soap out of the water.  It is slippery, however, 
          and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it 
          falls to the floor.  Susan laughs as he bends over.

                                    KANE
                               (starting to wash 
                               his hands)
                        You're very easily amused.

                                    SUSAN
                        I always like to see the funny 
                        side of things.  No sense crying 
                        when you don't have to.  And you're 
                        so funny.  Looking at you, I forget 
                        all about my toothache.

          Her face distorts in pain again.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh!

                                    KANE
                        I can't stay here all night chasing 
                        your pain away.

                                    SUSAN
                               (laughs)
                        I know...  But you do look so silly.

          Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot 
          open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.

                                    KANE
                        Where's the towel?

                                    SUSAN
                        On the chiffonier.  Here.

                                    KANE
                               (rubs his face dry)
                        Thanks.

                                    SUSAN
                               (on her way to closet)
                        I've got a brush in the closet.  
                        As soon as the mud on your trousers 
                        is all dry - you just brush it 
                        off.

                                    KANE
                        I'll get these streets fixed, if 
                        it's the last thing I do.

          Susan comes out of the closet.  She holds out the brush with 
          her left hand, her right hand to her jaw in real distress.

                                    KANE
                               (takes the brush)
                        You are in pain, aren't you, you 
                        poor kid?

          Susan can't stand it anymore and sits down in a chair, bent 
          over, whimpering a bit.

                                    KANE
                               (brushing himself)
                        Wish there was something I could -

          He stops and thinks.  Susan, her face averted, is still trying 
          hard not to cry.

                                    KANE
                        I've got an idea, young lady.
                               (there is no response)
                        Turn around and look at me.
                               (there is still no 
                               response)
                        I said, turn around and look at 
                        me, young lady.

          Slowly, Susan turns.

                                    KANE
                        Did you ever see anybody wiggle 
                        both his ears at the same time?

          It takes a second for Susan to adapt herself to this.

                                    KANE
                        Watch closely!
                               (he wiggles his 
                               ears)
                        It took me two solid years at the 
                        finest boys' school in the world 
                        to learn that trick.  The fellow 
                        who taught me is President of 
                        Venezuela now.

          He's still wiggling his ears as Susan starts to smile.

                                    KANE
                        That's it!  Smile!

          Susan smiles, very broadly.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -

          Closeup of a duck, camera pulls back showing it to be a 
          shadowgraph on the wall, made by Kane, who is now in his shirt 
          sleeves.  It is about an hour later than preceding sequence.

                                    SUSAN
                               (hesitatingly)
                        A chicken?

                                    KANE
                        No.  But you're close.

                                    SUSAN
                        A rooster?

                                    KANE
                        You're getting farther away all 
                        the time.  It's a duck.

                                    SUSAN
                        Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this 
                        takes a lot of nerve, but - who 
                        are you?  I mean - I'm pretty 
                        ignorant, guess you caught on to 
                        that -

                                    KANE
                               (looks squarely at 
                               her)
                        You really don't know who I am?

                                    SUSAN
                        No.  That is, I bet it turns out 
                        I've heard your name a million 
                        times, only you know how it is -

                                    KANE
                        But you like me, don't you?  Even 
                        though you don't know who I am?

                                    SUSAN
                        You've been wonderful!  I can't 
                        tell you how glad I am you're here, 
                        I don't know many people and -
                               (she stops)

                                    KANE
                        And I know too many people.  
                        Obviously, we're both lonely.
                               (he smiles)
                        Would you like to know where I was 
                        going tonight - when you ran into 
                        me and ruined my Sunday clothes?

                                    SUSAN
                        I didn't run into you and I bet 
                        they're not your Sunday clothes.
                        You've probably got a lot of 
                        clothes.

                                    KANE
                               (as if defending 
                               himself from a 
                               terrible onslaught)
                        I was only joking!
                               (pauses)
                        This evening I was on my way to
                        the Western Manhattan Warehouses -
                        in search of my youth.

          Susan is bewildered.

                                    KANE
                        You see, my mother died, too - a 
                        long time ago.  Her things were 
                        put into storage out west because 
                        I had no place to put them then.
                        I still haven't.  But now I've 
                        sent for them just the same.  And 
                        tonight I'd planned to make a sort 
                        of sentimental journey -
                               (slowly)
                        - to the scenes of my youth - my 
                        childhood, I suppose - to look 
                        again at -
                               (he changes mood 
                               slightly)
                        and now -

          Kane doesn't finish.  He looks at Susan.  Silence.

                                    KANE
                        Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles 
                        Foster Kane was born in New Salem,
                        Colorado in eighteen six -
                               (he stops on the 
                               word "sixty" - 
                               obviously a little 
                               embarrassed)
                        I run a couple of newspapers.  How 
                        about you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, me -

                                    KANE
                        How old did you say you were?

                                    SUSAN
                               (very bright)
                        I didn't say.

                                    KANE
                        I didn't think you did.  If you 
                        had, I wouldn't have asked you 
                        again, because I'd have remembered.
                        How old?

                                    SUSAN
                        Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in 
                        August.

                                    KANE
                               (looks at her 
                               silently for a 
                               moment)
                        That's a ripe old age -  What do 
                        you do?

                                    SUSAN
                        I work at Seligman's.

                                    KANE
                        Is that what you want to do?

                                    SUSAN
                        I want to be a singer.
                               (she thinks for a 
                               moment)
                        I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for 
                        me.

                                    KANE
                               (sympathetically)
                        What happened to the singing?
                        You're not in a show, are you?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother 
                        always thought - she used to talk 
                        about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine!
                        An American girl, for one thing -
                        and then my voice isn't really 
                        that kind anyway, it's just that 
                        Mother - you know what mothers are 
                        like.

          A sudden look comes over Kane's face.

                                    KANE
                        Yes -

                                    SUSAN
                        As a matter of fact, I do sing a 
                        little.

                                    KANE
                               (points to the piano)
                        Would you sing for me?

                                    SUSAN
                               (bashful)
                        Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me 
                        sing.

                                    KANE
                        Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, I -

                                    KANE
                        Don't tell me your toothache is 
                        bothering you again?

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, no, that's all gone.

                                    KANE
                        Then you have no alibi at all.
                        Please sing.

          Susan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and 
          sings a polite song.  Sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, 
          untrained voice.  Kane listens.  He is relaxed, at ease with 
          the world.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN -

          Susan tosses down a drink, then goes on with her story.

                                    SUSAN
                        I did a lot of singing after that.
                        I sang for Charlie -  I sang for 
                        teachers at a hundred bucks an 
                        hour - the teachers got that, I
                        didn't -

                                    THOMPSON
                        What did you get?

                                    SUSAN
                               (glares at him 
                               balefully)
                        What do you mean?

          Thompson doesn't answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        I didn't get a thing.  Just the 
                        music lessons.  That's all there 
                        was to it.

                                    THOMPSON
                        He married you, didn't he?

                                    SUSAN
                        He was in love with me.  But he 
                        never told me so until after it 
                        all came out in the papers about 
                        us - and he lost the election and
                        that Norton woman divorced him.

                                    THOMPSON
                        What about that apartment?

                                    SUSAN
                        He wanted me to be comfortable -
                        Oh, why should I bother?  You don't 
                        believe me, but it's true.  It 
                        just happens to be true.  He was 
                        really interested in my voice.
                               (sharply)
                        What are you smiling for?  What do 
                        you think he built that opera house 
                        for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't
                        want to sing.  It was his idea -
                        everything was his idea - except 
                        my leaving him.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. LIVING ROOM OF KANE'S HOUSE IN NEW YORK - DAY -

          Susan is singing.  Matisti, her voice teacher, is playing the 
          piano.  Kane is seated nearby.  Matisti stops.

                                    MATISTI
                        Impossible!  Impossible!

                                    KANE
                        Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane 
                        your opinion of her talents.
                        You're supposed to train her voice.
                        Nothing more.

                                    MATISTI
                               (sweating)
                        But, it is impossible.  I will be 
                        the laughingstock of the musical
                        world!  People will say -

                                    KANE
                        If you're interested in what people 
                        say, Signor Matisti, I may be able 
                        to enlighten you a bit.  The 
                        newspapers, for instance.  I'm an 
                        authority on what the papers will 
                        say, Signor Matisti, because I own 
                        eight of them between here and San 
                        Francisco...  It's all right, dear.
                        Signor Matisti is going to listen 
                        to reason.  Aren't you, maestro?
                               (he looks him square 
                               in the eyes)

                                    MATISTI
                        Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -

                                    KANE
                        You can't.

          There is a silence.  Matisti rises.

                                    KANE
                        I knew you'd see it my way.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT -

          It is the same opening night - it is the same moment as before - 
          except taht the camera is now upstage angling toward the 
          audience.  The curtain is down.  We see the same tableau as 
          before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive 
          principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.  
          As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause 
          (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, 
          the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the 
          music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly 
          alone.  The curtain rises.  The glare of the footlights jump 
          into the image.  The curtain is now out of the picture and 
          Susan starts to sing.  Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, 
          containing the anxious face of the prompter.  Beyond that, out 
          in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his 
          task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer.  
          Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms 
          for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness.

          Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening.

          Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice 
          from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of 
          thing that often happens in a theatre -

                                    THE VOICE
                        - really pathetic.

          Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but 
          hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as 
          Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume.

          Closeup of Susan's face - singing.

          Closeup of Kane's face - listening.

          There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding 
          as little as possible.  Kane still looks.  Then, near the 
          camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding 
          very, very loudly.  Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and 
          Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their 
          palms together.  The curtain is falling - as we can see by the 
          light which shutters down off their faces.

          The stage from Kane's angle.

          The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it.  Still, the 
          polite applause dying fast.  Nobody comes out for a bow.

          Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily.  Suddenly he starts to 
          applaud furiously.

          The stage from the audience again.

          Susan appears for her bow.  She can hardly walk.  There is a 
          little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly.

          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes 
          on Susan.

          The stage again.

          Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains.  The 
          light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on.

          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. STUDY - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - DAY -

          Some weeks later.  Susan, in a negligee, is at the window.  
          There are the remains of her breakfast tray on a little table.

                                    SUSAN
                        You don't propose to have yourself 
                        made ridiculous?  What about me?
                        I'm the one that has to do the 
                        singing.  I'm the one that gets 
                        the razzberries.
                               (pauses)
                        Last week, when I was shopping, 
                        one of the salesgirls did an 
                        imitation of me for another girl.  
                        She thought I didn't see her, but -  
                        Charlie, you might as well make up 
                        your mind to it.  This is one thing 
                        you're not going to have your own 
                        way about.  I can't sing and you 
                        know it -  Why can't you just -

          Kane rises and walks toward her.  There is cold menace in his 
          walk.  Susan shrinks a little as he draws closer to her.

                                    KANE
                        My reasons satisfy me, Susan.  You 
                        seem unable to understand them.  I 
                        will not tell them to you again.
                               (he is very close 
                               to her)
                        You will continue with your singing.

          His eyes are relentlessly upon her.  She sees something in 
          them that frightens her.  She nods her head slowly, indicating 
          surrender.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          Front page of the "San Francisco Enquirer" containing a large 
          portrait of Susan as Thais (as before).  It is announced that 
          Susan will open an independent season in San Francisco in 
          "Thais."  The picture remains constant but the names of the 
          papers change from New York to St. Louis, to Los Angeles to 
          Cleveland, to Denver to Philadelphia - all "Enquirers."

          During all this, on the soundtrack, Susan's voice is heard 
          singing her aria very faintly and far away, her voice cracking 
          a little.

          At the conclusion of this above, Susan has finished her song, 
          and there is the same mild applause as before - over the sound 
          of this, one man loudly applauding.  This fades out as we -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - LATE NIGHT -

          The camera angles across the bed and Susan's form towards the 
          door, from the other side of which voices can be heard.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Let's have your keys, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND'S VOICE
                        Yes, sir.

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        The key must be in the other side.
                               (pause)
                        We'll knock the door down, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND'S VOICE
                               (calling)
                        Mrs. Kane -

                                    KANE'S VOICE
                        Do what I say.

          The door crashes open, light floods in the room, revealing 
          Susan, fully dressed, stretched out on the bed, one arm dangling 
          over the side.  Kane rushes to her.

                                    KANE
                        Get Dr. Corey.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir.

          He rushes out.  Susan is breathing, but heavily.  Kane loosens 
          the lace collar at her throat.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT -

          A little later.  All the lights are lit.  Susan, in a nightgown, 
          is in bed, asleep.  Raymond and a nurse are just leaving the 
          room, Raymond closing the door quietly behind him.  Dr. Corey 
          rises.

                                    DR. COREY
                        She'll be perfectly all right in a 
                        day or two, Mr. Kane.

          Kane nods.  He has a small bottle in his hand.

                                    DR. COREY
                        The nurse has complete instructions, 
                        but if you care to talk to me at 
                        any time, I should be only too 
                        glad -  I shall be here in the 
                        morning.

                                    KANE
                        Thank you.  I can't imagine how 
                        Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly 
                        mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner 
                        gave her is in a somewhat larger 
                        bottle -  I suppose the strain of 
                        preparing for her trip has excited 
                        and confused her.

                                    DR. COREY
                        I'm sure that's it.
                               (he starts out)

                                    KANE
                        There are no objections to my 
                        staying here with her, are there?

                                    DR. COREY
                        Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to 
                        be here, too.

                                    KANE
                        Of course.

          Dr. Corey leaves.  Kane settles himself in a chair next to the 
          bed, looking at Susan.  In a moment, the nurse enters, goes to 
          a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - DAY -

          Susan, utterly spent, is lying flat on her back in her bed.  
          Kane is in the chair beside her.  The nurse is out of the room.

                                    SUSAN
                               (in a voice that 
                               comes from far 
                               away)
                        I couldn't make you see how I felt, 
                        Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I 
                        couldn't go threw with singing 
                        again.  You don't know what it 
                        means to feel - to know that people - 
                        that an audience don't want you.  
                        That if you haven't got what they 
                        want - a real voice -
                        they just don't care about you.  
                        Even when they're polite - and 
                        they don't laugh or get restless 
                        or - you know...  They don't want 
                        you.  They just -

                                    KANE
                               (angrily)
                        That's when you've got to fight 
                        them.  That's when you've got to 
                        make them.  That's -

          Susan's head turns and she looks at him silently with pathetic 
          eyes.

                                    KANE
                        I'm sorry.
                               (he leans over to 
                               pat her hand)
                        You won't have to fight them 
                        anymore.
                               (he smiles a little)
                        It's their loss.

          Gratefully, Susan, with difficulty, brings her other hand over 
          to cover his.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF XANADU - HALF BUILT

          INT. THE GRAND HALL IN XANADU -

          Closeup of an enormous jigsaw puzzle.  A hand is putting in 
          the last piece.  Camera moves back to reveal jigsaw puzzle 
          spread out on the floor.

          Susan is on the floor before her jigsaw puzzle.  Kane is in an 
          easy chair.  Behind them towers the massive Renaissance 
          fireplace.  It is night and Baroque candelabra illuminates the 
          scene.

                                    SUSAN
                               (with a sigh)
                        What time is it?

          There is no answer.

                                    SUSAN
                        Charlie!  I said, what time is it?

                                    KANE
                               (looks up - consults 
                               his watch)
                        Half past eleven.

                                    SUSAN
                        I mean in New York.

                        Half past eleven.

                        At night?

                                    KANE
                        Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to 
                        press.

                               (sighs)
                        Half past eleven!  The shows have 
                        just let out.  People are going to 
                        night clubs and restaurants.  Of 
                        course, we're different.  We live 
                        in a palace - at the end of the 
                        world.

                                    KANE
                        You always said you wanted to live 
                        in a palace.

                        Can't we go back, Charlie?

          Kane looks at her smilingly and turns back to his work.

          Another picture puzzle.

          Camera pulls back to show Kane and Susan in much the same 
          positions as before, except that they are older.

                                    KANE
                        One thing I've never been able to 
                        understand, Susan.  How do you 
                        know you haven't done them before?

          Susan shoots him an angry glance.  She isn't amused.

                                    SUSAN
                        It makes a whole lot more sense 
                        than collecting Venuses.

                        You may be right -  I sometimes 
                        wonder - but you get into the

                               (snapping)
                        It's not a habit.  I do it because 
                        I like it.

                                    KANE
                        I was referring to myself.
                               (pauses)
                        I thought we might have a picnic 
                        tomorrow - it might be a nice change 
                        after the Wild West party tonight.

                        Invite everybody!  Order everybody, 
                        you mean, and make them sleep in

                        when they have a nice room of their
                        own - with their own bath, where 
                        they know where everything is?

          Kane has looked at her steadily, not hostilely.

                                    KANE
                        I thought we might invite everybody 
                        to go on a picnic tomorrow.  Stay 
                        at Everglades overnight.
                               (he pats her lightly 
                               on the shoulder)
                        Please see that the arrangements 
                        are made, Susan.

          Kane turns away - to Bernstein.

                                    KANE
                        You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein.

          On the soundtrack we hear the following lines of dialogue:

                                    BERNSTEIN'S VOICE
                               (embarrased)
                        Oh, yes.  How do you do, Mr. Kane?

                                    CHARLIE JR.'S VOICE
                        Hello.

          During this, camera holds on closeup of Susan's face.  She is 
          very angry.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          EXT. THE EVERGLADES CAMP - NIGHT -

          Long shot - of a number of classy tents.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. LARGE TENT - EVERGLADES CAMP - NIGHT -

          Two real beds have been set up on each side of the tent.  A 
          rather classy dressing table is in the rear, at which Susan is 
          preparing for bed.  Kane, in his shirt-sleeves, is in an easy 
          chair, reading.  Susan is very sullen.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not going to put up with it.

          Kane turns to look at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        I mean it.
                               (she catches a slight 
                               flicker on Kane's 
                               face)
                        Oh, I know I always say I mean it, 
                        and then I don't - or you get me 
                        so don't do what I say I'm going 
                        to - but -

                                    KANE
                               (interrupting)
                        You're in a tent, darling.  You're 
                        not at home.  And I can hear you 
                        very well if you just talk in a 
                        normal tone of voice.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not going to have my guests
                        insulted, just because you think -
                               (in a rage)
                        - if people want to bring a drink 
                        or two along on a picnic, that's
                        their business.  You've got no 
                        right -

                                    KANE
                               (quickly)
                        I've got more than a right as far 
                        as you're concerned, Susan.

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, I'm sick and tired of you 
                        telling me what I must and what I 
                        musn't do!

                                    KANE
                               (gently)
                        You're my wife, Susan, and -

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm not just your wife, I'm a person 
                        all by myself - or I ought to be.  
                        I was once.  Sometimes you get me 
                        to believing I never was.

                                    KANE
                        We can discuss all this some other
                        time, Susan.  Right now -

                                    SUSAN
                        I'll discuss what's on my mind 
                        when I want to.  You're not going 
                        to keep on running my life the way 
                        you want it.

                                    KANE
                        As far as you're concerned, Susan, 
                        I've never wanted anything -  I 
                        don't want anything now - except 
                        what you want.

                                    SUSAN
                        What you want me to want, you mean.
                        What you've decided I ought to 
                        have - what you'd want if you were 
                        me.  But you've never given me 
                        anything that -

                                    KANE
                        Susan, I really think -

                                    SUSAN
                        Oh, I don't mean the things you've 
                        given me - that don't mean anything 
                        to you.  What's the difference 
                        between giving me a bracelet or 
                        giving somebody else a hundred 
                        thousand dollars for a statue you're 
                        going to keep crated up and never 
                        look at?  It's only money.  It 
                        doesn't mean anything.  You're not 
                        really giving anything that belongs 
                        to you, that you care about.

                                    KANE
                               (he has risen)
                        Susan, I want you to stop this.
                        And right now!

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, I'm not going to stop it.  
                        I'm going to say exactly what I 
                        think.
                               (she screams)
                        You've never given me anything.  
                        You've tried to buy me into giving 
                        you something.  You're -
                               (a sudden notion)
                        - it's like you were bribing me!  
                        That's what it's been from the 
                        first moment I met you.  No matter 
                        how much it cost you - your time, 
                        your money - that's what you've 
                        done with everybody you've ever 
                        known.  Tried to bribe them!

                                    KANE
                        Susan!

          She looks at him, with no lessening of her passion.

                                    KANE
                        You're talking an incredible amount 
                        of nonsense, Susan.
                               (quietly)
                        Whatever I do -  I do - because I 
                        love you.

                                    SUSAN
                        Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me 
                        or anybody else!  You want to be 
                        loved - that's all you want!  I'm 
                        Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you 
                        want - just name it and it's yours!
                        Only love me!  Don't expect me to
                        love you -

          Without a word, Kane slaps her across the face.  They look at 
          each other.

                                    SUSAN
                        You - you hit me.

          Kane continues to look at her.

                                    SUSAN
                        You'll never have another chance 
                        to hit me again.
                               (pauses)
                        Never knew till this minute -

                                    KANE
                        Susan, it seems to me -

                                    SUSAN
                        Don't tell me you're sorry.

                                    KANE
                        I'm not sorry.

                                    SUSAN
                        I'm going to leave you.

                                    KANE
                        No, you're not.

                                    SUSAN
                               (nods)
                        Yes.

          They look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way.  
          In fact, the camera on Kane's face shows the beginning of a 
          startled look, as of one who sees something unfamiliar and 
          unbelievable.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S STUDY - XANADU - DAY -

          Kane is a the window looking out.  He turns as he hears Raymond 
          enter.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Mrs. Kane would like to see you, 
                        Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        All right.

          Raymond waits as Kane hesitates.

                                    KANE
                        Is Mrs. Kane -
                               (he can't finish)

                                    RAYMOND
                        Marie has been packing since 
                        morning, Mr. Kane.

          Kane impetuously walks past him out of the room.

          INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - XANADU - DAY -

          Packed suitcases are on the floor, Susan is completely dressed 
          for travelling.  Kane bursts into the room.

                                    SUSAN
                        Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.  He 
                        can get the bags.

                                    MARIE
                        Yes, Mrs. Kane.

          She leaves.  Kane closes the door behind her.

                                    KANE
                        Have you gone completely crazy?

          Susan looks at him.

                                    KANE
                        Don't you realize that everybody 
                        here is going to know about this?
                        That you've packed your bags and
                        ordered the car and -

                                    SUSAN
                        - And left?  Of course they'll
                        hear.  I'm not saying goodbye -
                        except to you - but I never imagined 
                        that people wouldn't know.

          Kane is standing against the door as if physically barring her 
          way.

                                    KANE
                        I won't let you go.

                                    SUSAN
                        You can't stop me.

          Kane keeps looking at her.  Susan reaches out her hand.

                                    SUSAN
                        Goodbye, Charlie.

                                    KANE
                               (suddenly)
                        Don't go, Susan.

                                    SUSAN
                        Let's not start all over again, 
                        Charlie.  We've said everything 
                        that can be said.

                                    KANE
                        Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!

          He has lost all pride.  Susan stops.  She is affected by this.

                                    KANE
                        You mustn't go, Susan.  
                        Everything'll be exactly the way 
                        you want it.  Not the way I think 
                        you want it - by your way.  Please, 
                        Susan - Susan!

          She is staring at him.  She might weaken.

                                    KANE
                        Don't go, Susan!  You mustn't go!
                               (almost blubbering)
                        You - you can't do this to me,
                        Susan -

          It's as if he had thrown ice water into her face.  She freezes.

                                    SUSAN
                        I see - it's you that this is being 
                        done to!  It's not me at all.  Not 
                        how I feel.  Not what it means to 
                        me.
                               (she laughs)
                        I can't do this to you!
                               (she looks at him)
                        Oh, yes I can.

          She walks out, past Kane, who turns to watch her go, like a 
          very tired old man.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

          DISSOLVE IN:

          INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - NIGHT -

          Susan and Thompson at a table.  There is silence between them 
          for a moment.

                                    SUSAN
                        In case you've never heard of how 
                        I lost all my money - and it was
                        plenty, believe me -

                                    THOMPSON
                        The last ten years have been tough 
                        on a lot of people.

                                    SUSAN
                        They haven't been tough on me.  I 
                        just lost my money.  But when I 
                        compare these last ten years with
                        the twenty I spent with him -

                                    THOMPSON
                        I feel kind of sorry for him, all
                        the same -

                                    SUSAN
                               (harshly)
                        Don't you think I do?
                               (pause)
                        You say you're going down to Xanadu?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Monday, with some of the boys from 
                        the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants 
                        the whole place photographed 
                        carefully - all that art stuff.  
                        We run a picture magazine, you 
                        know -

                                    SUSAN
                        I know.  If you're smart, you'll 
                        talk to Raymond.  That's the butler.
                        You can learn a lot from him.  He 
                        knows where the bodies are buried.

          She shivers.  The dawn light from the skylight above has grown 
          brighter, making the artificial light in the night club look 
          particularly ghastly, revealing mercilessly every year of 
          Susan's age.

                                    SUSAN
                        Well, what do you know?  It's 
                        morning already.
                               (looks at him)
                        You must come around and tell me 
                        the story of your life sometime.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          An open door shows the pantry, which is dark.  Thompson and 
          Raymond are at a table.  There is a pitcher of beer and a plate 
          of sandwiches before them.  Raymond drinks a glass of beer and 
          settles back.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to 
                        handle the old man.  He was kind 
                        of queer, but I knew how to handle 
                        him.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Queer?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy 
                        those last years - he didn't have
                        much reason to be -

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CORRIDOR AND TELEGRAPH OFFICE - XANADU - NIGHT -

          Raymond walking rapidly along corridor.  He pushes open a door.  
          At a desk in a fairly elaborate telegraph office sits a wireless 
          operator named Fred.  Near him at a telephone switchboard sits 
          a female operator named Katherine (not that it matters).

                                    RAYMOND
                               (reading)
                        Mr. Charles Foster Kane announced 
                        today that Mrs. Charles Foster 
                        Kane has left Xanadu, his Florida 
                        home, under the terms of a peaceful 
                        and friendly agreement with the 
                        intention of filing suit for divorce 
                        at an early date.  Mrs. Kane said 
                        that she does not intend to return 
                        to the operatic career which she 
                        gave up a few years after her 
                        marriage, at Mr.  Kane's request.  
                        Signed, Charles Foster Kane.

          Fred finishes typing and then looks up.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Exclusive for immediate 
                        transmission.  Urgent priority all 
                        Kane papers.

                                    FRED
                        Okay.

          There is the sound of the buzzer on the switchboard.  Katherine 
          puts in a plug and answers the call.

                                    KATHERINE
                        Yes ... yes...  Mrs. Tinsdall -
                        Very well.
                               (turns to Raymond)
                        It's the housekeeper.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes?

                                    KATHERINE
                        She says there's some sort of 
                        disturbance up in Mrs. Alexander's 
                        room.  She's afraid to go in.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU - NIGHT -

          The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near 
          the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.  From inside 
          can be heard a terrible banging and crashing.  Raymond hurries 
          into scene, opens the door and goes in.

          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

          Kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is 
          literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures, hooks and 
          all off the wall, smashing them to bits - ugly, gaudy pictures - 
          Susie's pictures in Susie's bad taste.  Off of occasional 
          tables, bureaus, he sweeps Susie's whorish accumulation of 
          bric-a-brac.

          Raymond stands in the doorway watching him.  Kane says nothing.  
          He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, 
          still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits.  The curtains (too 
          frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single 
          gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads 
          of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and 
          dashes it across the room.  Finally he stops.  Susie's cozy 
          little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him.

          He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights 
          on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice.  
          Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with 
          the snowstorm in it.  He yanks it down.  Something made of 
          china breaks, but not the glass ball.  It bounces on the carpet 
          and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry.  His eye follows 
          it.  He stoops to pick it up - can't make it.  Raymond picks 
          it up for him; hands it to him.  Kane takes it sheepishly - 
          looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the corridor.

          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -

          Kane comes out of the door.  Mrs. Tinsdall has been joined now 
          by a fairly sizable turnout of servants.  They move back away 
          from Kane, staring at him.  Raymond is in the doorway behind 
          Kane.  Kane looks at the glass ball.

                                    KANE
                               (without turning)
                        Close the door, Raymond.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir.
                               (he closes it)

                                    KANE
                        Lock it - and keep it locked.

          Raymond locks the door and comes to his side.  There is a long 
          pause - servants staring in silence.  Kane gives the glass 
          ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.

                                    KANE
                        Raymond -
                               (he is almost in a 
                               trance)

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, sir -

          One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up.  Kane 
          shakes the ball again.  Another flurry of snow.  He watches 
          the flakes settle - then looks up.  Finally, taking in the 
          pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the 
          glass ball in his coat pocket.  He speaks very quietly to 
          Raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself.

                                    KANE
                        Keep it locked.

          He slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way 
          to let him pass, and watching him as he goes.  He is an old, 
          old man!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S CHAPEL - XANADU - LATE AFTERNOON -

          As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across 
          the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and 
          mother - (marked: James Kane - 18- TO 19-; Mary Kane - 18- TO 
          19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of 
          Kane's son.  A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes 
          are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt.  
          Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on.  The men strain 
          and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor.  The men now 
          place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words:

          CHARLES FOSTER KANE II.

          1907 - 1938

                                    ONE OF THE WORKMEN
                        Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able
                        to cement it till tommorrow.  We -

          Kane looks right through him.  Raymond cuts him short.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Okay.

          The men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel.  Kane 
          raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall.  It is 
          a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank 
          place which will be occupied by Kane himself.

                                    KANE
                        Do you like poetry, Raymond?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Can't say, sir.

                                    KANE
                        Mrs. Kane liked poetry -

          Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone 
          indeed - not to say off his trolley.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Not my wife - not either of them.

          He looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked 
          "MARY KANE."

                                    RAYMOND
                               (catching on)
                        Oh, yes, sir.

                                    KANE
                               (looking back up at 
                               the wall)
                        Do you know what that is?

                                    RAYMOND
                               (more his keeper 
                               than his butler 
                               now)
                        It's a wall you bought in China, 
                        Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        Persia.  It belonged to a king.

                                    RAYMOND
                        How did you get him to part with 
                        it, Mr. Kane?

                                    KANE
                        He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do 
                        you know what it means?

                                    RAYMOND
                        No, I don't, Mr. Kane.

                                    KANE
                        I didn't used to be afraid of it.

          A short pause.  His eyes still on the wall, but looking through 
          it, Kane quotes the translation.

                                    KANE
                        The drunkeness of youth has passed 
                        like a fever, And yet I saw many 
                        things, Seeing my glory in the 
                        days of my glory, I thought my 
                        power eternal And the days of my 
                        life Fixed surely in the years But 
                        a whisper came to me From Him who 
                        dies not.  I called my tributary 
                        kings together And those who were 
                        proud rulers under me, I opened 
                        the boxes of my treasure to them, 
                        saying: "Take hills of gold, 
                        moutains of silver, And give me 
                        only one more day upon the earth."
                        But they stood silent, Looking 
                        upon the ground; So that I died 
                        And Death came to sit upon my 
                        throne.  O sons of men You see a 
                        stranger upon the road, You call 
                        to him and he does not step.  He 
                        is your life Walking towards time, 
                        Hurrying to meet the kings of India 
                        and China.
                               (quoting)
                        O sons of men You are caught in 
                        the web of the world And the spider 
                        Nothing waits behind it.  Where 
                        are the men with towering hopes?
                        They have changed places with owls, 
                        Owls who have lived in tombs And 
                        now inhabit a palace.

          Kane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it.  
          Raymond looks at him.

          INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          Thompson and Raymond.  Raymond has finished his beer.

                                    RAYMOND
                               (callously)
                        That's the whole works, right up 
                        to date.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

                                    RAYMOND
                        Yes and no.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (getting to his 
                               feet)
                        Well, thanks a lot.

                                    RAYMOND
                        See what I mean?  He was a little 
                        gone in the head - the last couple 
                        of years, anyway - but I knew how 
                        to handle him.
                               (rises)
                        That "Rosebud" - that don't mean 
                        anything.  I heard him say it.
                        He just said "Rosebud" and then he 
                        dropped that glass ball and it 
                        broke on the floor.  He didn't say 
                        anything about that, so I knew he 
                        was dead - He said all kind of 
                        things I couldn't make out.  But I 
                        knew how to take care of him.

          Thompson doesn't answer.

                                    RAYMOND
                        You can go on asking questions if 
                        you want to.

                                    THOMPSON
                               (coldly)
                        We're leaving tonight.  As soon as 
                        they're through photographing
                        the stuff -

          Thompson has risen.  Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the 
          door, opening it for him.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Allow yourself plenty of time.  
                        The train stops at the Junction On 
                        signal - but they don't like to 
                        wait.  Not now.  I can remember 
                        when they'd wait all day ... if 
                        Mr. Kane said so.

          Raymond ushes Thompson into

          INT. THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

          The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, 
          but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, 
          some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and 
          small, are piled pell mell all over the place.  Furniture, 
          statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous 
          value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair 
          and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same 
          story.  Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows 
          of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, 
          rustling the papers.

          In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant 
          are busy photographing the sundry objects.  The floor is 
          littered with burnt-out flash bulbs.  They continue their work 
          throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a 
          flash bulb goes off.  In addition to the Photographer and his 
          Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second 
          and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and 
          Raymond.

          The Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing 
          somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph.  
          A flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer has just photographed 
          a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive.  
          The Assistant consults a label on the back of it.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        NO. 9182

          The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        "Nativity" - attributed to 
                        Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, 
                        cost 45,000 lira.  Got that?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Yeah.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        All right!  Next!  Better get that 
                        statue over there.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        Okay.

          The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their 
          equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the 
          hall.

                                    RAYMOND
                        What do you think all that is worth, 
                        Mr. Thompson?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Millions - if anybody wants it.

                                    RAYMOND
                        The banks are out of luck, eh?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear 
                        all right.

                                    ASSISTANT
                        "Venus," Fourth Century.  Acquired 
                        1911.  Cost twenty-three thousand.
                        Got it?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Okay.

                                    ASSISTANT
                               (patting the statue 
                               on the fanny)
                        That's a lot of money to pay for a 
                        dame without a head.

                                    SECOND ASSISTANT
                               (reading a label)

                        of Mary Kane, Little Salem,

                        Okay.

          A flashlight bulb goes off.

                                    SECOND ASSISTANT
                        We're all set to get everything.  
                        The junk as well as the art.

          Thompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful 
          of little pieces of cardboard.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        What's that?

                                    RAYMOND
                        It's a jigsaw puzzle.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        We got a lot of those.  There's a 
                        Burmese Temple and three Spanish 
                        ceilings down the hall.

          Raymond laughs.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Yeah, all in crates.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        There's a part of a Scotch castle 
                        over there, but we haven't bothered 
                        to unwrap it.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        I wonder how they put all those 
                        pieces together?

                                    ASSISTANT
                               (reading a label)
                        Iron stove.  Estate of Mary Kane.
                        Value $2.00.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Put it over by that statue.  It'll 
                        make a good setup.

                                    GIRL
                               (calling out)
                        Who is she anyway?

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Venus.  She always is.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        He sure liked to collect things, 
                        didn't he?

                                    RAYMOND
                        He went right on buying - right up 
                        to the end.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Anything and everything - he was a 
                        regular crow.

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                        wonder -  You put all this together -
                        the palaces and the paintings and 
                        the toys and everything - what 
                        would it spell?

          Thompson has turned around.  He is facing the camera for the 
          first time.

                                    THOMPSON
                        Charles Foster Kane.

          Another flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer turns to Thompson 
          with a grin.

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?

                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
                               (to the dancers)
                        Turn that thing off, will you?  
                        It's driving me nuts!  What's 
                        Rosebud?

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Kane's last words, aren't they, 
                        Jerry?
                               (to the Third 
                               Newspaperman)
                        That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, 
                        Jerry?  Did you ever find out what 
                        it means, Jerry?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No, I didn't.

          The music has stopped.  The dancers have come over to Thompson.

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Say, what did you find out about 
                        him, anyway, Jerry?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Not much.

                                    SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Well, what have you been doing?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Playing with a jigsaw puzzle -   I 
                        talked to a lot of people who knew 
                        him.

                                    GIRL
                        What do they say?

                                    THOMPSON
                        Well - it's become a very clear 
                        picture.  He was the most honest 
                        man who ever lived, with a streak 
                        of crookedness a yard wide.  He 
                        was a liberal and a reactionary; 
                        he was tolerant - "Live and Let 
                        Live" - that was his motto.  But 
                        he had no use for anybody who 
                        disagreed with him on any point, 
                        no matter how small it was.  He 
                        was a loving husband and a good 
                        father - and both his wives left 
                        him and his son got himself killed 
                        about as shabbily as you can do 
                        it.  He had a gift for friendship 
                        such as few men have - he broke 
                        his oldest friend's heart like 
                        you'd throw away a cigarette
                        you were through with.  Outside of 
                        that -

                        Okay, okay.

                                    GIRL
                        What about Rosebud?  Don't you 
                        think that explains anything?

                                    THOMPSON
                        No, I don't.  Not much anway.  
                        Charles Foster Kane was a man who 
                        got everything he wanted, and then 
                        lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was 
                        something he couldn't get or lost.  
                        No, I don't think it explains
                        anything.  I don't think any word 
                        explains a man's life.  No -  I 
                        guess Rosebud is just a piece in a 
                        jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.

          He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his 
          watch.

                                    THOMPSON
                        We'd better get along.  We'll miss 
                        the train.

          He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little 
          sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher 
          with at the opening of the picture.  Camera doesn't close in 
          on this.  It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, 
          picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great 
          hall.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. CELLAR - XANADU - NIGHT -

          A large furnace, with an open door, dominates the scene.  Two 
          laborers, with shovels, are shovelling things into the furnace.  
          Raymond is about ten feet away.

                                    RAYMOND
                        Throw that junk in, too.

          Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated.  It is mostly 
          bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc.  The sled is on 
          top of the pile.  As camera comes close, it shows the faded 
          rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the 
          word "ROSEBUD" across it.  The laborer drops his shovel, takes 
          the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace.  The flames 
          start to devour it.

          EXT. XANADU - NIGHT -

          No lights are to be seen.  Smoke is coming from a chimney.

          Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the 
          picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages.  It moves finally 
          through the gates, which close behind it.  As camera pauses 
          for a moment, the letter "K" is prominent in the moonlight.

          Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture 
          the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing.  On the fence 
          is a sign which reads:

          "PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING"

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                     THE END
COLOR OF NIGHT

          Credits start on a black screen, then they continue during the
          whole scene at Michelle's place, and they end at the beginning of
          the scene at Bill Capa's office.
                         
          MICHELLE'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Close-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical
          box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see
          Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the
          mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and
          her face shows that she is quite disturbed.
           Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various
          useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors.
           She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not
          finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which
          she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her
          dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away
          hurriedly from the mad Michelle.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           God !...... No !......
                         
          Michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She
          takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her
          teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in
          the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed.
           She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put
          it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the
          revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to
          kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while
          she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way.
                         
          BILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Large planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them,
          some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more
          understandable...
                         
                          BILL'S VOICE
           So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a
           specific answer...
                         
          ... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green
          suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed.
           The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-
          York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves
          with leather-bound books.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower
           of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real
           pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points
           straight down to Hell, where you belongs !...
                         
          During this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is
          seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no
          jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence.
                         
                          BILL
           OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and
           swoop down to finish me off.
          He stands up.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You
           think that everything got to be either black or white
           because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He
           knows I'm not like you
                         
                          BILL
           Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           We all do what ?
                         
                          BILL
           Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a
           keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have
           to fill in the blanks. We invent things.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           I don't know what you mean.
                         
                          BILL
           You invent enemies to test your strength against. You
           invent gods to protect you from these enemies.
                         
                          MICHELLE
          Cutting him.
           What a depressing view of life you have, that is such
           horse-shit !
                         
                          BILL
           Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next
           moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder
           who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember
           and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?
                         
                          MICHELLE
           No, why don't you tell me
                         
                          BILL
           Take a look in the mirror, Michelle
                         
                          MICHELLE
           Which mirror ?... This mirror ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Any mirror. Tell me what you see.
                         
                          MICHELLE
          We see Michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror.
           I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there
           is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the
           view outside actually...
                         
          During this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with
          something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward
          her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her
          from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells
          «Michelle» twice.
                         
          A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office
          must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A
          police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if
          the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from
          underneath, with the blood flowing around it.
                         
                          SEVERAL VOICES
           All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your
           car... Stop it...
                         
          BILL CAPA'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window,
          and look outside.
                         
                          BILL
          Voice over.
           My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around
           her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...
                         
          OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head. He
          finishes the preceding reply.
                          BILL
           Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from
           Hell. And then the red started to fade away.
                         
          The ophthalmologist moves the device away. We see Bill's face, and
          behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of
          colored spots close together. The red spots start to blink and
          then they become grey.
                         
          LARRY'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          It is the apartment of an old New-York intellectual. A bit messy.
          A old Earth globe on a stand. Objects and books everywhere, but
          with an warm atmosphere. Larry wears an open shirt and a sweater.
          Bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. At the
          beginning of the scene, Bill is lying on a couch.
                         
                          LARRY
           Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.
                         
          Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading. It is the New York
          Post. On the front page, a title in large prints : «Patient's
          family sues Manhattan shrink»
                         
                          BILL
           Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I
           don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.
                         
                          BILL
           Starts to stand up.
           Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a
           bitch.
                         
                          LARRY
           Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.
          Bill laughs.
           Do you really believe that you're responsible for her
           illness. You were a small recent part of her life.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking
           glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that
           easily.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with
           anyone else ?
                         
          Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. Bill is seated
          on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey
          cat who is lying on the table.
                         
                          BILL
           No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be
           romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of
           them want to love me
                          LARRY
           Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage
           once.
                         
                          BILL
           She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody
           else to death.
                         
                          LARRY
           Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to
           deny emotion.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh yeah !
                         
                          LARRY
           As you know, that could be very dangerous.
                         
          Bill stands up.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got
           something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get
           fixed.
                         
          He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on.
                         
                          LARRY
           You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man
           like you to forgive himself.
                         
                          BILL
           I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.
                         
          During the two last replies, Bill has walked to the front door.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't run away because of one treatment failure.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los
           Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up
           here, isn't it...
          He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it.
           Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.

           seated until the aircraft comes...
                         
          The end of the sentence is not understandable, because it is mixed
          with the sound of a radio set in a car.
                         
           VOICE IN THE RADIO
           Just another Monday in paradise. There is a fender-bender
           on 405, slowing thing down.
                         
          TAXI IN A TRAFFIC JAM - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver.
          He wears a French cap and a striped shirt. He has a strong foreign
          accent, which makes his sentences a bit hard to understand. Bill
          is seated at the back of the taxi. He is wearing a black polo
          shirt, jeans and sunglasses.
                         
                          TAXI DRIVER
           Hey ! Jerk-off ! What are you looking at ! There's an
           accident !...
          Short shot of the accident.
           ... Hey ! What happened ? Anybody is hurt ? Anybody is dead ?
          Car horns. A car bumps into the back of the taxi. Bill moves
          forward and backward, and then massages the back of his head.
           What are you doing ? You 're looking there and driving
           here ? Put the pedal on the metal... Asshole !
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Bob's office is located in a big modern building in downtown L.A.
          A wide sitting room, called «Group Room» is reserved for group
          therapy sessions. Furniture is modern and functional, but with a
          little personal touch.
           Close-up of a woman's hand, who steals a lighter on a table. Then
          we see Sondra putting covertly the lighter in her purse. She is
          dressed in a very elegant way, and wears expensive jewels. Richie,
          a teenagers with a large checkered floating shirt, a sleeveless
          denim jacket and walkman earphones on his head, walks behind her
          without looking at her, and gets seated in an armchair. We hear
          voices, but we understand only a few words here and there. Then a
          voice becomes clearer than the other ones. It is Clark's voice
          counting the books on a shelf.

           Is the aquarium with it ?... That's a blue shark... OK... Was
           that an after-schock I felt ?...
                         
                          CLARK
          He is dressed with a very neat grey suit. Everything on him is
          neat : not a hair going the wrong way.
           33 and 3 is... 44... 45
                         
                          CASEY
          He is seated on an armchair shaped like a giant hand. He looks ver
          «artist». He wears his hair tied in a ponytail. He is making fun
          of Clark.

                          BUCK
          He looks very rough, with his uncombed grey hair. He wears a red
          sweater without shirt, and a jacket.
           Leave him alone, will you ?

           No !
                         
                          BUCK
          He take off his jacket.
           I was just wondering how many fucking pages it had !
          Casey laughs.
                         
                          CLARK
           Oh Christ ! I fell right into that !
                         
          We see Bob behind the glass on the door of the room. He wears a
          shirt and a necktie, but no jacket. He looks pensively at the
          group.

           I don't get it.

           I do too.
                         
                          CASEY
           I don't care.

           Why not ?
                         
                          BUCK
           Because his father's paying for his therapy.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my dead husband is paying for mine, and I still care.
                         
          Casey is looking for his lighter. We see Sondra taping her chin
          with the lighter, then giving it back to Casey.
                         
                          CASEY
           Unbelievable !...
          Bob enters the room.
                         
                          BOB
           I think we should get started now... Clark...
                         
          He closes the door. We hear Bill's voice.
                         
                          BILL
           Hey Bob !

          Bob jumps nervously, then walks in the corridor toward Bill. They
          hug each other.
                         
                          BOB
           How you doing ? You look great.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm good...

           I' sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic on the freeway.
                         
                          BOB
           Listen... We're just about to get started.
                         
                          BILL
           You know. I'll just wait out here for a while.
                         
                          BOB
           Why don't you join us ?
                         
                          BILL
           Oh no... Listen... I's the last thing I need right now...
                         
                          BOB
           I'm serious... I could use a second look.

           No, Bob... Not tonight...
                         
          Bob drags him by the sleeve and pushes him into the meeting room.

           This is my friend, and colleague, Bill Capa, from New-York.
           Why don't you sit down over there, Bill...
          He sits next to Clark, who stands up to give him room.
           ... I thought it might be interesting for you, and for him,
           if he sat in one of our session.

                          BOB
           Why don't we begin by introducing ourselves and then saying
           as much or as little about why we are here as we are
           confortable with...
                         
          The secretary closes the door behind Bob's back, who remains
          seated and only turns his head slightly.

           Sondra ! Sondra, whey don't you start us off ?
                          SONDRA
          She simpers a lot and makes strange faces while she talks.
           OK... My name is Sondra Dorio... and... I always marry older men
           but...
          Richie looks at Bill's feet. Bill is wearing a red sock and a
          green sock, which makes Richie smile.
           ... I am single now... and I keep... I... I want sex all the time...
          Clark looks embarrassed. Casey sneers.
           But I mean... I really do... want... a real relationship... and...
           sometimes, I steal thing... I mean, they're little thing...
          Richie put his walkman earphones back on his ears.
           ... It doesn't make any sense. It's hard to... You know, I... Is
           that OK !

           Richie !
                         
          Richie doesn't hear a thing because of his earphones.
                         
                          BUCK
          Yelling louder.
           Richie !
                         
          He signals him to take off his earphones. Richie takes them off.
                         
                          RICHIE
           What !
                         
                          BOB
           Would you like to tell Bill a little something about
           yourself ?
                         
                          RICHIE
           No !
                         
                          CLARK
           OK... If nobody else is going to do it, I will. Richie has a
           gender identity problem, and social phobia, and he's
           promised the group no to wear the walkman in this group.
                         
                          BUCK
           Doctor Clark, to lay the inventory on. I like that.

           Saint Michael, sir.
                          CLARK
           This is not about you.
                         
                          BUCK
           You're right...
                         
                          BOB
           You know what I am saying ?...
          He talks to Richie.
                         
                          RICHIE
          One feels he has elocution problems. He stutters and looks for his
          words.
           I... I... I op... open my mouth to talk, but nothing... happens...
           except when I... when I do drugs. I... I can't... can't talk... so
           that's... how come I'm here... They... they say that I... I... that I
           blush too.
                         
                          CASEY
          Imitating him.
           Y-You c... can say that again...
                         
          Richie jumps on Casey. Sondra stands up to stop him, but she is
          toot late. Richie falls on Casey and knocks his armchair down.
                         
                          RICHIE
           Fuck you !... Fuck you !... I'll tear your fuckin' head off !
           You fuckin' cocksucker !
                         
                          BUCK
           Get up!
                         
          They fight on the floor. Buck tries to take them apart. He
          succeeds in tearing Richie away by holding him with both arms, and
          carrying him away.
                         
                          RICHIE
           Get the fuck off me !
                         
                          BOB
           Buck.
                         
          Richie gets free and walks rapidly out of the room. Sondra tries
          to follow him. Bob stops her.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Richie !
                         
                          BOB
           It's all right... He'll come back...
                         
                          BUCK
          Voice over.
           What do you think, Doctor Clark ?...
                         
          Bob straightens up the armchair and Casey stands up sneering.
                         
                          CASEY
           Was it something I said ?
                          SONDRA
           You are an asshole !
                         
                          BOB
           You know, guys... A little humanity...
                         
                          BUCK
          Talking to Bill.
           Funny... Oh, fucking laugh !...We're entertaining the shit out
           of you, aren't we ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone.
                         
                          BUCK
           Would you stop wound-licking, Sondra.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She seems a bit shocked.
           Oh ! That's very nice !
                         
                          BOB
           Buck ?
                         
                          BUCK
           I lost my wife... and daughter... And it just can't seem to
           pass... All right ?
                         
                          BILL
           Very sorry. How did they die ?
                         
                          BUCK
           They say...
          He starts crying.
           ... I... I can't talk about it...
                         
          Sondra turns her head away : she looks disturbed and moved. Clark
          wipes his eyes.
                         
                          BOB
           Casey ?
                         
                          CASEY
          He talks in articulating his words in an affected manner.
           I am Casey Heinz. I am a painter. I live in a loft
           downtown, and I guess... you could say... I'm alienated...
          At the end of his reply, he seems to be ready to cry. He puts his
          head in his hands, then shows his laughing face.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Can't you ever be serious ?...
                         
                          BUCK
           Does a bear poop in the woods ? I sit next to Clark
                         
          He moves to sit behind Clark. He lights a cigarette.
                         
                          CLARK
           And then smoke up a storm. My name is Clark. I'm a lawyer.
           And I... I have a compulsive obsessive disorder.
                         
                          CASEY
           So what's the problem ?
          He sneers.
                         
                          CLARK
           The problem is that if you and Buck are going to smoke in
           here, then the door to Doctor Moore's office must remain
           opened in minimum of fifteen inches.
                         
          Buck comes and sits next to Casey. They smoke together.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I can't stand smoke... OK ?
                         
          Buck and Casey puff clouds of smoke.
                         
                          CLARK
           And I would also like to suggest that you buy one of those
           ashtrays...
                         
                          SONDRA
           How come you don't listen to Clark ? How come you don't do
           anything about this, Bob ?
                         
                          CLARK
           ... that sucks up the smoke and purifies it. They cost nine
           dollars and ninety-nine cents, half of which is four-
           ninety-nine point five.
                         
                          CASEY
                         HE LAUGHS
           He's going to open the door.
                         
                          CLARK
           One of you will have to pay an extra penny, but I'm sure
           you can work that out.
                          CASEY
           He's going to open the door.
                         
                          CLARK
           I'm going to open the door.
                         
          General laugh. Several incomprehensible words. We understand only
          Sondra's next reply.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You smell like an ashtray.
                         
                          CLARK
           You know, if you don't act more seriously in groups.
                         
          Richie enters the room.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Hi, Richie !
                         
                          BUCK
           He's back.
                         
                          CASEY
           He's back.
                         
                          BUCK
           Next time you get snot on the doorknob...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Come sit down here.
                         
                          BOB
           Bill... What would you like to tell us about yourself ?
                         
          Richie walks behind Bill to reach his seat.
                         
                          BILL
           Well... I have plenty of problems... the biggest of which right
           now is jet-lag. So I think I'll pass for now, Bob.
                         
                          BOB
           Fair enough...
                         
          BOB' OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The end of the preceding scene fades in the beginning of this one.
          We are now later in the same day. Night has come. The atmosphere
          seems more relax. Buck is half lying on a sofa. Sondra is
          finishing her story with a sweet voice, and does not simper
          anymore.
                         
                          SONDRA
           ...She's like a daughter to me... We hang out... Meaning that...
           It's wonderful...
                         
                          BOB
          He looks at this watch.
           Well, that's all for tonight. I'll see you all next week...
                          BUCK
           Way to go.
                         
          Bob gets up very quickly. Everyone does like him, but more slowly.
          Bob turns back before he leaves the room.
                         
                          BOB
           Bill... I'll be with you in a couple of minutes.
          Bill nods in agreement.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Bye...
                         
                          BUCK
           Coffee, anyone?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah.
                         
                          CLARK
          He whispers.
           Nine.
                         
          Bill remains seated and nods to the people getting out. Clark
          remains, behind Bill, in front of the shelves. He puts something
          back in a plastic bag and mumbles something we don't understand.
          Bill turns toward him.
                         
                          CLARK
           Have you read Bob's book ?
                         
                          BILL
           No, I haven't.
                         
                          CLARK
          He puts the bag in the pocket of this jacket, and takes a book on
          a shelf. He gives it to Bill.
           It's really... it's quite excellent.
                         
                          BILL
           "Way to go"... I'm glad to hear you liked it.
                         
                          CLARK
          He wipes his hand with a white handkerchief, wipes the handle of
          his black leather case before taking it, and then puts the
          handkerchief in the pocket of his pants.
           Very much. Good night, Doctor Capa.
                         
                          BILL
          Bill holds his hand out, but Clark does not take it. He just nods
          in a friendly way and goes out.
           Good night.
          Alone, Bill flips through the books.
                         
          IN FRONT OF BOB'S OFFICE BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill and Bob come out of the building where Bob's office is
          located. Bob has his jacket on and Bob is wearing a brown leather
          jacket. He is carrying his traveling bags.
                          BILL
           Alone at last !...
                         
                          BOB
           Are you OK ?
                         
                          BILL
           Well, nobody jumped out of the window. So maybe I am making
           progress...
                         
          BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bob's expensive convertible Mercedes starts away. On the back
          license plate, we can read «WAY TO GO». The roof of the car is
          open. The rest of the scene takes place inside the car driving
          through Los Angeles.
                         
                          BOB
           You want to get a drink ?
                         
                          BILL
           Hu-hu !
                         
                          BOB
           You want to get laid ?
                         
                          BILL
          He laughs.
           No !
                         
                          BOB
           So what do you think of my little group ?
                         
                          BILL
           What's Buck's story ?
                         
                          BOB
           You mean, how did he loose his wife and kid. I don't know
           yet. He's not talking yet... Either !
                         
                          BILL
           How about Casey ?
                         
                          BOB
           You tell me !
                         
                          BILL
           Well... I smell money... Lots of it... Maybe an abusive father...
           How am I doing so far ?
                         
                          BOB
           A Plus !
                         
                          BILL
           Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown, and the very
           expensive artistic life style, as long a junior stays in
           therapy.
                         
                          BOB
           You got the hair on the back of my neck standing up !
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, I'm a psychic when it comes to masochists. Five'll get
           you ten he likes to whack now and then.
                         
                          BOB
           Where did you get that from ?
                         
                          BILL
           I was born with it. Like a tuning fork.
                         
                          BOB
           What about Richie ?
                         
                          BILL
           Genuine nut-case.
                         
                          BOB
           Dangerous ?
                         
                          BILL
           Volatile ! Don't fuck with a trapped rat !
                         
                          BOB
           Oh, I see. "Trapped rat" syndrome with a recommendation of
           a "Non fuck with" therapy !
          Bill laughs.
           Well, can I quote you on that ?
                         
          They have reached a quieter road.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, you may. Takes notes, there'll be a pop-quiz later !...
                         
                          BOB
           OK, I'm ready.
                         
          Bob turns on his left to enter his residence.
                         
                          BILL
           All right, if I diagnose a schizophrenia, what do you
           recommend ?
                         
                          BOB
           Don't fuck with it !
                         
                          BILL
           Now, you got it.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A huge sliding metallic door, with spikes on the top, moves
          smoothly to let the car enter. Bill seems impressed by the
          residence of his friend. He looks at the security camera. Bob
          stops the car and they get out of it. Bill takes his luggage.
                         
                          BILL
           It's all one place ?...
          They come near a door shaped like a giant keyhole.
           Goddamn...
          A metallic gate slides behind the door to let them in.
           Like peeking through a keyhole...
          They get down a few steps and reach a lawn.
           You get a very limited... view of the truth....
                         
                          BOB
           What's that ?
                         
          Bill looks with admiration at the pool, and at the huge and
          impressive house, very Hollywood-like.
                         
                          BILL
           "Way to go" must have gone really well !
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          They enter the house. A beep is heard when Bob opens the door.
                          BOB
           After you, wise guy... Come on.
          Bill laughs.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, men...
          He laughs, looking at the luxury that surrounds him. The best and
          the most expensive in modern furniture. Large expensive paintings
          hanged on the walls. Leather armchairs. Bob types a secret code on
          a keyboard. Then he switch on a small TV set that shows the
          pictures from all the security cameras.
           So, how are we as we approach forty ?
                         
                          BOB
           We are in a good shape. Really good shape. We finally got
           divorced. We have some money...
          He puts back in place a painting that was slightly crooked.
           ... We're meticulous.
                         
                          BILL
          He takes off his jacket.
           I don't detect a woman's touch.
                         
                          BOB
           We have a little friend... You'll meet her.
                         
                          BILL
           She's too young for you.
                         
                          BOB
           Ohh !
                         
                          BILL
          He sits behind the bar.
           Always get the clichés and you won't be disappointed.
                         
                          BOB
           This woman is not a cliché.
          He has taken two bottle of beer from the fridge and he gives one
          to Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           Thanks...
          They clink the two bottle and drink the beer from the bottle.
           Good to see you, Bob !
                         
                          BOB
           You too !... So...
          Bill plays with a «piece of art», consisting of an assembly of
          square pieces of glass glued together into a larger square. The
          object can pivot on his stand and, when you look through it, you
          get a distorted view of whatever is behind it.
           You're ready yet ?
                         
                          BILL
           Ready to what ?
          We see the distorted face of Bill through the «piece of art», or
          rather several distorted view of Bill's face seen through each of
          the individual square of glass. Bob pivot the object to have a
          better view of his friend.
           So hard to talk about... So hard to talk about...
          Bill pivot the object again to hide behind it.
           I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game. So I quit my
           practice.
          He gets up.
                         
                          BOB
           Lost you religion, huh ?
                         
                          BILL
          He takes a big book on a shelf. There is a picture of Sigmund
          Freud on the cover.
           Well, I certainly lost my belief in the scriptures.
          He puts the book back, and with his hand, makes a masturbation
          gesture.
                         
                          BOB
           I'm sorry, buddy. You gonna be in a lot of pain.
                         
                          BILL
           There is a distinctive absence of pain. I... I cannot feel
           the pain that I know that I'm supposed to be feeling right
           now. And I think I'm going crazy...
          We feel that Bill is ready to cry.
           I'm lost, man, I think I'm going crazy.
          He has tears in his eyes.
                         
                          BOB
           You may be... Your mind may be shot...
                         
          COUNTRYSIDE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          In front of Bob's residence. The sun is shining. Bill is wearing a
          brown tank top and white jogging pants. Bob is wearing a blue
          cyclist shirt and black pants. They're both wearing caps. They are
          ready to go cycling. We hear the voice over of Bob, finishing the
          sentence from the preceding scene.
                          BOB
           ... but I hope your body isn't.
                         
                          BILL
           Do I get to warm up ?
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !... Two mile any pace you like. And then...
          They mount their bicycles.
           ... let's do ten.
                         
          They are now on the road in front of Bob's residence.
                         
                          BILL
           Ten ?
                         
                          BOB
           Too much for you, huh ?
                         
                          BILL
           I dunno... I was thinking of maybe twenty.
          He starts full speed.
           They are now on a minor dirt road. We can see Bob's house in the
          background.
                         
                          BOB
           Gees ! Billy ! You'll never change... Why don't we just drop
           our pants to see who's got the bigger dick, and then we can
           go back and have a nice civilized breakfast ?
                         
                          BILL
           Wouldn't be civilized...
                         
                          BOB
           Why ?
                         
                          BILL
           You'll be sulking !
                         
                          BOB
          They are going uphill.
           You don't have hills in New-York...
          He slows down.
           Hang on a second... Hang on a second... Hang on a second...
          Bob stops and dismounts his bike.
                         
                          BILL
           What ?
                         
                          BOB
           What was that ?... What the hell was that ?...
                         
          Bill dismounts his bike. Bob gets his bike upside down and sets it
          upright standing on the saddle and the handlebar. He checks the
          chain. Bill is leaning on his bike.
                         
                          BILL
           What are you afraid of ?
                          BOB
           I got a gear slip, here somewhere...
                         
                          BILL
           That's not what I meant... What with the security systems,
           the security gates, looking over your shoulder.
                         
                          BOB
           I've been getting some threats.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you mean ?... Death threats ?
                         
                          BOB
           Pretty sure it's somebody in the Monday night group, I just
           don't know who...
                         
                          BILL
           Monday night as in last night ?
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !... I was hoping that maybe with your tuning fork that
           you might have a hunch.
                         
                          BILL
           No... No hunch, Bob. What make you think it's somebody in the
           group ?
                         
          Bob spins the pedals to check the chain.
                         
                          BOB
           Only about a dozen things... I's been going on for a couple
           of months now. It's funny how it gets you after a while.
                         
                          BILL
           Call the cops ?...
                         
                          BOB
          He puts his bike back on the wheels.
           Yeah ! They say if they had to protect every shrink in
           L.A., they'll need an army ! But that I should call them if
           anything happened.
                         
          They put their sunglasses on.
                         
                          BILL
          He laughs.
           That makes sense.
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah ! Probably, it'll just blow over.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah !
                         
                          BOB
           How about you ?
                         
                          BILL
           About me... what ?
          We see them going very fast on the minor dirt road. A horse rider
          rides near them.
           What would you give a suicidal patient that's got
           everything ?
          They ride even faster while clowning, like riding on the back
          wheel.
                         
                          BOB
           Parachute, I heard it already.
                         
                          BILL
           Out here already, huh ?
                         
                          BOB
           Come on, old timer !...
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The heavy metal door is sliding away. Bob and Bill are getting in.
          They dismount their bikes with some difficulty. They drop their
          bikes on the ground.
                          BILL
           Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in.
                         
          They hold each other by the waist and the shoulders.
                         
                          BOB
           You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to...
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about
           that : "Learning to loose" by Doctor Bill Capa !
                         
          A beep and the second gate gets open.
                         
                          BOB
           Got a ring to it !
                         
                          BILL
           They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo !
                         
          They enter the residence. Bill is massaging his buttocks.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - BOB'S WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Short low angle shot of the whole building, before entering Bob's
          workroom. Bob's desk is decorated with two wrought iron eagles.
          Bob is wearing jacket and necktie. He is just finishing a session
          with a patient.
                         
                          BOB
           See you next week. All right ?
                         
          He escorts his patient to the door. Enter Barbara, Bob's
          secretary.
                         
                          BARBARA
           I'm going now. You want me to lock on the way out ?
                          BOB
           That'll be great, Barbara.
                         
          She gets out. Bob takes his jacket off and sets it on a clothes
          valet. He then stops by the shelves behind his desk and starts the
          music : a concerto for piano and orchestra. He sits behind his
          desk, and starts writing in a large notebook. He hears a strange
          noise, and raises his head. He puts his pen down, open a drawer
          and takes his revolver out. A draught flips the pages of his
          notebook. He seems to feel better, puts the revolver back and
          closes the drawer. Then he closes the notebook, takes it and goes
          to the shelves. He seems to be looking for something, and feels
          worried not to find it. He gets out of his workroom.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          He enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves. He
          looks around and takes an art book about Van Gogh. He checks that
          the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar.
          He takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his
          notebook, puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was
          and puts the art book in the bottom of the shelves. A shadow moves
          on the shelves and a strange noise is heard. Bob, a bit nervous,
          goes to the door and opens it. The classical music stops. Through
          the open door, we can see Bob opening the door of his workroom.
                         
                          BOB
           Barbara ?...
                         
          He comes back into the meeting room. When he enters the room, the
          light is suddenly switched off. He crosses the meeting room. We
          can hear someone chuckling, and we can see a shadow through the
          glass on the door.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bobs gets rapidly out of the meeting room. A man, completely
          covered in black leather, jumps through a large ground glass
          paneI, and jumps on Bob's back. Short fight on the floor. Bob gets
          up, bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor, and
          falls down.
           Close-up of the mysterious man's hand. It is covered with a
          glove. The hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top
          of the hand. Bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest. He staggers
          a bit, takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of
          the mysterious man. He misses and the vase crashes on the wall. He
          is stabbed again in the chest. His staggering increases. He turns
          around and the man stabs him several time in the back. He stumbles
          to the front door. Another stab in the back. The man grabs him by
          his hair to bring him back into the workroom.
                         
                          BOB
           No... Nooooo !... Why ?
                         
          The man stabs him several times. Bob is covered with blood. He
          falls on a glass door. The glass is shattered. Bob falls on his
          back. A big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his
          stomach. Through the window, we can see an helicopter flying over
          Los Angeles.
          MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A car has just stopped in front of the building. The blue
          revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car. An helicopter
          is flying above the building. It could be the same that is seen at
          the end of the preceding scene. Officer Anderson goes around the
          car and opens the door for Bill. Bill is wearing a T-shirt, a
          light sweater and jeans. One can tell he had to dress quickly.
          Bills gets out of the car, and the car moves away. Anderson takes
          Bill into the building.
                         
          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Classical setup of a californian police station. The various rooms
          are separated with glass partitions. An officer enters pushing, in
          front of him, a hooker dressed with a minimum of very flashy
          clothes.
                         
           VOICE OF A POLICE WOMAN
           Have you thought about...
                          THE HOOKER
           Man, I didn't do nothing. Oh, please... You know, you're very
           cute. I love you.
                         
           THE POLICE OFFICER
           I love you too !
                         
          Anderson leads Bill into a room and leaves him there. Bill sits
          down. Enters lieutenant Hector Martinez. He is wearing a pink
          shirt with short sleeves. His tie is badly knotted on an open
          collar. He has a police badge fixed on his belt. He holds a file
          in his hand.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're Capa ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, I'm Doctor Capa.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He closes the door, puts his file on the desk and sits down behind
          the desk.
           You're here because of the dead doctor ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes...
                         
                          HECTOR
           I read something about sessions on Mondays. Tell me about
           this Monday group.
                         
                          BILL
           There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember
           their names right now.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He taps his head with his right hand, a gesture meaning mental
          illness. He has a telephone number scribbled on the palm of his
          hand.
           Like five cuckoos.
                         
                          BILL
           No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At
           least, that's what Bob thought.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Bob Moore ?
                         
                          BILL
           Good. Yes, Bob Moore.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Four men and one woman.
                         
                          BILL
           Right.
                         
                          HECTOR
           And you sat in one of these sessions, right ?
                          BILL
           Yes, I did.
                         
                          HECTOR
           So, who did it ?
          Anderson enters the room behind Bill, carrying a plastic cup.
           Hey-hey-hey-hey... ! Anderson ! This is civilization, man.
           What do think this is ?... Your bedroom ?...
          Anderson gives Bill the cup.
           Damn... Knock... Knock... Don't... don't come into my office like
           that, bro. Hey !
          Anderson leaves the room and closes the door.
           It's third world thing !... Where were we ?...
                         
                          BILL
          He blows on the cup.
           You were probing me about the patients. And I was about to
           tell you that I really can't help you at all. I don't
           really know any of these people.
                         
                          HECTOR
           But you're a professional like me. You gotta have some kind
           of suspicion.
                         
                          BILL
           I really don't have a clue. I'd like to help you, but even
           if I could, there is an issue of confidentiality.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Confidentiality ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Yes.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He laughs and gets up.
           You're talking to me about an issue of confidentiality.
                          BILL
           Similar to the Miranda oath.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He sits down on the desk, facing Bill.
           If a friend of mine got killed, and the only thing between
           the killer and me was Miranda, you know what I will do ?...
           Huh ?... Fuck Miranda up the ass. But don't tell anybody,
           because it's a matter of confidentiality... Shhh !...
                         
          He puts a finger on his lips.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, look ! I'm sorry I can't help you. I've only been in
           Los Angeles four days.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're sleeping at that... dead guy's house, aren't you ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes.
                          HECTOR
           Maybe something will come to you in the night, you know,
           like dreams and shit. But... what happens to patients in a
           situation like this ?
                         
                          BILL
           Usually a colleague will offer to take over the group...
           continue the treatment.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He gets up. We see his pistol hooked on the back of his belt.
           How sweet !... How sweet !... It's like one of the vultures
           dies and then the others step in line and eat his portion.
          He mimes vultures walking.
           Is that what you're planning ?
                         
                          BILL
           No.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Why not ?
                         
                          BILL
           Because I really can't handle that right now.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Sure you can !... Come on !... You've been a week in L.A. and
           you already have you own private screwing farm.
          He sits back on the edge of the desk.
           How bad can that be ?... That's a great career move.... Where
           were you at the time of the killing, Capa ?
                         
                          BILL
          He pauses before answering.
           I was at his house, Bob's house.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You had to think about that ?
                          BILL
           Jesus Christ !... Are you going to arrest me, Lieutenant
           Martinez ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Hey ! You want a lawyer ?
                         
                          BILL
           Do I need a lawyer ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're in L.A. Everybody needs a lawyer.
          He goes back to his seat behind the desk, and conspicuously shows
          his back to Bill.
           All right !... You can go home now, take a shower.
          He turns back to Bill.
           And keep your mouth shut. The only thing that I got going
           for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't
           want the press fucking things up.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Bill plays with the «piece of art» made of pieces of glass. He
          pivots it. We can see Bill's face duplicated by the object. We
          then see Bill putting back in place the same crooked painting that
          Bob had been putting back in place the first time Bill was in the
          house. Then we see him walking pensively around the house.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          A corridor. We hear the buzz of an intercom. Bill comes out of the
          bathroom, dressed in a white bathrobe. He is drying his hair with
          a towel.
                         
                          BILL
           All right !... All right !... Hold on !
                         
          He walks in the corridor, looking for the buzzer. He arrives into
          the main hall, near the video security device. On the wall near
          the TV set, two large paintings showing enlarged footprints. On
          the screen, we see Hector's face.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh shit !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Hector is waiting in front of the gate. He is wearing a grey
          shirt, a beige blazer and a necktie, and a police badge on his
          belt. Next to him is Bob's car. Behind him, a uniformed police
          officer. Hector presses the bell. We hear a beep.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see and hear Hector via the TV set.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Capa !... Capa !... Are you there ?
          Bill takes the remote control.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah...
                         
                          HECTOR
           How is it going ?
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We hear Bill's voice in the intercom.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you want ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           I brought the victim's car back and I got to search the
           house.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          BILL
           You got a search warrant ?
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
                          HECTOR
           What is it with you ? Don't you want me to find out who
           killed your friend ?... No, I don't have a warrant.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          BILL
           All right... Come on in...
                         
                          HECTOR
           Open the gate.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah... Right... How's that ?
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Hector waits a little, then gets sprayed by a sprinkler located
          outside the screen-field.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You got the sprinklers on !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          We hears the end of Hector's sentence.
                         
                          BILL
           How about that ?
                         
          Bill taps on the remote control. We hear a beep. On the TV set, we
          see Hector taking his jacket off.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Hector is searching the shelves on the wall. He quickly looks
          through the books, takes a step back, then thrusts his hand behind
          a row of books, and grabs a photo album. While flipping through
          the pages, he goes to the sofa and sits next to Bill. Bill is
          wearing a white shirt and a pair of jeans. Hector goes on turning
          the pages, and stop on a page with the picture of supine naked
          woman.
                         
                          BILL
           Jill... his wife... his ex-wife...
                         
                          HECTOR
           Nice bush !
                         
          Bill closes the album, takes it from Hector's hands and gets up.
          He turns to look at Hector.
                         
                          BILL
           I'll tell you said so...
          He walks to the shelves and put the album back where it was found.
          He looks at Hector.
           I'm sure it will mean a lot to her...
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Close-up of the head of the bed. It is decorated with wooden
          sculpture of women's faces. Hector enters the room, followed by
          Bill. He goes to the bed and strokes the sculptures.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Check this fucking bed !
          He goes around the bed and sits next to the sculpture, which he
          keeps on fondling.
           Damn !... Everybody is having fun but me, goddammit !
          Hector opens a drawer, and takes a revolver out of it. He holds it
          with his pen stuck into the trigger ring.
                         
                          BILL
           I do not like guns.
                         
          Hector puts the revolver back in the drawer.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You prefer knives ?
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill and Hector are getting out of the house.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I need you to do me a favor.
                         
                          BILL
           What's that ?
                         
          They are crossing the garden. Hector is still in shirtsleeves and
          has some papers in his hand.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I want you to tell the group about Moore's death.
                         
                          BILL
           Me ?...
                         
                          HECTOR
           Yes.
                         
                          BILL
           Why ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Well, maybe one of them won't come in, or maybe they will
           all come in, but then you would be able to spot something
           wrong.
                         
                          BILL
           I just can't handle it right now... OK ?...
                         
                          HECTOR
           I just had all the mess in his office cleaned up. Don't you
           want to help me find the killer ? Have a heart.
                          BILL
           What does that mean?
                         
                          HECTOR
           If you don't tell them, I'll have to tell them. Am I the
           person to break the news to these people ? « Listen up, you
           fucking daffodils, your shrink is dead.
          They have reached the main gate. Hector gets out and Bill presses
          a switch. The gate starts sliding between him and Hector.
           Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in
           this relationship is wasted. You've got to remain as fucked
           up as you are or get worse. »
                         
                          BILL
           You are one sinister piece of work. All right, I'll do it.
                         
                          HECTOR
           It's better if you do it.
                         
          A ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We are in Bob's car, with the roof open. Bill is wearing a green
          polo shirt, jeans and sunglasses. He is on the phone, while he
          drives the car, but he drives slowly.
                         
                          BILL
           No, you listen to me. You don't understand, Gene. Don't
           lie, just give the family what it wants... No... No, you don't
           understand.
          We see Bill from the back. In the rear-view mirror of the car, we
          see another convertible vehicle approaching with also its roof
          open. A young girl is driving. She comes a bit too fast and bumps
          into the back of Bill's car. Bill jumps and stops his car.
           I have to call you back. Christ !
          He puts the telephone back on his hook and gets out of the car. He
          goes to Rose's car. She is leaning on the steering wheel.
           Hey !... You're right ?... Hey !...
          He opens the door. She stands back. She is wearing a large beige
          sweater.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why me ?... Hi !... I'm Rose.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, Rose !... I't nice to run into me like this !... I'm Bill
           Capa...
                         
          He goes away from the car.
                         
                          ROSE
           I got no insurance...
          She gets out of her car.
           I know it's against the law and everything.
          She goes around her car, and looks at the damage.
           Don't bust my chops. I'll bring the money to you, if you
           just get an estimate.
          She stoops, picks up a piece of red plastic and gives it to Bill.
           OK ?... Just give me a break !
                          BILL
           Got a pen ?
                         
          Rose goes to her car and Bill throws the piece of red plastic
          away. Rose gets into her car, looks into her purse, and takes a
          small notebook and a pen. Bill takes them but hesitates before
          writing. Rose smiles mockingly.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, poor old brain can't remember its own phone number.
                         
                          BILL
           I just moved here... From New York... I wrote my address down,
           because I am not sure about this number, and how long I
           gonna be there, so maybe you can call me sometimes for the
           next couple of days.
                         
                          ROSE
           I will.
                         
                          BILL
           Bye !
                         
          He goes away from the car.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hey !... Don't you want my address ?
                         
          Bill gets into his car.
                         
                          BILL
           You could lie.
                         
          He starts his car.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill skip through the pages of a large notebook, looking exactly
          like the one Bob had hidden under a Van Gogh dustcover just before
          he got killed. He puts his back on the two other ones, already
          lying on the desk. He is wearing a grey T-shirt and an open denim
          shirt.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill enters the room, coming from the workroom.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi !... Who hasn't arrived yet ?
                         
                          BUCK
          He is standing up. He is wearing a white T-shirt and a grey
          sweater with a V-shaped collar.
           Sondra... Where's Bob ?
                         
                          RICHIE
          He is wearing a grey sport jacket with a zipper and a striped T-
          shirt.
           Wha... What's wrong ?
                          BILL
           If it's all right, I'd rather wait till you're all here.
           She's always this late ?
                         
                          CLARK
          He is wearing a dark suit, very elegant. He is wiping his hand
          with a handkerchief.
           Depends on who is banging her...
                         
                          SONDRA
          She enters very rapidly through the corridor door. She seems very
          happy. She drops on the armchair next to Casey. She is wearing an
          very close-fitting overall, which is generously open on her
          throat. The top of the overall is very colorful and the bottom is
          black. On top of it, she is wearing a pink sport jacket.
           Oh, I'm sorry... Class was really, really really late.
                         
                          CASEY
          He is sitting in an armchair. He is wearing an grey collarless
          shirt and a black sleeveless vest.
           Was class was that, Sondra ? Advanced cunnilingus for the
           single woman, or a CPR for pleasure and game ?
                         
                          BUCK
           Christ, don't excite her !...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Where is Doctor Moore ?
                         
                          BILL
           There's something I want to tell you.
                         
                          RICHIE & CASEY
           What ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           What's the matter ?
                          CASEY
           Shhhh !...
                         
                          SONDRA
           I'm trying to pay attention... Shhh !
                         
                          BILL
           You should prepare yourself for bad news...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Bob's been killed.
                         
                          SONDRA
          Her face is distorted by the pain. She puts her hand in front of
          her mouth.
           Ohhhh !
                         
                          CASEY
           What are you saying ?... What are you telling me ?
                          BILL
           He was murdered.
                         
                          CASEY
           Sondra !...
                         
                          BILL
           He was locking up here late Friday night.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Here ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, right here in the office.
                         
                          BUCK
           Was he shot... stabbed... beaten ?... Have they got a suspect... a
           motive ? Three days go by, and you don't call us.
                         
                          BILL
           It was easier if you were here together.
                         
                          CASEY
          He stands up.
           Oh, I see. So, even Bob's death is group therapy. That's
           great. Hey, Bob, thanks for giving us a chance to grieve
           together. Shit !...
          He gets more and more angry through the preceding reply.
                         
                          BUCK
          He has become very nervous too.
           What the fuck is going on here ? I need to know more.
                         
                          BILL
           He was stabbed to death.
                         
                          CLARK
           How many times was he stabbed ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She jumps up. She goes to Clark and hits him.
           This man was Bob's best friend. Do you really needed exact
           numbers now ?
                         
                          BILL
          He takes Sondra very gently by the shoulders and brings her back
          to her seat.
           Sondra... Sondra... Sondra... Sondra...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Get your fucking hands off me...
                         
                          BILL
           It's OK... It's OK !
                         
                          CASEY
           It doesn't make sense to me...
                         
                          BILL
           Many times, Clark... More than thirty... It's all I can tell
           you...
                         
                          CASEY
           It wasn't a thief, I can tell you that right now.
                         
                          CLARK
           I agree.
                         
                          CASEY
          He is still very nervous.
           I mean, why stab a guy thirty times ?... Bob !... He'd piss in
           his pants if you showed him a knife, you know that...
                         
                          SONDRA
          She is crying.
           What are you saying ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I'm saying, Sondra, that you really, really have to hate a
           person to stab him that many times. You're a shrink,
           right ? You know what kind of power people hand over a
           shrink. Or maybe sometimes, they hand even more than they
           want to.
                         
                          CLARK
           That is absolutely correct... A thief would not stick around
           and stab someone thirty times.
                         
                          BUCK
          He sits down.
           Since when did you become such an expert on robbery ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           It's not the robbery he's an expert on, it's the rage.
                         
                          RICHIE
          He has seated himself behind Sondra and puts his hand on her
          shoulder.
           What... what are we gonna do now ? I mean u...us, th...the
           group ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I bet Doctor Capa has an idea...
                         
                          BUCK
           What does he mean ?
                         
          Casey hits his forehead. Buck is almost crying.
                         
                          BILL
          He sits down.
           I think Casey is suggesting that I... may have some plans to
           replace Bob...
          Casey sits down.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Maybe you should.
                         
                          BILL
           No... I can't do that... Not right now...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why ?...
                         
                          BILL
           One reason is that I am more screwed up than you people
           are.
                         
                          CASEY
           I was just being obnoxious, and loud before. Anybody has a
           fucking Xanax ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I have a librium...
                         
                          BUCK
           Stop with the drugs.
                         
                          CASEY
           It would be a good idea if you stayed.
                         
                          BUCK
           Bob isn't cold yet ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I mean, there'll be some connections. Right ?...
                         
                          SONDRA
          She gets up and sits down in front of Bill. She takes the cushion
          which was on the armchair and hugs it.
           You were Bob's best friend... You... you seem kind of like him...
           I'll be so much easier to trust you.
                         
                          BILL
          During the following reply, Richie comes and sits behind Sondra.
           I know what kind of force a group can become in your life...
           You tell things here... intimate things that... you wouldn't
           tell your best friend. I'm very flattered that you would...
          He stops. He seems ready to cry.
           But the truth is : You are the people that make this work.
           I would be more than happy to try to find someone for you
           to continue this, but I cannot help you.
                         
                          CLARK
           If my opinion counts for anything, I would like to ask :
           why it is you feel so inadequate for the task.
                         
          Buck comes and sits next to Clark.
                         
                          BUCK
           Maybe he just don't like us.
                         
                          BILL
           No, that's not it, Buck.
                         
                          BUCK
           Why don't you step on something?
                         
                          CLARK
           You stop.
                         
                          BILL
           Six weeks ago, I spoke harshly to a patient. And she
           committed suicide... Right in front of me.
          Clark puts his handkerchief on his lips.
           Perhaps she would have done this, anyway. That's what my
           colleagues say... But I don't know...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, I'm sorry.
                         
                          BILL
          He is crying with big tears.
           And my patient... Her name was Michelle... She jumped out... of a
           window in my office... Ohh... So much blood... And so red... And in
           right time, before my eyes... the red just disappeared... it's
           turned to grey... So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so
           I can't help you... I don't think that you want someone like
           me around right now...
                         
          Clark wipes his face again with his handkerchief. He seems to be
          extremely moved.
                         
                          BUCK
           I think I do.

           call me. I'm not with anyone right now. I'll be more than
           happy to help you in anyway.
          Clark gives his business card to Bill, who takes it. Then he gives
          him a kleenex. Bill wipes his eyes.
                         
                          BILL
           Thank you.
                         
          We see, through the window, light-beams crossing in the sky.
                         
          THE WHISKY BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Usual atmosphere of a well-known bar. At a short distance from the
          entrance of the bar, a truck with two floodlights, the beams of
          which are sweeping the sky. Those beams make the connection with
          the preceding scene.
                         
          THE WHISKY BAR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Quick shot on the very noisy orchestra. A long hair bearded guy is
          playing the drums, a girl is playing the guitar. Bill, dressed
          exactly like in the preceding scene, is looking for someone.
          Eventually he founds him, Hector, who is already seated. Bill sits
          down at Hector's table. Hector is wearing an open dark pink shirt.
                          HECTOR
           You bring me a confession ?
                         
                          BILL
           No.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Well, you win some, you lose some, right Capa ?
                         
                          BILL
           Listen, maybe it was not one of the group
                         
                          HECTOR
           Oh no... he's beginning to like them already. Your friend Bob
           Moore deserves a lot more loyalty than this.
                         
                          BILL
           Hey... Why... Why are we staying here shouting at each other
           for ? What's this place ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           I used to work in narcotics. They used to come here a lot.
           I probably fucked and, or arrested half of these people's
           parents. It's a nice place. I like it.
                         
                          BILL
           Makes sense. Look, I'm sorry I haven't got anything for
           you. I'll see you around.
                         
          Bill gets up and leaves the bar. Hector gets up behind him and
          follows him. They meet back in the street.
                         
          THE WHISKY BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
                          HECTOR
           So, that's it, hey ?
                          BILL
           Yeah.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Anything you want to tell me ?...
                         
          They put back their jackets.
                         
                          BILL
                          NO
                         
           VOICE OF THE CAR VALET
           Yeah, it's a four-door, man !
                         
          Hector and Bill are walking slowly in front of the bar.
                         
                          HECTOR
           So you better shut the group down.
                         
                          BILL
           Who say I hadn't ?
                          HECTOR
           Oh, have you or haven't you ?
                         
                          BILL
           They ask me to take over the group. I couldn't say no.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Ha ! Ha !... I figured... You're gonna do real well in this
           town. Shut the fucker down.
                         
                          BILL
           Stop. You sent me over there.
                         
                          HECTOR
           No, I send you there to convey a piece of bad news...
          A pedestrian bumps into Hector.
           Will you give me a break, will you, man !...
          Hector lays the man on the hood of a car and frisks him.
           I didn't send you there to go trolling for business.
                         
                          BILL
           Come on !
                         
          Hector lets the man go and starts walking again with Bill near the
          bar.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You told me you couldn't handle it.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, it turns out that I handle it now.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You stick you dick in a barrel full of barracudas once.
           Maybe you won't lose it. You leave it in there, it's gonna
           get shewed up at the root.
                         
          They stop walking.
                          BILL
           I appreciate your concern for my dick, Hector, thank you.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I am being really nice, full of concern for your safety, in
           case it's one of them, hey ? Shut it down, OK ?...
                         
                          BILL
           No... I can't do that.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He yells.
           Shut it down, chingada ! Don't be an asshole. You'll find
           another set of wombats to exploit !
                         
                          BILL
           These sudden irrational outbursts, Hector... Did they begin
           in childhood or in puberty?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Get out of my face.
                          BILL
           Am I in your face ? What an interesting choice of words !
           Would you like me in your face ? You're married, Hector ?...
           If you wanna deal with any of these problems, I'll give you
           special rates.
                         
          Bill has moved slightly away from Hector and turns his back to
          him.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Special rates ?... Ha ! ha !... What, like frequent flyer
           miles ?...
          Hector mime something (or someone) crashing on the ground. Then he
          walks around his car.
           Let me ask you something. Are you really color-blind, or is
           that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for
           you ?
                         
                          BILL
           No, unfortunately I am color... Did you bug the office ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Hey, for a shrink, you're pretty fucking dense.
                         
          Hector gets in his car, while the valet is holding the door for
          him. He closes the door and the car moves away, leaving a pensive
          Bill on the sidewalk.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill comes to the keyhole shaped door. We can see his car parked
          behind him. He dial a code on a keyboard and the gate opens behind
          the door. He looks cautiously around him before walking further.
          He presses a switch to close the gate.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Bill enters the house. It is very dark. He opens a glass door and
          walks slowly, while the door closes behind him. He hesitates a
          moment, then walk more decidedly... and falls heavily on the floor !
          He stands back up with some difficulty, and discovers that the
          whole floor is flooded.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill enters the kitchen without switching the light on. He takes a
          big butcher's knife in a stand on the table, and looks in the
          corridor.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill wades in the flooded corridor. He seems worried and we see
          the knife blade shining. He enters the bathroom, the door of which
          is wide open, and opens the shower stall. A rush of water runs out
          of it. An alarm starts sounding. He goes back into the corridor
          and turns off the garden hose faucet.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT
          The alarm has stopped sounding. Bill is wearing short pants and he
          is emptying a bucket of water on the lawn. Then he spreads a wet
          cloth on the back of a seat. Several other wet clothes are already
          drying.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hello !
                         
                          BILL
           Who's there ?
                         
          We see Rose entering through the keyhole-shaped door.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hi !... Remember me ?... Fender-bender !...
                         
                          BILL
           There she is, a little angel, dancing on the head of a pin.
                         
          Rose gets down the few steps to the garden. She is wearing a light
          flowered summer dress.
                         
                          ROSE
           So... did you get that estimate ?
                         
                          BILL
           No.
                         
                          ROSE
           Waow !... Nice place you got here. It's a little cold... but
           it's kind of tasteful, right ?
                         
                          BILL
           And wet !
                         
                          ROSE
           You too, I guess.
                          BILL
           Cold or tasteful ?
                         
                          ROSE
           So... Are we eating in here, or you take me out ?...
                         
          Bill bursts laughing.
                         
          BIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          We still hear Bill's laugh slowly fading out. We are looking above
          the main hall of a big luxurious hotel. Two attendants are pushing
          a baggage cart. We move with them to the restaurant room. Bill and
          Rose are seated at a table.
                         
                          ROSE
           You can't ? ... At all ?... Waow !...
                         
          BIG HOTEL - RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Close-up on Rose putting lipstick on.
                          ROSE
           Not even a shade of pink ?... Can't tell me if it's smeared
           or not ?
                         
                          BILL
           I can't tell you if your eyes are bloodshed.
                         
                          ROSE
           Really !... That's sad !... You know what ?... In respect for
           your infirmity, I'm gonna give up wearing lipstick.
          Close-up on Rose putting her lipstick in her glass of water.
           There is something about me that I bet you find a little
           strange. Right ?
                         
          In several shots during this dialogue, we see Bill seated in front
          of a mirror wall and Rose's reflection in the mirror behind Bill's
          back.
                         
                          BILL
           What is that ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Well, I haven't asked you what you do.
                         
                          BILL
           That's right. You showed a remarkable restraint.
                         
                          ROSE
           Well, it's because I'd rather guess. You know, I actually
           get upset if someone tries to tell me before I can... figure
           it out for myself, you know ?
                         
                          BILL
           But what if I am ashamed of what I do.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why... Why should you be ashamed of being a shrink.
                          BILL
           Who told you I was a shrink ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Well... Are you ?
                         
                          BILL
           How did you know ?
                         
                          ROSE
           The way you looked at me, you know ?
                         
                          BILL
           How I look at you ?
                         
                          ROSE
           You... you have this kindness in your eyes. But I think
           you're using it to keep me away. You know, you're trying to
           play safe. You're trying to think of a case instead of
           thinking of a female.
                         
                          BILL
           So, you have a tuning fork too.
                         
                          ROSE
           I guess we have a lot in common.
                         
                          BILL
           We seem to be playing the same game.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why do you say I'm playing a game?
                         
                          BILL
           Because you're the fantasy girl, aren't you? Quicksilver?
           The face glimpsed across a crowded room?
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah, that's... That's exactly what I am.
                         
                          BILL
           You'll be whatever they want you to be... no substance, no
           rules. Light as air. So your feet never have to touch those
           burning hot coals the rest of us walk around on.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah. Sort of like... not seeing red?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, sort of like that.
                         
          BIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The main hall seen from above. Bill is crossing the hall with Rose
          holding his arm.
                         
                          ROSE
           I was afraid during dinner that you had taken a room
           here... and I might have to decide whether or not to go up
           with you.
          BIG HOTEL - HOTEL MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Rose and Bill are leaving the hotel.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, but that was part of my plan. I mean, I wanted to.
          Bill gives a ticket to the car valet.
           Thank you.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, I need a taxi. Taxi !
                         
                          BILL
           No, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you being so tough
           for ?
                         
                          ROSE
           I'm just beginning to think that maybe I'Il...
                         
          Rose kisses Bill very tenderly, and even with some spirit. While
          kissing, Bill moves Rose to a more discreet place near the
          entrance. He strokes her shoulder and gets the strap of her dress
          a bit down. Then he moves up the bottom of her dress to stroke her
          thigh.
                         
           VOICE OF THE VALET
                         VOICE OVER
           Cab's here ! Yo, who called a taxi ?
                         
                          BILL
           I am thinking you should just let me take you home and
           forget about this stupid taxi.
                         
                          ROSE
          Rose walks to her waiting cab.
           Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay exactly where you are,
           'cause...
          She smiles and looks at Bill's crotch.
           In that condition, you'd get arrested. Start another riot.
                         
                          BILL
           Give me your phone number and address.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why? You want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet ?
           Whatever happened to quicksilver and light as air?
          She opens the cab's door and climbs inside. She waves to Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           She floats away on her sweet young legs. Waves to him once.
           Drives away without a backward glance.
                         
          Rose closes the door and the cabs moves away.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The first sentence of the following dialogue is heard voice-over
          on a wide shot of the modern glass building where Bob's office is
          located.
          BOB'S OFFICE - WORKROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill sits behind the desk. In front of the desk, already seated,
          Dale, Richie's brother. He is wearing an open khaki shirt. Bill
          wipes his glasses and puts them on. He is wearing an open light-
          blue shirt.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie is what he is.
                         
                          BILL
           What exactly is that?
                         
                          DALE
           He was born back of a van going up Route 5 to a Grateful
           Dead concert. The first sound he ever heard was "Beat It On
           Down The Line."
                         
          They both laugh.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, it could be worse.
                         
                          DALE
           Not much.
                         
                          BILL
           How long have you been his guardian?
                         
                          DALE
           Since he was nine or ten. But I've always taken care of
           Richie.
                         
                          BILL
           So, what can I do for you ?
                         
                          DALE
           Um, I was hoping you would help me... get Richie out of
           therapy. Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've been
           like a mother and a father to him...
          Bill takes his glasses off.
           and I know I can get overprotective, but...
                         
                          BILL
           Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ?
                         
                          DALE
           What Richie needs is normalcy.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, normalcy...
          Bill gets up and keeps on talking while walking in the room.
           Normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie has practically been raised by the state...
          Bill sits back.
           ... the social workers, psychiatrists... forcing him into
           this, um, psycho-servitude. He is the sweetest kid you'll
           ever meet, but he thinks of himself as handicapped. It just
           isn't right.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, he's got legal problems. Richie was sentenced by the
           court to mandatory treatment.
                         
                          DALE
           Every kid gets into trouble. And that's why I need you to
           help get him out.
                         
                          BILL
           You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling
           pain... but I want you to know...
                         
                          DALE
           If Richie feels pain... then I feel pain. Pretty much in
           tune with him. I just wish you'd give us a chance.
                         
                          BILL
           Let me check out Richie's status. Then, uh, I'll give
           probation a call.
          Bill gets up.
                         
                          DALE
           Oh, thanks. Thanks, Dr. Capa.
          Dale gets up and shakes Bill's hand.
           I really appreciate it.
                         
                          BILL
           You're welcome, Dale. You either lift weights or work with
           your hands.
                         
                          DALE
           Yeah, uh, I make furniture.
                         
                          BILL
           Really.
          Bill sits back, but not Dale.
                         
                          DALE
           Yeah, I made this desk for Bob, to remind him of New York.
                         
                          BILL
           No kidding.
                         
                          DALE
           We called it the Chrysler desk.

          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Tracking shot starting on a large painting showing a naked woman
          tied with ribbons. We hear the phone ringing. The answering
          machine gets on while the tracking shot moves to a painting
          showing another woman naked but for very small leather panties.
          She is hung upside down with chains and ropes.
                         
           CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hi. This is Casey.
           I can't get to the phone right now, so, uh, leave a
           message. Thanks.
                         
          A beep ends the message. The tracking shot moves on to a
          motorcycle, looking old, then to another painting showing a
          redhead woman wearing a bustier, a garter belt and hoses, all red.
          She is standing on hands and knees and she is wrapped with chains.
          We hear Bill's voice leaving a message on the answering machine.
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Casey, this is Bill Capa. It's around noon. Your father
           sent me a check for the private sessions you were having
           with Bob. Should I send the check back or do you want to
           continue ? Let me know, okay ?
                         
          A click ends the message. During Bill's message, the tracking shot
          moves to a giant plastic statue, with Walt Disney's Pluto's head
          on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to
          another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting
          sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman
          wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another
          painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of
          Bill's message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a
          weightlifting bench. His writs are tied to the vertical bars where
          a dumbbell is resting.
                         
                          CASEY
           I think I want to continue.
          We hear the crack of a whip. Since the shot is showing only
          Casey's head and chest, we don't see who is whipping him.
           You bitch !
          Another whip crack.
           I called you a bitch !
          Whip crack.
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
          Whip crack. The tracking shot starts moving backwards, but with a
          larger angle.
           Oh!
          Whip crack. Casey's voice is softer. Medium long shot on the room.
           Oh! I'm sorry.
          Almost hysterical laugh.
                         
          ROAD IN FRONT OF BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Bill, bare chest, wearing sneakers short pants and cap,
          running toward us. His T-shirt is hanging at his side, partly
          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts. Bill stops running when
          he reaches the mailbox, hesitates one moment, comes two steps back
          and opens the box. Close-up on the box, inside of which a coiled
          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,
          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box, with its
          mouth wide open. Bill falls on the road, where he remains seated
          without moving. The snake, with the back half of his body still in
          the box, doesn't seem to know what it must do next.
           A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked
          on the other side of the road, the car must zigzag and it barely
          avoid driving on Bill.
                         
                          BILL
          Yelling to the driver.
           Hey !
                         
          The car honks. We get a close-up of the driver when the car comes
          very close to Bill.
                         
                          THE DRIVER
           You idiot !
                         
          Bill looks at the departing car and notices a city worker blowing
          dead leaves on the bank of the road.
                         
                          BILL
          He yells to the city worker, but, with the loud noise of his power
          blower, the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his
          work.
           Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit !
          Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He
          crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck.
           Fuck !
          He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox.
           Hello !
          Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall
          on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the
          road.
           I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck
           with me !
          Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks
          at the envelopes.
           Fuckin' bill. Great.
                         
          We see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the
          road. Bill, with his back to the road, is getting ready to enter
          the house. A car stops and honks. Bill turns around to face
          Hector.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Capa !
                         
                          BILL
          He comes back to the car. He looks very angry.
           Oh, that's perfect ! That's really perfect ! Just like a
           cop ! You're never there when you need one !
                         
                          HECTOR
           What did I do now ?
                         
                          BILL
           Somebody put a rattlesnake in the mailbox, Hector !
                         
                          HECTOR
          He laughs.
           A rattlesnake !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
          Bill is washing his arms in the sink.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You scared the shit out of me outside.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, I scared you, huh ? What the hell are you doing here ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           I could use some assistance, some of your professional
           wisdom.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm really flattered.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Everyone in the group has an alibi. Except for Casey. He
           says he was alone in his loft.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah ?
                          HECTOR
           Mm-hmm.
                         
                          BILL
           What does that mean ?
          He dries his arms with a dishcloth.
                         
                          HECTOR
           What do you make of Casey?
                         
                          BILL
           He's a good kid.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're an asshole, Capa.
                         
          Bill turns the water off, throws the dishcloth on the sink. Hector
          walks in the room while wiping his hands with another dishcloth.
                         
                          BILL
           Should we analyze that statement, Hector ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Who is our man ?
           Help me.
                         
                          BILL
           You're the cop. Figure it out.
                         
          He gets out of the kitchen, followed by Hector.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          HECTOR
           You know what I think ? I think it was you. You've got the
           look.
                         
                          BILL
           That's right.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Yeah, I been talking to people who knew you both. Everyone
           says there was a weird competitive thing going between you.
                         
          They have come to the hall where the security TV screens are
          located. They stop walking.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, that's right. There was. I admit it. He was on the
           way up... and I was on the way down.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Including...
          He whistles, miming, with both hands, something crashing down.
           Splat ! It unhinged you.
                         
                          BILL
           I bet you've seen every episode of Columbo, huh?
          Sound of a buzz. The two men look at the security screen.
           Who is it?
          Bill taps on the remote control, and Rose appears on the screen.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hi. It's me, Rose. The old fender bender.
                         
          Bill taps again on the remote control to open the gate, and Rose
          leaves the TV screen.
                         
                          HECTOR
           That's a very young girl to be going around... fending
           benders.
                         
          Bill puts the remote control down and follows Hector to the main
          gate.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Hector is walking to the exit. As he reaches the bottom of the
          steps, Rose is going down. Bill, standing behind a low wall, looks
          at her coming.
                         
                          BILL
           Here she comes. Weightless, hanging from the sky... wearing
           a short dress of indeterminate color.
                         
                          ROSE
           It's red, poor thing.
                         
                          BILL
           Thank you.
                         
          They kiss. Rose takes his hand.
                         
                          ROSE
           I was thinking. Maybe I should see a shrink.
                         
                          BILL
           I can recommend someone.
                         
                          ROSE
           I feel better already.
                         
          Close-up on their kissing.
                         
                          BILL
           God, I missed you.
                         
          They are now at the edge of the pool.
                         
                          ROSE
           This time you won't miss.
                         
          They fall fully dressed in the pool.
           Underwater shot. They keep on kissing in the water. Bill takes
          her dress off. She wears nothing underneath. We can see a rose
          tattooed on her buttock. She slips Bill's short down to his
          ankles. We get a brief view of Bill's penis.
           Above water shot. They are now in the water up to their waists.
          Bill is kissing Rose's breasts.
           Underwater shot. They are back underwater. Bill is kissing Rose's
          legs, and moves slowly up to her crotch. She has trimmed pubic
          hair, but with some left. Still kissing, Bill moves up along her
          stomach and reaches hers breasts, which he kisses greedily.
           Above water shot. Bill is leaning his back against the edge of
          the pool. Rose is lying on him. They are still in the water up to
          their waists.
           Underwater shot. Rose is kissing Bill's chest et goes slowly down
          his stomach, then along one of his legs. We get another brief view
          of Bill's penis. We notice that it is not erected (certainly to
          avoid being X-rated).
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Multiple shots of Bill and Rose making love, seen through the
          «piece of art». Then tracking shot on the two bodies fondling each
          other.
           Shot on the bedroom window, and two hand-glider in the
          californian sky.
           Back to the lovers couple. They are sweating profusely. Their
          position and their movements suggest, without actually showing it,
          that Bill is inside Rose. Bill turns Rose around to put her lying
          on her stomach. Rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very
          tightly. It is suggested that Bill could be sodomizing her.
           They both moan. The moaning increases with a suggestion of an
          orgasm.
                         
                          ROSE
          Still holding the bedposts. She speaks with a breathless voice.
           I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ?
          She turns around to face him.
           I want to get dressed up.
                         
                          BILL
           Right now ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Uh-huh.
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Through the window, we notice that the night has fallen. Bill,
          seated behind the table, is wearing brown suit and necktie, very
          elegant. On the table, wine and water glasses and two chandeliers,
          with a lighted candle. In front of Bill, a plate with food. Rose
          enters the field, carrying another plate, which she sets on the
          other side of the table.
           In the plate, a piece of grilled beef, noodles et vegetables.
           Rose sits behind her plate. As the table is made of glass, we see
          that Rose is naked.
                         
                          ROSE
           You're not eating. Don't you like my food?
                         
                          BILL
           I'd like your food five inches to the left.
                         
                          ROSE
           Okay.
          Rose moves the plate to her left, showing her naked body though
          the glass table.
           But if you don't like this... I have something else for
           you.
           She laughs.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, okay.
                         
                          ROSE
           I think it's ready.
                         
          She stands up laughing. Fade out on the next scene.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill wakes up, naked, and alone in the bed. One of his hand is
          cuffed to one of the bedpost with a long strap. He laughs.
                         
          ARCHIVES ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          An archives room, congested with shelves from floor to ceiling. On
          these shelves, hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of files, stacked
          not too cleanly. Bill is leaning on one of the shelves. The
          archivist, a forty-year old lady, appears from behind another
          shelf, apparently coming down some steps. Bill stands up.
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
           It's a miracle. I found it.
          She starts walking between two rows of shelves. Bill follows her,
          putting his glasses on.
           Here he is. Richie Dexter. Legal guardian: Dale Dexter.
           That's his brother. Kids were put under care, let's see,
           about six years ago.
                          BILL
          He tries to read above her shoulder.
           Does it say why?
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
           Abandonment, abuse. The children were assigned to a, uh...
          She flips a page in the file.
           Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie
           was 12.
          Bill tries to come back to the preceding page, but the archivist
          looks angrily at him, silently meaning he is going a bit too far.
           No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple
           years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until
           recently.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you mean, "lost track" of them?
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
          She closes the file, and keeps on walking between the rows of
          shelves, followed by Bill.
           Like on a radar : One minute a blip, the next, no blip.
           Hey, look. This is the lost souls memorial wing. Children
           of L.A. County of the '90s: 250 000 cases in here, and
           there's two more down the hall.
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          The room is decorated in quite a luxurious way, but with a lot of
          good taste. Paintings on the walls. Bed covered with an
          embroidered bedspread, and many cushions. At the foot end of the
          bed, a small upholstered bench.
           Two women enter the room, laughing and carrying many parcels,
          which they throw on the bed.
                         
                          BONNIE
           Nobody's like your ex-husband!
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's for sure. That's for sure.
          Bonnie takes one of the parcel, a large white box.
           Okay, okay, okay.
                         
                          BONNIE
          She takes a white dress out of the box. For the first time, we see
          a close-up of her face, and we discover she is Rose, different
          hairdo, a lot of almost vulgar make-up, but still, she is Rose.
           Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it
           great ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I know. It's incredible. Look at all these bags.
                         
                          ROSE
          She shamelessly takes off the dress, and, as she wears no bra, she
          stands naked, save for her panties, in front of Sondra.
           Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so
           funny.
          She laughs. Sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend.
           I think I should have got it in green or something.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh ! Oh ! Lush !
          She has put the white dress on.
           What do you think?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She seems very moved.
           I think... you look beautiful.
                         
                          ROSE
           You sure ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, yeah.
                         
                          ROSE
           Come zip me up.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Okay. Okay.
          She gets up from the bed to zip up Rose's dress.
           Oh, this is so tight.
                         
                          ROSE
           Thank you.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I need to find a new husband.
          They both laugh. Sondra goes back sitting on the bed and looking
          through the parcels.
           I need some more money.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings
           anywhere ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She waves the earrings in front of Rose's face.
           Yes, I've got them.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, sweet !
          Rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by
          the earrings Sondra just gave her. She sighs.
           Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           They're so gorgeous, yes.
                         
                          ROSE
           Try yours on.
                         
                          SONDRA
          Sondra doesn't move, feeling very embarrassed by the idea of
          undressing in front of her friend.
           Okay.
          She eventually gets up, an starts taking off the belt from her
          suit. Rose is putting her jacket on. A long silence : Sondra looks
          more and more embarrassed. She snickers stupidly. Rose looks at
          her without really understanding what's going on.
                         
                          ROSE
           What now ? Sondra, what ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She sits back on the bed.
           I feel embarrassed.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why?
                         
                          SONDRA
           'Cause... the way you're looking at me.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra... Do men look at you like that ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           No... Yes... But it's different.
                          ROSE
          She bends to her.
           You know, Sondra... it doesn't have to be any different at
           all.
          The phone rings. Rose starts laughing.
           You better get that.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She takes the phone.
           Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh...
          She seems embarrassed. Rose is making funny faces.
           Um, mmm, okay.
          She stammers a little.
           N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You
           are? Okay !...
          She goes to the window and moves the curtain aside. We see Bob's
          car in the street.
           Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay. I'll see you in a
           minute !
                         
          STREET IN FRONT OF SONDRA'S RESIDENCE -- BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill drives and holds his car phone on his ear.
                         
                          SONDRA'S VOICE
           Bye.
          Bill hangs up his car phone.
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          ROSE
          She is looking at herself in the full-length mirror.
           Who's that?
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's my analyst ! He's coming to visit me.
                         
                          ROSE
          When she hears Sondra's last reply, Rose's carefree face becomes
          very anxious.
           He what?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my God. He's coming over.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, thanks. Oh, thanks a lot !
                         
                          SONDRA
           What's the matter ? What ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Nothing !
          She starts gathering her belongings.
           If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a
           nice afternoon together... maybe have dinner.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She puts the telephone back on its stand and takes Rose's arm.
           Well, we can. Oh, don't worry. Don't be upset. You can stay
           here. Really.
                         
                          ROSE
          She closes her purse and puts it over her shoulder.
           You just don't understand, do you?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I don't.
                         
                          ROSE
           Nobody appreciates you the way that I do. People just use
           you, and you don't even see it.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, don't be upset.
          She turns to Rose to look at her face.
                         
                          ROSE
          Rose kisses Sondra tenderly on the lips.
           That's more like it. Ciao.
                         
          She leaves the room. Sondra seems very disturbed by the kiss. She
          puts her hands on her chest.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my God.
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - HALL AND SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Rose gets quickly down the stairs. Chimes. Rose gets large
          sunglasses out of her purse and adjust them on her nose before
          opening the front door.
           She opens the door to face Bill whom she almost jostle to get
          outside as fast as possible. Through a low window, we see her
          going down the stairs to the street.
           Larger shot. We discover the sitting-room next to the hall. Good
          taste expensive furniture, nice paintings, concert piano.
           Sondra gets down the stairs. Bill, who was looking around him,
          turns to her.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Hi.
                         
                          BILL
           I didn't just walk in on my own.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She closes the front door, which had remained open.
           Oh... no. That was my, um... That was my girlfriend,
           Bonnie. Yeah.
                         
                          BILL
           Bonnie. Yes.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Please, come in.
                          BILL
           Thank you very much. Thank you.
          He enters the sitting-room, followed by Sondra.
           This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.
          He sits on a cushions-covered sofa.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You think so? Thank you.
          She sits on a small sofa without back.
                         
                          BILL
           A lot of nice, nice things. A lot of nice art.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She simpers a little.
           What did you come here for?
                         
                          BILL
           Well, I feel like I have so much... so much catching up to
           do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with
           Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything
           that might help me... understand him a little better.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Richie's... my little baby.
                         
                          BILL
           His brother Dale thinks that your "little baby"... should
           be taken out of therapy.
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's insane!
                         
                          BILL
          He gets up.
           I think it's a mistake too.
          He goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park.
                          SONDRA
           That Dale is a dangerous bastard.
                         
                          BILL
           But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal.
           There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year
           ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did
           you know that he was... molested as a child ?
          She has tears in her eyes.
                         
                          BILL
           No, I didn't know that.
          He comes back to her.
           It's sticking out all over.
          He sits on the bench of the piano.
                         
                          SONDRA
           It's fashionable.
          She laughs nervously.
           I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a
           book, go on Oprah.
                         
                          BILL
           That was quite a show he gave us in group. You think Richie
           has a violent streak ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She sighs.
           Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore.
           You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here...
          She gets up.
           ... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while
           pretending to help your patients ?
                         
                          BILL
           You really think that I don't care about Richie ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She gets upset.
           Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at
           someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who
           could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !
                         
                          BILL
           Clark ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She gets more and more upset.
           Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son
           of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I
           heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on
           my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry...
           whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And
           then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over
           again.
          She sits back. Bill has been listening to her outburst without
          reacting.
           We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes
          immediately. Her angry face becomes suddenly softer.
           She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips.
           Wow ! That's my trainer.
          She gets up and sniffs a bit.
           I gotta go. I gotta get the door.
          She goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young
          man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt.
           This is my trainer, Chris.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi.
          Chris just nods his head.
           Bye-bye.
          Bill gets out. As soon as the door is closes, Sondra literally
          jumps in Chris' arms, and starts giggling.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I don't feel like lifting weights today.
                         
                          CHRIS
           Okay.
                          SONDRA
           Let's do something else.
          She bursts laughing.
           Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the
          street. He stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple !
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bob's car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building, on a
          desert parking lot. The building could be an old factory
          reconverted by Dale into a workshop to make his furniture. A very
          high chimney above the building.
           Bill, dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt, gets out of the
          car and walks toward the building. He passes a board that
          indicates the location of the «office». He knocks at a door with a
          window and a grating and a sign that says «beware of the dog». The
          dog starts barking. Bill knocks again. He tries to look through
          the door window. The dog keeps on barking.
           Bill comes back the way he came toward the «office». He stops in
          front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. He
          knocks on the window. He turns around, and we catch a quick
          glimpse of someone behind the window.
           Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men
          are unloading.
                         
                          BILL
           Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?
                         
          One of the men nods and shows the main door to Bill.
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Entrance of the workshop. The door opens and Bill appears. He
          takes off his sunglasses, puts them in the pocket of his shirt and
          gets in.
           The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.
          On the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted «office»)
          sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to
          watch Bill.
           Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.
          Someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood.
           Bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. Several men are
          working. He approaches one of them, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt,
          and who is welding, with a protection mask covering his face.
                         
                          BILL
           Excuse me.
                         
          The man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding. He
          raises his mask : It's Dale.
                         
                          DALE
           Hello. Did you go to the house?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah. Nobody was home. I would have phoned a...
          Dale shuts his blowtorch off.
           I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone
           number in our file.
                          DALE
          He takes off his mask, then his protection gloves.
           No problem. So, uh, did you make up your mind ?
                         
                          BILL
           After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another
           psychiatrist ?
                         
                          DALE
           No. No, we moved.
          Dale goes around a huge, geometrically shaped, metallic structure.
           Richie went to school. Everything was fine.
                         
                          BILL
           Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I
           don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on
           the brink.
                         
                          DALE
          He starts working on the metallic structure, but stops to look at
          Bill.
           A person, uh, gets a bullet in the head. Sometimes they
           just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain
           is gonna paralyze the person. That's Richie.
                         
                          BILL
           What's the bullet ?
                         
                          DALE
           Whatever it was, I got him away.
          He has taken protection glasses to work.
                         
                          BILL
           You want to talk about that ?
                         
                          DALE
           No. I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let
           the demons rest. You dig around in Richie's head, he's
           gonna blow up in your face.
                         
                          BILL
           You think he's violent ?
                         
                          DALE
           Not with me.
                         
                          BILL
           I think you're making a mistake, Dale. This is not the time
           to take Richie out of therapy. If you don't like me, let's
           get him someone else.
                         
                          DALE
           Jesus Christ. One of you is the same as another.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah.
                         
          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
          Bill gets out of his car. He is wearing light-colored pants, a
          shirt, and a very elegant leather jacket. He walks up a few steps
          toward the house.
           He crosses the garden, then reaches the very impressive main door
          of the house. Above the door, two similar faces are carved in the
          stone. Probably Doctor Niedelmeyer's face.
           A small panel opens in the door and Edith Niedelmeyer's face
          appears.
                         
                          BILL
           Mrs. Niedelmeyer?
                         
                          EDITH
           Yes.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, I'm Bill Capa. I'm a doctor. I tracked you down through
           the Psychiatric Institute.
                         
                          EDITH
           How very enterprising of you.
                         
          She slams the panel shut. A few seconds, then she opens the door.
                         
                          BILL
           Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr.
           Niedelmeyer.
                         
                          EDITH
           My husband died last year. If it makes you feel better, he
           suffered a lot. Well, anyway, it made me feel better.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr.
           Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie
           Dexter.
                         
                          EDITH
           Why don't you leave me alone ?
                         
                          BILL
           If I could just ask you a few questions.
                         
                          EDITH
           You get out of here before I call the police !
          She angrily slams the door shut.
                         
                          BILL
           Just a few questions. Mrs. Niedelmeyer...
                         
                          EDITH
          Voice over through the door.
           Get out of here !
                         
          Bill sighs, then walks away from the door. The camera moves above
          the door and ends up on a close-up of Niedelmeyer's carved face,
          who seems to sneer at Bill.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Night is falling on L.A. Clark, in the foreground, is counting
          books. Behind him, Richie, Buck and Casey are seated, Casey in his
          favorite hand-shaped armchair. Sondra is standing up.
                         
                          CLARK
           Fifty-eight. Now, if I'm not mistaken... last week there
           were 59 books on the shelf and this week there are only 58
           books on the shelf somehow.
                         
                          BUCK
           Clark... what's the ashtray situation ?
                         
          Sondra sits down and Casey sits in another armchair.
                         
                          CLARK
           Three. Not four, as recommended. There are three chairs and
           five assorted sofas.
                         
                          BUCK
           Who cares ?
                         
                          BILL
          He just came in and is standing by the window. He is wearing his
          glasses, jeans, open shirt and a light grey jacket. He turns
          around to speak to the group.
           Okay, let's get started.
                         
                          BUCK
          Finishing a sentence the beginning of which was not
          understandable.
           ... an emotional tar baby.
                         
                          BILL
           Today I'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and
           challenging topic.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She is - a bit lasciviously - sprawled in her armchair.
           Sex.
                         
                          BILL
           More or less. You see, the primary romantic relationship...
           in our life is often a symptom of our illness.
          He has seated himself in the hand-shaped armchair.
                         
                          CASEY
           Glad I wore my rubber pants.
          Buck snickers.
                         
                          BILL
           We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over
           every time we choose a new mate. So... If you had a magic
           wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change
           your partner... Sondra, how would you make them different ?
           What's wrong ? What's missing ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Now ?
                         
                          BILL
           You need a minute to think about it ?
                         
                          CLARK
           She's totally forgot her Rolodex.
          Casey snickers.
           Sorry, sorry.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now. The
           last one sort of went to pieces. If you enjoy sex... A man
           thinks you're doing it with everybody.
                         
                          BILL
           He was jealous.
          He gets ups, walks to a cupboard, opens its door and takes a cup.
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's right. And I was as good as gold.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was
           sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires
           onto you.
                         
                          SONDRA
           This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in
           his pants.
          The whole group laughs. Bill smiles while pouring himself a
          coffee.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Anyway, I do have this girlfriend. She really makes me
           laugh. A wish list. I wish... she was a guy.
                         
                          BILL
          He comes back with his cup in his hand.
           Fair enough. Casey, what do you got for us?
                          CASEY
          He is playing with a small statue of a monkey who looks at a
          skull.. He waits a few seconds, and puts the statue down before
          speaking.
           Well... I met this girl about a month ago. I've painted
           every inch of her in detail. She's the best model I've ever
           seen. Completely uninhibited. Does whatever I ask no matter
           how...
                         
                          BUCK
          He smiles.
           I'll bet she does.
                         
                          CASEY
           That's right, Buck. See, but this is where the problem
           comes in. It's what you see beneath the skin... when you
           study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does. I see a
           transcendental beauty there... beyond anything I could
           ever, ever imagine.
                         
                          BILL
           How does this woman feel about you?
                          CASEY
           She thinks I'm the living end because I've got talent. But,
           I mean, what's talent ? Kick a garbage can... starving
           artists crawl out, right ? But there's only one, unique
           her. And, uh, I think it's love, you know ? And, um... I
           don't know what to do about that.
          He is suddenly moved on the verge of tears.
                         
                          BILL
           Do you think she loves you ?
                         
                          CASEY
           No. No.
                         
                          BILL
           Do you care, Casey ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I don't know. I don't know.
                         
                          BUCK
           He's a romantic. He loves the suffering.
                         
                          CASEY
           Maybe being who I am... I have no choice.
                         
                          BILL
           Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I agree.
                         
                          BILL
           Buck, what do you got?
                         
                          BUCK
          He jumps.
           Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.
                         
                          BILL
           It's not a contest.
                         
                          BUCK
          He lights a cigarette.
           Hey, Yard Sale, you want to share the ashtray ?
          Casey puts his foot on the ashtray to prevent Buck from using it.
           Thanks a lot.
          He gets up.
           Forget it. You want to share something, share the ashtray.
          He sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray on
          it.
           I got something in my life, something new. You know, she's
           young. Auburn hair, 5'5", 105. Pretty as hell. I see her on
           weekends.
          He picks up the ashtray and moves to sit in a more comfortable
          armchair.
           I don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married
           to him.
                          BILL
          He has taken his glasses off.
           Anything else you'd like to tell us?
                         
                          BUCK
           She doesn't mind the gray, you know.
          Bill smiles.
           She's fragile... you know ? It's like she's running through
           my fingers. Two people I loved died. I never thought that I
           could feel anything.
                         
                          BILL
           Good, Buck. Richie. How 'bout you ?
                         
                          RICHIE
          He is playing with the statue of the monkey.
           I don't have,really, relationships. I have m-my brother.
                         
                          BILL
           Okay. You want to talk about him?
                         
                          RICHIE
           H-He worries a-a lot about me. And he l-loves me. But l...
           I wish he didn't... love me so m... so much sometimes. I
           wish l-I had more of a l-life.
          He puts the statue down and gets up.
           And I know that everyone h-here thinks that I'm gay... but
           I'm-I'm not. A-And I don't want to be.
          Richie opens the cupboard, takes a can of Pepsi and opens it.
                         
                          BILL
           What would you like to be ?
                         
                          RICHIE
           I'd like t-to be a w-woman.
                         
                          BILL
           Have you seen a doctor ?
                          RICHIE
           Yeah.
                         
                          BUCK
           So the next step is the chop.
                         
                          BILL
          He cuts him very curtly.
           Thank you, Buck. Anything else you'd like to tell us,
           Richie ?
                         
                          RICHIE
           Nope.
                         
                          BILL
           Very good. Hi, Clark. What would you change about your
           partner ?
                         
                          CLARK
          He is manicuring with his handkerchief.
           Um, I think I'll pass... today.
                          SONDRA
           Excuse me. You think you're gonna pass today ? Don't you
           think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ?
           I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate
           thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ?
                         
                          CLARK
           Well, Sondra, I have my little problems... but I don't s-
           see how it's your business...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Your "little problems" ?
                         
                          CLARK
           To decide when I'm gonna share in group and not.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ah, I see. You're smiling. Is that a smile ? You think this
           is funny ?
          She gets up from her armchair.
           Look at you. Just look at you. Look at your hair.
          Buck snickers.
           Who do you think you are ? Huh ? You think you're God's
           gift to women ? Let me tell you something. You are nothing.
           Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal
           coward ! And I'll tell you what your little fucking
           problems are...
                         
                          CLARK
          He gets ups, looking angry.
           Oh, shut up ! Shut up, shut up ! You promiscuous cunt ! And
           if you must know, I do have somebody in my life ! Black,
           emotional hole, unattractive me !
          He walks nervously to the door. Sondra remains standing, looking a
          bit embarrassed.
                         
                          BUCK
          He snickers.
           You can say that again !
                         
                          CLARK
          He slams furiously the door.
           Fuck you ! Fuck all of you !
                         
                          CASEY
           Is this what you call "treatment failure" ?
          Buck snickers.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, it's not a total loss. He left without counting
           everything.
          He puts down the file he was holding in his hand.
                         
          CLARK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          A quiet little street, surrounded by houses an buildings of good
          standing. Children in roller skates are playing hockey on the
          pavement.
                          CHILDREN
           Come on !... Hey, right here !... Hit it !
                         
          Bob's car arrives in the street. The children moves away to let it
          pass. While Bill is parking the car, we hear, in voice over, the
          beginning of the conversation between Bill and Clark. Bill is
          wearing a light-colored shirt and beige pants.
                         
                          CLARK
          Voice over.
           So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had
           to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of
           pages in each deposition.
                         
          CLARK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Walls are white, furniture modern, but with good taste. Everything
          is meticulously clean and tidy. Bill sits in an armchair. Clark is
          standing by the window.
                         
                          BILL
           So you were fired.
                         
                          CLARK
          He takes off his sunglasses and gets regular glasses from his
          shirt pocket. He is wearing disposable gloves.
           Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave.
          He puts his glasses on.
           "Just please, please don't come back."
          He sits down and sighs.
           I do apologize for my outburst in group.
                         
                          BILL
           You're screwing Sondra... aren't you?
                         
                          CLARK
          He puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket, gets back up and start
          walking in the room.
           I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra
           is... A very warmhearted woman, but...
          While talking, he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants.
           Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without
           cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls.
           Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman
           used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the
           shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There
           were 22 items I couldn't take.
                         
                          BILL
           It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to
           your keen sense of order.
                         
                          CLARK
           I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect.
           She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except
           for the faint smell of perfume.
                         
                          BILL
          Bill sneers.
           Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ?
                          CLARK
           Take a look at this.
          He goes to a closet, from which he gets a paper bag. From the bags
          he takes out a tattered piece of clothing.
           Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was
           wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next
           day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm
           terrified to go near the woman.
                         
          FREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Cars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is
          ringing. Bill picks up the phone, while he keeps on driving. He is
          wearing sunglasses.
                         
                          BILL
           Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa.
                         
           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE
          Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice.
           Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the
           red car.
          Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his
          right.
           You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr.
           Shithead Capa.
          Strange sounding giggles.
                         
                          BILL
           Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?
                         
           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE
           Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my
           scalpel, Doctor.
                         
          Bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red
          car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him
          and bumps into him. Bill jumps up.
                         
                          BILL
           Goddamn it !
                         
          The red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its
          radiator grill.
           Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road
          downtown.
           The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of
          honking.
           Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and
          gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous
          driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on
          following him.
           To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and
          bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the
          pavement.
           The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches
          up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car
          right side.
                          BILL
           Fuck you !
          The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row.
           Fuck you!
          Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it.
          They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close
          to the curb as possible.
           Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck...
          The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open
          door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of
          a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her
          shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump
          again into each other and arrive into a main road.
           When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on
          the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The
          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on
          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road.
          Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and
          causes a pile-up on the road.
           Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a
          railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill.
          Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then
          starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and
          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the
          railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away.
           Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?
          We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and
          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.
           Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car
          forward and the red car quickly moves backward.
           Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.
          We see the train moving behind him.
                         
          MEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular. The first shot shows two
          hands playing the harp. Then we get a larger shot and we see
          Hector and Bill talking together. Bill is carrying his jacket on
          his arm, and Hector is wearing his necktie very loose.
           There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others
          drinking and some are seated to eat. Electric lines with colored
          bulbs are hung in the trees. In the back, the orchestra keeps on
          playing.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey !
          He kisses a passing Mexican woman.
           ? Como esta? Gracias.
                         
                          BILL
           I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car
           wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a
           spooky feeling.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really
           something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy !
          He takes him by the shoulders. They walk out of the field, and we
          see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat. The
          puppet is dressed in a cop's costume !
          Hector and Bill come to the buffet table.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He gets a notebook from his pocket.
           You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday
           group ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain.
          He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He takes a tray and starts reading. A woman is serving him from
          the buffet.
           Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in
           intensive care.
                         
                          BILL
           What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a
           fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands
           died of unnatural causes.
                         
                          BILL
           Probably lost some body fluids.
                         
                          HECTOR
           And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for
           drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the
           house on fire. So what do you think of that ?
                         
                          BILL
           I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves.
                         
          A very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the
          bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a
          helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker.
                         
                          THE VOICE
           Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up
           and your legs spread !
                         
                          HECTOR
           What the hell is this ?
                         
          We see the helicopter and its powerful floodlight.
                         
                          THE VOICE
           Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We
           got something for you !
                         
          We get a better view of the helicopter. The word «police» is
          written on its fuselage. Two uniformed cops are standing on the
          right skid. One has a megaphone.
                         
           VOICES OF THE COPS
           Martinez, happy birthday, man !... Happy birthday !
          The crowd starts singing, accompanied by the Mexican orchestra.
                         
                          THE CROWD
           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good
           fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny !
          Bill and Hector come in front of the crowd, and look up.
           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... !
          People yell and whistle.
                         
          One of the cops standing on the right skid is a woman. She gets
          her pants down and shows her buttocks to the crowd. Another cop,
          on the other skid, has another megaphone.
           People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks.
                         
                          BILL
           If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by
           tomorrow.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Me too.
                         
          The helicopter flies away.
           Large shot on the orchestra singing.
                         
                          ORCHESTRA
           Estas son las mananitas. Que cantaba el Rey David.
                         
          In a corner of the bar, Bill and Hector are eating quietly.
          Thunder rumbles and the first drops of rain start falling. The two
          men get up to find a shelter.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake.
           Ivengan a buscar el cake !
                         
          People stop dancing and run to find a shelter.
                          A MAN
           Everybody inside !
                         
                          BILL
           How come you didn't mention Buck ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           There wasn't anything on him.
                         
          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          It's raining. Bill drives with lights on and roof closed. On the
          side of the car, we can see the dents from the chase with the red
          car. Bill stops in front of a big vehicle. He switches off the car
          lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket
          up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck's house. He goes
          round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill
          touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops
          in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters
          the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after
          inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns
          around. Buck has a gun in his hand.
                          BUCK
           You caught me at a bad time.
                         
                          BILL
           Can we get in out of the rain?
                         
          Slowly Buck starts walking toward the inside of the house. Bill
          starts walking too in front of Buck. They enter the house.
                         
          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          They get inside the house, which is lit only by the street lights
          and a unique lamp above the desk.
           Typical bachelor's place. Very messy. The furniture is simple and
          practical.
           We hear the storm rumbling in the distance.
                         
                          BUCK
           Have a seat.
                         
          Buck gets into the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and
          grabs a towel. He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill
          sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan
          rug. Bill dries his face. He looks at the gun, still in Buck's
          hand.
                         
                          BILL
           I don't like guns.
                         
          Buck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of
          his seat. He lies back in his armchair which rocks a little. Bill
          takes his jacket off.
           A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts
          his hands on his face. He moans.
                         
                         
                          BUCK
           Oh, shit !
                         
                          BILL
           Was it raining like this that night ?
                         
                          BUCK
           Yeah. We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy
           comes out wavin', "Stop!" So I slow down. My wife said,
           "No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the
           baby's asleep in the back." And I said, "Bad neighborhood,
           nothing." So I stopped. Never even made it to the other
           car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes
           wouldn't open. L...
          Another lightning. Buck puts his hands on his head.
           Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy
           rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull
           my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head
           for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my
           daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They
           got $31. The rain nails me every time, man.
                         
                          BILL
           Did they ever find out who did it ?
                         
                          BUCK
           No. I think it was some kind of payback for something. But
           that's a long story.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARAGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The rain has stopped, but the ground is still wet. The garage door
          opens slowly and Bob's car enters the garage. The roof is still
          closed. Bill is on the phone.
                         
          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A telephone rings in an empty office, separated by a glass
          partition from the corridor. The door is open and Anderson comes
          running in, with a ready-cooked dish in his hand. He picks up the
          phone.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Officer Anderson. What can I do for you?
                         
                          BILL'S VOICE
           It's Dr. Bill Capa. Remember me ?
                         
          Low-angle shot of the office, showing the high ceiling, with a
          vintage decoration, contrasting with the modern and functional
          furniture.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Oh, yeah, yeah. The Bob Moore murder case.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INSIDE CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The car has stopped but Bill still holds the phone.
                         
                          BILL
           I need to talk to you.
          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Same low-angle shot.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I hope you're an early riser. I get off at 6:00.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INSIDE CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
                          BILL
           Okay.
                         
          He puts the phone down, gets his car keys and his jacket, and
          leaves the car.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill gets out of the car and seems very intrigued by the fact that
          the keyhole-shaped door is open. He shuts his car door, and walks
          quietly toward the house. He looks around him in the garden,
          seeming more and more anxious. Finally, he enters the house.
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Still anxious, Bill walks along the corridor.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill enters the kitchen. A lot of cooking ingredients scattered on
          the table. A noise makes Bill turn around. Rose, who was kneeling
          behind the table, stands up. She smiles when she sees Bill.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hey.
          She snickers. The only piece of clothing she is wearing is a hotel
          room-maid white apron.
           Busy day ? Can I get you something ?
          Bill doesn't react at all. He looks shocked.
           No ? Okay.
          She crosses the room to get something in a drawer, showing her
          naked buttocks. All of a sudden, she seems to remember she is
          naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on
          her buttocks.
           Oh! I forgot about that !
          She laughs then comes back to the stove, where she moves a dish.
           Bill's face still looks very shocked.
                         
                          BILL
           How did you get in here ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Last time I was here, I stole the key. It was by the door.
                         
                          BILL
           What about the alarm ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh ! I never thought about that.
                          BILL
           It didn't go off ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No. Um, did I make a mistake ? You have someone in the
           car ?
                         
                          BILL
           No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car ! People are
           getting killed around here ! You walk around like it's
           goddamn Disneyland ! What if something were to happen to
           you ?
                         
                          ROSE
          She seems not to understand Bill's anger.
           I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's
           all. You don't look too happy to see me.
                         
                          BILL
          He waits a few second before he cools down.
           This is my happiness mode. I'm sorry.
                          ROSE
          She is crying. Bill comes to her and takes her in his arms.
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. This is a very nice surprise.
          He gives a quick look at her naked body. She laughs.
           Really nice. I'm sorry.
          They kiss.
                         
                          ROSE
           I'll never take a risk like that again.
                         
                          BILL
           Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me...
           your phone number.
                         
                          ROSE
          She laughs and goes away from him and back to her cooking.
           Christ, Capa ! I can't have people tying up the phone
           lines. I'm trying to run a business here.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill, with his shirt completely open, eats spaghettis in front of
          a lighted candle. Rose also eats spaghettis, still dressed only in
          her white apron. Bill drinks from a glass of white wine. Rose
          bites into a asparagus in a slightly erotic way. Under the glass
          table, we can see Bill's naked foot stroking Rose's foot. With her
          other foot, Rose moves Bill's pants up. Rose slides down on her
          chair, so Bill can reach her feet with his hands. Then Rose slides
          completely out of her chair and under the table.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A toy remote-controlled tank is moving on Rose's naked legs. The
          shot gets larger and we discover that Rose is in a bathtub full of
          foaming water.
                          BILL
          Voice over.
           General Patton comes out of the foothills.
          The tank moves on Rose's pubis, then on her stomach.
           Oh, he's in the swamp. Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss.
          The tank skid on Rose's naked skin and doesn't succeed in climbing
          on her breast. We then see she is lying on her back on Bill's
          naked body, who is also lying on this back in the bathtub.
           Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem. He's up in
           the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen.
          They both laugh. We see Bill's hand holding the remote control.
           Fire one. Fire... Oh !... A direct hit !
          The tank skids into the water and stops.
                         
                          ROSE
          Voice ironically disappointed.
           Oh.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.
                          ROSE
           Yeah ?
                         
                          BILL
           It's goin' away.
                         
                          ROSE
          She turns around and we guess she is grabbing Bill's penis under
          water.
           How's the submarine fleet ?
                         
                          BILL
           Hey, hey, hey, hey, please, please. I gotta get some sleep.
                         
                          ROSE
          They kiss.
           Oh, you're chicken.
                         
                          BILL
           I gotta be up...
                         
                          ROSE
           You're chicken.
                         
                          BILL
           I gotta be up at 6:00 in the morning.
                         
                          ROSE
          She turns around to kiss him.
           You're chicken, chicken.
                         
          LOS ANGELES CENTRAL MARKET - MARKET BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Tracking shot down a high glass building until it reaches the
          entrance of the «Grand Central Market».
           We hear Anderson and Bill in voice over.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Nobody told me Buck was one of your patients.
                         
                          BILL
           "Nobody," like Martinez ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Right.
                         
                          BILL
           That's the same "nobody" who didn't tell me Buck was a cop.
                         
          The camera is now on street level and we see Bill and Anderson
          crossing the street towards the main gate of the market. They pass
          a truck delivering fresh meat.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Fucking Martinez. That's a can of worms you don't want to
           mess with.
                         
                          BILL
           What about Buck ?
          They enter the market.
                         
          LOS ANGELES CENTRAL MARKET - INSIDE THE MARKET - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Hey, look, you gotta promise... if I tell you what I know
           about this shit, it stays between me and you. And you never
           heard it from me, okay ?
          They walk in the market alleyways. Anderson stops near a stall,
          and starts talking to a stall-holder we do not see.
           Two, Angelo.
                         
                          BILL
           Why ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Why ?
          Two uniformed cops are walking between the stalls. Anderson raises
          his voice to them.
           Because cops are vindictive sons of bitches. Right, Alex ?
          He throws a chicory to a cop, who catches it.
                         
                          ALEX
           Right.
                         
                          ANDERSON
          The cops are gone away. Anderson lowers his voice.
           Fucking asshole. I don't want to spend the rest of my
           career getting pissed on from above, okay ?
                         
                          BILL
           Okay.
                         
                          ANDERSON
          He laughs nervously.
           Martinez was nailin' Buck's wife.
                         
                          BILL
           Holy shit.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Yeah. Both these guys were in narcotics. And those guys
           usually stick together like shit on a shirt... so who knows
           how long it's been going on. Anyway, one day, it came out.
           In the station, they had this big fight in front of
           everybody.
          Anderson takes two little wrapped packages from the unseen stall-
          holder and gives one to Bill.
           Two days later, Buck's wife gets blown away.
                         
                          BILL
          He follow Anderson between the stalls.
           Jesus Christ ! Was there an investigation ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Of course there was an investigation. Martinez was a
           suspect. Buck was a suspect. I mean nobody figured Buck
           forgiving her. For a while, half the station was a suspect.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you think ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the
           street. This was just payback
           for both of 'em.
          They have come to a fishmonger stall. The fishmonger wraps a fish
          for Anderson.
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Casey is lying on an exercise bench and lifting weight with a
          pulleys and cables device.
           The phone rings. Casey doesn't move.
                         
           CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hi, this is Casey. Can't get to the phone right now, but
           please leave a message.
          A beep, then Bill's voice.
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Casey, it's Bill Capa. I got your message and, sure, I can
           make it today. Are you there ?
                         
          A hand appears holding a leather collar, which the hand wraps
          around Casey's neck.
                         
                          CASEY
           Hey !... What... What the hell are you doing here ?
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hello ? Listen, Casey, y-you sounded a little upset. Just
           hang in there, okay ?
                         
                          CASEY
           Let me get this, huh ? No ?
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           I'll be by this morning. So I'll see you in 30.
                         
                          CASEY
           Well, you think you can do it in 30 ?
                         
          He snickers while the hand tighten the collar around his neck.
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - PARKING IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bob's car stops in front of the building. Bill, wearing
          sunglasses, gets out of the car and walks toward a three-story,
          impressive but a bit dilapidated, brick building. Evidently, it is
          an old workshop changed into an artist's loft. We can still read
          «Nate Starkman & Son» on the front of the building.
           Bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom
          button. No answer. He tries again. He raises his head to the above
          windows. No one. He walks a few steps back to get a better view of
          the building.
                         
                          BILL
          He yells.
           Casey !
          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Casey is still lying on his exercise bench. Both his hands are
          tied to the weight-lifting device, and his mouth is gagged. He
          groans through the gag.
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
                          BILL
          He puts his hands around his mouth to make his voice louder.
           Casey !
                         
          He comes back to the door and presses the intercom button several
          times. He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He
          test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of
          the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it. He reaches
          the ladder, which he brings down.
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - ROOF OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill is now on the roof of the building. He jumps down in a sort
          of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern
          furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a
          cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow's snout,
          stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of
          the yard. He notices he is above Casey's workshop. He walks along
          the glass wall to a closed window, from which smoke is coming out.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, Jesus Christ.
          Bill succeeds in forcing the window open. A big cloud of smoke
          gets out of it.
           Casey ! Hey !
          He walks through the open window.
           Casey!
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
          Bill walks on the upper gallery, coughing with the smoke. He takes
          off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He
          gets very quickly down the steps to ground level.
           He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are
          burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put
          the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and
          shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece.
           A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,
          flooding the room with bright light.
           Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings
          have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair
          woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the
          mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought
          was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from
          the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a
          woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose.
           He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on
          the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this
          slimy liquid.
           He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable
          line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the
          same cable, comes Casey's body, hanging upside down. He looks dead
          and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is
          covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey's
          blood.
                         
                          BILL
           Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit !
                         
          Suddenly the blood, which was grey seen through Bill's eyes, turns
          red.
                         
          A ROAD - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Sondra's car. Sondra is driving. Rose is on the passenger seat,
          with her Bonnie's hairdo and make-up. The car radio is playing a
          song.
                         
                          ROSE
           I love this song.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I know.
                         
          Honking. Two thirty-year old men, in an open convertible red car.
                         
           THE RED CAR PASSENGER
           You girls want to go dancing ?
                         
           THE RED CAR DRIVER
           Yeah. We're going to a party.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Hi ! Hi !...
                         
          Rose bends over Sondra and kisses her tenderly.
                         
           THE RED CAR PASSENGER
           Well, pardon me !
          The two men look disappointed. Their car speeds up and goes away.
          The two women start laughing. Rose stands up through the open roof
          of the car. She waves to the passing cars. She then sits down and
          moves tenderly very close to Sondra.
                         
                          SONDRA
           What are you doing ?
          Rose takes Sondra's hand and guide it under her skirt toward her
          crotch.
           Wha... No!
          Sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away. Rose keeps on
          cuddling Sondra who tries to concentrate on her driving.
           Don't ! Don't !
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Music from preceding scene has gone on without interruption. The
          two girls are dancing in front of the mirror. Sondra is wearing a
          tight-fitting black dress and Rose a skirt and a short top which
          shows her belly.
                          SONG WORDS
           Out all night Lady did. When nobody else would. Lady did
           And she did it real good. Once was not enough.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ah !
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, go !
                         
                          SONG WORDS
           Tell me, Katie What would your mama say.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.
                         
          While Sondra moves away to change the music, Rose goes to the
          window. In the house across the street, she sees a couple kissing.
          The music stops.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, come here. Oh, come here. My God !
                         
                          SONDRA
          She comes near Rose.
           Oh, my God !
                         
                          ROSE
           These are your neighbors !
                         
                          SONDRA
           They do this all the time.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!
                         
                          ROSE
          She bends down under the window sill and get Sondra down too.
           They're gonna see you !
                         
          They get up and keep on watching.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, I don't believe it !
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, this is the part ! This is the part !
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my gosh !
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh !
                         
                          SONDRA
           Believe me, they can fuck.
          They laugh.
           Oh, I can't watch this anymore. I didn't see anything.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, Sondra, go. I love this song.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Yeah.
                         
          The two girls start cuddling each other. Sondra strokes Rose's
          naked stomach, then her face.
           Close-up on the mirror, which shows the fire in the mantelpiece,
          between the girls legs.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, through the window ! Look ! Look !
                         
          The camera remains on the mirror, which shows the two girls
          climbing on the bed to get a better look.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, what are they doing now ?
                         
                          ROSE
           I can't tell.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Are they gonna do it ? No !
                         
          We see the couple in the house across the street. She is only
          wearing panties and her breast is naked. He is only wearing his
          trunks. They flirt on the couch.
                         
                          ROSE
           My God ! It's gonna happen right now.
                         
          Back to the mirror shot. The two girls, still standing up, are
          slapping each other buttocks. Rose raises Sondra's dress.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ow !
                          ROSE
           Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
          She sits on the bed and picks up a champagne glass.
           Oh, champagne.
                         
          Sondra comes and sits next to her. Rose gives her her glass.
          Sondra drinks.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Mmm.
                         
          Sondra gives the glass back to Rose, who puts it on a furniture.
          The two faces come very close, and the two girls start exchanging
          tender little kisses. Then Rose moves Sondra's dress down and
          takes her own top off, showing her breast. Sondra seems very moved
          by what she sees. She strokes Rose's face. Their lips are getting
          very close.
           We see Sondra's hand going down Rose's back, and slipping under
          the top of her skirt, showing her buttocks. We see the tattooed
          rose.
                         
                          ROSE
          She moves her face away from Sondra.
           No, no, Sondra. I can't. I can't.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why ? It's wonderful.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, I'm a jinx.
                         
                          SONDRA
           No. We can cancel each other out.
                         
                          ROSE
          She sobs a little.
           No. I'm not who you think I am. Oh, God, I'm in love with
           somebody and it's all falling apart. I'm sorry.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Look, the sky isn't falling down.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yes, it is.
                         
                          SONDRA
           No. Let's get that silly thing off your head. There. I love
           your brown hair.
          She strokes her hair.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill sleeps on a leather couch, dressed with a western-style shirt
          and jeans. There is a gun on the low table near his head. We hear
          a buzz. Bill wakes up, gets up and looks at the security TV set.
          He takes the remote control to change the camera.
                         
                          BILL
           Who is it ?
          After two unsuccessful pictures, Rose appears on the screen. She
          is wearing very short pants, a flowered blouse knotted under her
          breast and a small backpack.
                         
                          ROSE'S VOICE
           I'm back.
                         
          Bill opens the gate and looks through the window at Rose crossing
          the garden.
                         
                          BILL
           Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making
           her look even younger than she is.
          Rose enters the room, puts her backpack down and falls in Bill's
          arms.
           She falls into his arms. And they kiss.
          They kiss.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if
           you'd be in.
                          BILL
           I don't have to be anywhere until this evening.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah ?
          She opens her blouse. She doesn't wear a bra and her nipple
          appears.
           So, what color are my nipples ?
                         
          They both laugh. She covers and uncovers her nipple. They kiss
          tenderly.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better
           than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I
           mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you
           do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all
           the power. I just sit around here and wait for you.
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries.
           You do ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the "what I
           wait for" department, you're it.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, my.
                         
          Time has elapsed. They are now seated next to each other. Bill is
          bare-chest and Rose is wearing one of Bill's denim shirts. They
          look at a photo album. Rose puts her finger on the pictures and
          Bill tells her who it is.
                          BILL
           Bob's wife. My ex-wife.
                         
                          ROSE
           She's pretty.
                         
                          BILL
           Pretty fucked up.
          Rose flips the page. A picture of Bob.
           Oh, God. I forget that he's dead.
          She kisses him tenderly to comfort him.
                         
                          ROSE
          She flips the page.
           He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these
           taken ?
                         
                          BILL
           Ten years ago.
                         
                          ROSE
           Really ? Do you have anything more recent ?
                          BILL
           Maybe. Hold on.
          He gets up and goes to the shelves. He start looking for another
          album.
           I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except
           maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which
           leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead
           as they were pretending.
          He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album.
           I don't know who these people are.
                         
                          ROSE
          She seems very worried all of a sudden.
           No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go
           outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna?
                         
          Bill looks at her, a bit disconcerted by her unexpected reaction.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We hear the birds chirping. By the poolside, Bill is lying on his
          back on a mattress. He is wearing sunglasses, and is naked except
          for a white towel spread on his pelvis. Rose is lying on her
          stomach, head to foot with Bill. She is naked but is wearing one
          thick woolen sock on one foot.
                         
                          BILL
           One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered.
                         
                          ROSE
          She seems very disturbed by the news.
           What ?
                         
                          BILL
           The painter. Casey.
                         
                          ROSE
          She has tears in her eyes.
           Were you there ?
                         
                          BILL
           A little bit after.
                         
                          ROSE
           What did you see ?
                         
                          BILL
           You don't want to know.
          He takes off his sunglasses and start getting up, covering his
          crotch with the towel.
           About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You
           gonna be okay out here ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill enters the bathroom and turn the shower faucet on. Then he
          gets out of the room.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill takes a pair of jeans in the closet and puts it on, without
          underwear.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Rose has dressed up. She enters the room and goes directly to the
          shelf where the photo album was hidden. She gets it and starts
          turning the pages.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - UPPER GALLERY - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill comes out of the dressing room, and into a gallery above the
          sitting room. He sees Rose looking through the album, taking a
          picture out of the album and then putting the album back where it
          was. He hides behind a wall for her not to see him. She is looking
          inside a photo-lab envelope. Bill comes out of his hiding.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose.
                         
                          ROSE
          She jumps.
           Oh ! Oh !
          She drops the envelope, picks up her backpack and runs out of the
          room.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! Rose !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Rose runs to the keyhole-shaped door. The gate opens and Rose runs
          out.
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill runs down the stair from the upper gallery. He is bare chest
          with his shirt in his hand.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - ROAD IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Rose gets out of the residence and runs to her car, a small ORV.
          She climbs in and starts very fast. Bill gets out of the house.
                         
                          BILL
          He jumps into his car without opening the door.
           Rose ! Jesus !
                         
          Bob's car get's out of the residence.
                         
          MAIN ROAD, THEN CITY STREETS - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Bill driving his car. He chases Rose, whom we then see in
          her car. Tires screech with the high speed driving. Bill comes
          closer to Rose and tries to memorize her license plate numbers.
                          BILL
           2ASB... 185...
                         
          The chase goes on. Rose drives very recklessly, Bill too. He
          drives through the cross roads without slowing down.
           A man, who was seated on a low wall, has to climb on it to avoid
          Bill's car, which is driving on the sidewalk. Bill stops near him.
          We hear the voice of an angry woman.
                         
           VOICE OF THE ANGRY WOMAN
           Oh ! Stupid, crazy bastard ! They'll give anybody a
           license !
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Outside, night has fallen and it is raining.
                         
                          CLARK
          He is very smartly dressed, and even wears a bow tie. He counts
          the books on the shelves.
           Five and six are 31. Seven, seven, that makes 45. And that
           will remain 45, and every single time you count it, it will
           be 45, no matter what. And then this is five, and that
           makes 50. And nine is 59. Now that's odd. That's really
           odd. Now there's 59 again.
                         
                          BILL
          He has just come into the room.
           What ?
                         
                          CLARK
           Well, last week... there were 58 books on the bookshelf
           where there is always... and I mean always, 59 books, and
           this week there are 59 again, so I don't...
                         
                          BILL
          He turns toward Sondra.
           Which one, Sondra ?
                          SONDRA
          She is very smartly dressed too, in a white suit with black
          collar. She sighs.
           I didn't read any of it. Really. I felt so bad when I got
           it home. I couldn't help myself.
                         
                          BILL
          He moves rapidly to the shelves.
           Which one, Sondra ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           It... The Van Gogh. But I didn't read any of it. Honestly,
           I promise !
                         
          Bill takes the book and moves away from the shelves. Sondra signs
          menacingly to Clark.
                         
                          CLARK
           What did I do ?
                         
          Bill has seated himself, and he looks through the book. Sondra
          tries to read above his shoulder. Close-up of the book. It is
          Bob's diary. Close-up on one paragraph. We hear Bob's voice
          reading the paragraph.
                         
                          BOB'S VOICE
           I was right about the threats from the Monday group. This
           cycle of pain. Yesterday's victim becomes tomorrow's
           monster. Today's the day.
                         
          Buck enters the room.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi.
                         
          Buck starts closing the door, but Richie comes in.
                         
                          BUCK
           Hi, Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, Buck.
          Buck sits down.
           Casey, uh... is not gonna be joining us tonight, so I think
           we should get started.
                         
                          BUCK
           That's typical.
          Thunder rumbles. Buck puts his hands on his head. Richie looks at
          him.
           Oh, shit!
                         
                          CLARK
           Buck, are you all right ?
                         
                          BUCK
           It's none of your fucking business.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really.
                         
                          CLARK
           I'd like to start, if I may. I'd like to apologize to the
           group and Sondra.
          While he is talking, Bill keeps on looking through his friend's
          diary. A photo is stuck between two pages. It is a photo of Rose
          naked.
           Everything that you said last week in group was right, and
           that's why I lost my temper. Uh, the young lady that I
           mentioned last week... that relationship has been
           terminated. No reason and no hope. She just, just called...
           and told me, and that's it.
                         
                          BILL
          He reads what is written on the back of the photo.
           "The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a
           normal character together, can become anything. Amorality
           frees her to be universally perfect. A charming chameleon
           with a scorpion's tail." Do any of you recognize...
           recognize this woman ?
          He gives the photo to Sondra.
                          SONDRA
          She laughs and brings the picture to her chest.
           Oh, my God ! Oh ! This is my girlfriend. This is Bonnie.
                         
                          BUCK
          He tears the picture away from her hands.
           Give me that !
          He looks at the picture and turns to her.
           This your Bonnie ? This is your Bonnie ? Yeah ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Yeah. Yeah.
                         
                          BUCK
           The one you've been boring the living shit out of us with ?
           This is the one that's saving you from yourself ? Your
           shopping mall hag ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Shut up.
                         
                          BUCK
           The one that makes you smile ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Shut up !
                         
                          BUCK
           The one that you wish was a man ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           What are you getting at, Buck ?
                         
                          BUCK
           That Bonnie ? Is that it ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's right, that's it. That's right, That's right.
                         
                          BUCK
           Sondra... this is my Bonnie.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She bursts laughing, but she has tears in her eyes.
           You're lying. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying ! I
           don't believe you !
                         
          Bill looks intensely at her. Sondra has started sobbing.
                         
                          CLARK
          He tears the picture away from Buck's hands.
           Let me see that.
                         
                          BUCK
          He puts his head in his hands.
           Fuckin' A !
                         
                          CLARK
          He looks at the picture.
           Well, yes, of course. This is the woman that I've been
           talking about. This is my Bonnie.
          Buck tears the picture away from his hands.
           Goddamn it, Buck ! Don't do that ! Do not do that !
                         
                          BUCK
           Hey, hey, hey !
                         
          They are ready to fight. Sondra comes between them. The three of
          them are talking together.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You're lying to me ! Why are you lying to me ?
                         
                          CLARK
           Stop acting like an... Like an emotional child !
                         
                          BUCK
           Goddamn tar baby !
                         
                          SONDRA
           You're making it up ! You're making it up !
                         
                          CLARK
           Nobody's making anything up... and stop it, stop it, stop
           it !
                         
          During this heated verbal exchange, Richie has picked the fallen
          picture from the floor.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Stop it !
                         
                          CLARK
           Quit it ! You're crumpling the picture up ! I want you to
           stop showing off ! You're a little brat !
                         
                          BUCK
           Fuck it ! You have the emotions of a styrofoam cup !
                         
          We see Richie putting the picture away and leaving hurriedly.
                         
                          CLARK
           You calm down, and you stop...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Where's the picture ?
                         
          Lightning, thunder, and the pictures appears close-up in a hand.
          It is Hector's hand, who looks at them all, sneering.
                         
                          HECTOR
           How in the name of God... could all of you be going out
           with the same woman and not know ? Not have a clue ?
           Including you, Mr. Psycho-fucking-analyst ? Not to mention
           Bob Moore... who probably took this amazing picture himself
           in front of his expensive painting. I'm gonna call the
           Guinness Book of World Records... because I think this
           woman deserves credit. And I'm gonna make sure that all of
           your names are included... so you can all share in the
           glory.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, you should know something about sharing, huh,
           Hector ? I mean, you and Buck must have shared some very
           tender moments... discussing his wife. Huh ? Why didn't you
           tell me the truth ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           What truth is that ?
                         
                          BILL
           Why didn't you tell me Buck was a cop... not to mention a
           suspect in a murder case ? Not to mention you, goddamn it.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Because... I'm not your patient, and I don't have to tell
           you shit !
                         
                          BILL
          He jumps on Hector. Bucks tries to take them apart.
           That's right, you don't have to tell me shit ! Fuckin' tell
           me anything, do you ? Why won't somebody tell me some
           fucking truth ?
                         
                          BUCK
          He has succeeded in taking them apart.
           Get the fuck out of here !
                         
                          BILL
           One fuckin' thing ! Can you do that, Buck ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           You really know how to pick your women, you know that ?
                         
                          BILL
           I know you can't... you lyin' sack of shit !
          He wants to jump again on Hector. Buck holds him back.
           You can't fuckin' do it !
                         
                          BUCK
           Listen. After my wife died, I wanted to slaughter this
           cock-sucker !
                         
                          SONDRA
           Don't ! No more !
                         
                          BUCK
           But I realized we both loved her. It became a, sort of a
           bond between us. Isn't that right, Hector ? Isn't it ?
           Hector ! Jesus God ! I never got the chance to forgive her.
           So I forgave him instead.
                         
                          HECTOR
           All right ! So much for the famous fucking Monday group !
           Now we have a suspect with a tattoo on her ass and no
           address. Now the cops need your help. What about the car ?
           Anybody around here wrote down the license plates numbers ?
                         
                          BUCK
           "The license plates numbers" ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           We didn't even...
                         
                          HECTOR
           Huh ?
                         
          Bill looks at Hector, but says nothing.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Well, I didn't think to-to-to write it down.
                         
          PALACE HOTEL - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Revolving door of the entrance of the hotel. People are coming
          incessantly in and out. Among them we see Bill coming in. The
          following dialogue is in voice over on the shot of the revolving
          door.
                         
                          HOTEL ATTENDANT
           Hey, welcome back to L.A., Miss Brown.
                         
           HOTEL FEMALE GUEST
           Thanks. Put my bags in my room.

          HOTEL FITNESS CENTER - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry, dressed in tracksuit, is working with one of the fitness
          devices. Bill is standing in front of him.
                         
                          BILL
           I don't think she is a sociopath.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, then how about something simple and snappy like a
           multiple personality disorder ? You've fallen into a trap.
           You are not well. She is not well. And to you, Iit feels
           like a bond.
          He gets up and starts walking in the room. Bill follow him.
                         
                          BILL
           She's been acting this thing out as if... it's the only way
           for her to have a life.
                         
                          LARRY
           Or lives.
                         
          HOTEL SWIMMING POOL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry is sitting in a whirlpool. Hot water is bubbling all around
          him. Bill is seated by the pool side.
                         
                          LARRY
           You really want to go on seeing her, do you ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, I want to see her.
                         
                          LARRY
           In a, a nonprofessional sense ?
                         
                          BILL
           In every sense.
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't have your magical tuning fork. All I know is that
           two people are dead... and she seems an excellent suspect.
           Bill, salmon swim upstream to mate and die. And so do men.
                         
                          BILL
           Is that what I'm doing?
                         
          A STREET NEAR THE MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Anderson is walking in the street, a coffee paper cup in his hand.
          He is wearing suit and sunglasses, but also a very flashy necktie.
          Bill dressed in open shirt and sunglasses, walks toward him.
                         
                          BILL
           Anderson ! I need your help with something.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Hey, man, how ya doin'?
                         
          They start walking together in the street.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm sitting in a restaurant last night, and I'm looking out
           the window... watching this woman trying to back out of a
           space right in front of mine.
                          ANDERSON
           A beautiful woman ?
                         
                          BILL
           Stunning. Anyway, the next thing I know, she busted out the
           headlight on my car.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Uh-oh. Drives away, right ?
                         
                          BILL
           I don't even think she knew what she did.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           But you'd like to meet her ?
          Bill answers with a silly smile.
           All right, um, I'll see what I can do. You got the license
           number ?
                         
                          BILL
          He gets a piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and gives it to
          Anderson.
           Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Sure.
                         
          The two men split up. Anderson walks into the police office.
                         
          STREETS, THEN PARKING BUILDING IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bob's car, still dented all over, starts, with open roof, and Bill
          driving. He is wearing sunglasses.
           As the car passes a crossroad, we see, coming on its right , the
          «red car», also dented all over. It starts following Bill.
           Bill parks his car on a parking lot, at the bottom of a parking
          building. The red car climbs to the roof of the building.
           Bill cuts the ignition off, takes his keys and gets out of the
          car. He starts walking along the building, the red car following
          him from the roof.
           The red car stops behind a car parked on the edge of the roof,
          then starts pushing the car. The car breaks the guardrail and
          falls down to the ground. Bill raises his head, sees the car
          coming down, jumps away and falls flat on the ground, just
          avoiding the falling car, which crashes on two other parked cars.
          We see the front of the red car appearing behind the broken
          guardrail. Bill bangs his fist on the ground, while pieces of
          broken cars are flying all around him.
                         
                          BILL
          He yells.
           Damn !
                         
          BUILDING WITH GALLERIES - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          A very picturesque building with multiple open air galleries. On
          one of the galleries, Anderson walks toward Hector who is pointing
          a menacing finger to him.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I ought to shoot you!
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I came to make amends.
                         
                          HECTOR
           So make 'em, loudmouth !
                         
          Full shot of the building. Very typical L.A. architecture, looking
          almost like a movie set. Anderson and Hector are leaning against
          the bannister of one of the upper galleries.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I just spoke to Bill Capa. This license plate might belong
           to our mystery lady.
                         
          Close up on Anderson and Hector. Anderson gives to Hector the
          piece of paper Bill had given to him. Hector reads the paper.
                         
          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill runs to the door of the house. He knocks repeatedly and
          forcefully.
                         
                          BILL
           Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! It's Dr. Capa again.
                         
          Edith Niedelmeyer opens the small panel in the door. She looks
          furious.
                         
                          EDITH
           You leave me alone ! Get away from here !
                         
                          BILL
           I need your help, please !
                         
                          EDITH
           Why are you torturing me like this ?
                         
                          BILL
           Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please !
                         
          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Edith closes the small panel. Several heavy blows on the door,
          which eventually crashes open and gives access to Bill.
           The house is very heavily decorated.
                         
                          BILL
           I need you to listen to me ! My best friend was killed. He
           was stabbed with a knife...
                         
                          EDITH
           You get out of my house !
                         
                          BILL
           ... 38 times in the chest !
                         
                          EDITH
           You-You go away!
                          BILL
          He follows her through the sitting room. They arrive near a bay
          window, behind which we can see a large swimming pool.
           Another patient was bled to death ! I think that I might be
           next !
                         
                          EDITH
           Go away !
                         
                          BILL
           I don't have anywhere else to go, Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! What
           are you hiding from me ? What is it ?
                         
                          EDITH
           Nothing.
                         
                          BILL
          Why won't you tell me the truth ?
          Edith picks up a cordless phone on a table. Bill tears the phone
          away from her hands.
           Put that phone down.
                          EDITH
           I'm calling the police !
                         
                          BILL
           Put the phone down ! Put the phone down !
                         
                          EDITH
          She falls on the armchair in which Bill has pushed her.
           Please ! What kind of twisted creature are you ? I've never
           done anything to you.
                         
                          BILL
           My patient Richie is involved...
                         
                          EDITH
           Why in God's name are you doing this horrible joke ?
                         
                          BILL
           If you just help me...
                         
                          EDITH
           Richie Dexter is dead ! He killed himself four years ago.
                         
                          BILL
           Why ?
                         
                          EDITH
           Because he couldn't stand... what my husband was doing to
           him.
          She gets up goes to the window bay and open a glass door. She
          leans against the frame of the door.
           He hung himself with a belt. He was 12. I didn't know ! I
           mean, how could I know ? Nobody knew.
                         
                          BILL
           What about the family ?
                          EDITH
           He is survived by his brother, Dale. If Richie Dexter were
           alive today... he'd be 16 years old. He also had a sister,
           Rose.
                         
          Bill stands still for a few seconds. He has just understood the
          truth. Then he sighs and rushes out of the house. He runs near a
          impressive mantlepiece decorated with a fierce lion head pulling
          its tongue out.
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bob's car arrives on the empty parking lot in front of Dale's
          workshop. The atmosphere is even more uncomfortable at night than
          during the day. Lightnings in the sky. There are lights evenly
          placed all along the high chimney. Several windows are lit on the
          first floor of the building.
           Bill parks the car in front of the building, gets out the car
          and runs toward the building. He enters using the door with the
          sign «Beware of dog».
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - LIVING QUARTERS - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Bill gets in the living quarters of the Dexter. It is quite dark.
          In one corner, a large kitsch statue of Christ of the Sacred
          Heart. A sink with two cabinets with glass doors..
           Bill pushes the sliding door leading to the workshop.
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill walks between statues being worked on. He bumps into a small
          cage hanging from the ceiling.
           He opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with
          spiderwebs. Something liquid drops on his hand. It's blood. Bill
          raises his head.
           Though a gate in the ceiling, he sees the crying face of Richie.
           He gets out of the small room, takes a big piece of carved wood
          on a table, and climbs the steps leading to the upper parts of the
          workshop.
           When he arrives in the upper gallery, he menacingly waves the
          piece of wood, and walks very cautiously. Richie is seated with
          his back to him. He has blood on his T-shirt.
                         
                          BILL
           Richie.
          He gets nearer and puts the piece of wood down.
           Jesus Christ !
          When he is close to Richie, he sees that his T-shirt is badly torn
          down and full of blood. He wants to touch it, but Richie starts
          moaning. Bill kneels near him.
           What did he... What did he do to you ?
                         
                          RICHIE
          He can hardly talk, and stammers even more than usual.
           W-What I... d-deserved. Y-You shouldn't be here. Get away
           from me.
                         
                          BILL
           Richie... Richie... I have to see Rose.
          He takes off Richie's glasses.
           I need her.
          He takes off Richie's wig, and Rose's face appears.
                         
                          ROSE
          She has gone back to Rose's voice, and doesn't stammer anymore.
           Get away from me, please ! You'll make it worse !
                         
                          BILL
           Where's Dale ?
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries.
           L-I don't know, but he'll be back ! L-I don't know where he
           is.
                         
                          BILL
          He is also crying.
           Was this your idea, to become Richie ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! No ! L-It happened. It just happened.
                          BILL
           What? What happened, Rose ? Please. I need to know.
                         
                          ROSE
           When Richie died... Dale buried the body and then he said,
           "Richie, come here." And I told him, I told him, "My name
           is Rose !" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And
           he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did
           things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I
           was Richie from then on.
                         
                          BILL
           What happened to Rose ?
                         
                          ROSE
           After a while, I forgot about Rose. Then Richie got busted.
                         
                          BILL
           And you had to come to group.
                         
                          ROSE
           They were our world. They were our family.
                         
                          BILL
           But then what ? Rose started coming back ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie
           was first.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, honey.
                         
                          ROSE
           Help me, please ! Help me.
          Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers
          that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the
          armchair.
                          BILL
           Jesus! Oh, my God !
          Bill stands up.
           Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ !
          He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and
          start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer.
           That crazy bastard !
          With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail.
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries and yells.
           Oh, God !
                         
          Bill gets the nail off. Rose can't breathe anymore. Her eyes are
          rolling upwards.
                         
                          BILL
          He feels that she is going away from him.
           Rose !
                         
                          ROSE
          She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering
          again.
           Get away f-from me!
                         
                          BILL
           Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone !
                         
                          ROSE
          Still talking like Richie.
           I never get to be out a-anymore.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose. Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
          Rose's head stands up : she is gone back being Rose.
           And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift.
          Bill takes off the other nail.
           It did. It did.
                         
                          BILL
           I know. Come on, let's go.
          He helps her to stand up, and then to walk.
           Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here.
          They start going down to the workshop.
           Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
                         
          We hear the sound of a nail-gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of
          metal near them.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh !
                         
          Several nail-gun shots. Nails are getting stuck in the various
          wooden objects around them.
                         
                          DALE
          Shot from behind Dale. He holds a nail-gun and keeps on shooting
          nails.
           Back up!
          He sticks a nail in Bill's shirt. Bill remains nailed against a
          carved wooden panel.
                         
                          ROSE
          She yells and holds Bill tightly.
           No ! No, Dale, don't !
                         
                          BILL
           Get back ! Get back !
                         
                          ROSE
           Dale, no !
                         
                          DALE
           Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor.
          Bill tries to take the nail off. The nail must have gone through
          his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt.
           Deadly.
                         
          Dale raises his nail-gun slowly, but Hector appears from behind a
          wall, holding a «real» gun.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it
           in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun !
                         
                          BILL
           What are you doing here, Martinez ?
                         
                          HECTOR
          He talks to Bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes
          away from Dale.
           Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out !
           That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let
           that be your psych lesson for the day !
                         
          At the end of his sentence, Hector slightly turns his head toward
          Bill. Immediately Dale shoots him. Hector bends down a little
          because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot Dale. But Dale is
          faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood
          panel.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He yells.
           Go ! Run !
                         
                          BILL
           Go ! Get over there ! Get over there !
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! No !
                         
          Dale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in Hector's
          fingers.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go !
          Bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. He runs away with
          Rose.
           We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase,
          we hear an engine starting. Then a whole block of shelves falls in
          front of them. We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on
          the controls of a handling machine.
           Bill moves Rose away from him...
                         
                          BILL
           Let's go!
                         
          ... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls
          down, stuck under the furniture.
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! Get out !
                         
          Dale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his
          neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the
          belt across the workshop.
                         
                          DALE
           Come on ! Come on !
                         
          He puts him inside a metal cage. He ties the belt on the top of
          the cage. Bill tries, with both hands to move the belt away from
          his throat.
                         
                          BILL
           You fucking son of a bitch !
          Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on
          the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up.
           You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little
           brother killed.
                         
                          DALE
           No !
                         
                          BILL
           You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.
                         
                          DALE
           No, I saved him !
                         
                          BILL
           You knew what was happening...
                         
                          DALE
           I didn't know !
                         
                          BILL
           Because it happened to you before !
                         
                          DALE
           Would you goddamn shut up ?
                         
                          BILL
           Could have saved your little brother, but he killed
           himself.
                          DALE
          He is getting angry.
           Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !
                         
                          BILL
           You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie !
                         
                          DALE
          He calms down and smiles.
           Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart,
           but I put a stop to that.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, you did.
          He coughs.
           Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?
                         
                          DALE
           Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't
           keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and
           pushin'. Huh ?
          While talking, he keeps on switching his saw on and off.
                          BILL
           Why'd you do it, Dale ?
                         
                          DALE
           Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking
           out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after
           night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her...
           gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed
           old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good.
           - And now...
          He starts his saw. Sparks spring up on the edge of the cage.
           I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.
                         
                          BILL
          He snickers.
           The inspiration of madness, Dale.
                         
                          DALE
           The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.
                         
          He starts his saw again, and slowly moves it close to Bill. We
          hear the sound of the nail-gun and a nail gets stuck in Dale's
          shoulder. The saw stops. Dale walks back a few steps to face Rose,
          holding the nail-gun pointed on him.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie.
                         
                          ROSE
           My name is... My name is Rose.
          He rushes on her. She shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of
          his forehead. Dale falls down. Rose starts screaming.
           No ! No !
          Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to
          her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn't work. She
          tries again. It still doesn't work. The gun must be empty.
           No !
          Bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but Rose, after she has
          thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop.
           No !
                         
                          BILL
          He runs after her.
           Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose !
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - CHIMNEY - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Rose starts climbing the ladder mounted on the body of the
          chimney. Bill follows her and yells.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose !
          Rain is soaking both of them, but they keep on climbing. Thunder
          is rumbling.
           A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill
          climbing on it.
           Wait ! Rose!
                         
                          ROSE
          She sobs.
           Don't !
                         
                          BILL
           For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose !
                         
                          ROSE
          She has reached the circular platform on the top of the chimney.
          She yells.
           No !
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! Stop !
                         
                          BILL
          He reaches the platform.
           No ! No. No !
                         
                          BILL
           Wait !
                         
                          ROSE
           Why ?
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! No ! Stop, please !
          Rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform.
           Just stay there !
                         
                          ROSE
           It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back.
                         
                          BILL
           If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why would you do that ?
                          BILL
           Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die.
           Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in
           dying. Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, Capa.
                         
                          BILL
           Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
          She puts her hand out to Bill's strutted hand. We hear the sound
          of a high gust of wind, and Rose looses her balance and starts
          falling backward.
           L... No...
                         
                          BILL
           No !
                         
                          ROSE
           Capa !
          She yells.
           No !
                         
          Bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the
          platform. His momentum makes him swing and he catches Rose's arm
          just as she was falling from the outer ring. With his other arm he
          holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth. They
          eventually reach the chimney ladder. Rose grabs one of the rungs,
          followed by Bill, who pushes her up.
                         
                          BILL
           Come on.
                         
          They move back to the platform, and, as soon as they reach it,
          they hug each other very tight. Bill looks at the beacon on the
          top of the chimney. From white, the beacon becomes red, which is
          its real color. Bill smiles : he sees red again. He hugs Rose even
          more tightly.
                         
                          HECTOR'S VOICE
          While the camera pans away from the platfom, showing the whole
          platform with Bill and Rose holding each other, we hear Hector's
          voice.
           Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils ! You gonna leave me
           hanging here all night, huh ?
          Bill starts laughing.
           Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! Get me some fucking
           Band-Aids !
          Bill keeps on laughing. Rose starts laughing too.
           Come on, you fucking daffodils ! Get me out of here !
                         
                         CREDITS
                         
          During the credits, we hear the following song :
                         
           WORDS OF THE CREDITS SONG
           You and I - Moving in the dark - Bodies close But souls

	INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY

	The hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is
	speaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is
	a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
	FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
	TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
	pointing device.  We see her from a considerable
	distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and
	assured.

				HELEN
		Our society creates these socially
		and psychically disenfranchised
		men, and their revenge on society
		is terrible.  They are hard to
		catch.  They are "the nice guy next
		door," their employers -- if they
		work at all -- find them quiet and
		uncomplaining.  Early abuse and
		rejection have taught them
		passivity.  Only in their violent
		fantasies do they feel alive.  What
		they seek in their frenzied
		assaults on their victims is relief
		from passivity.  For these men, ten
		minutes relief is worth far more
		than the life of another human
		being.  Torture, the pain they
		inflict, the screams of the victim,
		are all part of the ritual that
		gives them a brief respite from
		their own psychic pain.  And then
		the depression, the forgetting, the
		feeling of sadness and despair
		begins the cycle all over again.
		Like addicts seeking their drug,
		Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
		Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
		seek out their next victim.

	During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera
	has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
	balcony railing.

	CLOSEUP: HELEN

				HELEN
		The cycle is endless until they are
		caught.  And they are caught by
		chance -- they run a red light, and
		a body is in the trunk.  A leaking	
		pipe brings a plumber to a basement
		where they is the smell of death.

	Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
	the balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.

	HELEN'S POV:

	Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
	MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
	arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.

	HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:

	Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly
	alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
	exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the
	wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
	attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...

	Their POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
	there.

	HELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:

				HELEN
		At any time, right now, as you
		listen, the FBI estimates there are
		30 to 35 serial killers stalking
		their victims.  The serial killer is
		a plaque that must be addressed not
		only by the law, but by science.
		Florida spent eight million dollars
		to execute Ted Bundy.  It would
		have been better spent building a
		forensic penal facility devoted to
		research.

	Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
	that the smiling man is not there...

				HELEN
		Confined for life, without parole,
		and subjected to scientific study,
		these men's lives might finally, in
		some small measure, educate and
		thereby protect society.  Thank
		you.

	Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are
	carefully casing the crowd.

								CUT TO:

	LATER:

	The crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
	ladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes 
	as well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
	THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
	DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...

								CUT TO:

	INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY

	THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks
	around.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He
	hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.
	Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to
	stand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the
	high heels to a stall several doors down.

	CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:

	And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
	ankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from
	view as

	HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper
	around the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise
	makes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is
	just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES
	DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.

	Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently
	yanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.

	CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears
	the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He
	reacts...

	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED

	The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
	hook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)

				COP (o.s.)
		Doctor Hudson?  Are you okay in
		there?

	The MAN lets slip a little slack.

	HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,
	get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
	scream.

	CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous
	sounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for
	a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now
	there is more SOUND from inside...

	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	COP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder
	we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at
	her throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
	toilet seat.

	COP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we
	see a broom closet door opening.

	HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a
	second, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,
	his gun still in his hand.

	RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at
	HELEN.

	COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions
	in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,
	the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

	STAGE AREA

	The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.
	HELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.

								SLAM CUT:

	INT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

	As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try
	desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now
	pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her
	eyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

				HELEN
		Andy!  Andy!

	She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
	FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
	hall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...

	INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

	The room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it
	is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)

	HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO
	HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,
	where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)
	The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm
	herself with the sound of her own voice...

				HELEN
		It is October twelfth, 1994 in the
		city of San Francisco, California,
		U.S.A., the strongest, richest,
		most stable and happiest country in
		the world.  That is the sole place
		of life in the universe.  Under
		God.

	CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,
	others scattering from the nervous haste...

	CLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
	tosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard
	reflection with a certain detachment...

				HELEN
		Good God.  What happened to you?

	She barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will
	herself from near-hysteria to relative calm...

								CUT TO:

	HALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.
	She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.
	Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The
	other shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the
	screen comes a command.

				CHESSMASTER
		'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam
		move.'

	She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a
	move.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
	computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.

				CHESSMASTER
		'Lousy move.  Not really into this
		game, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've
		got a feeling about you.  Let's
		meet.  Like a date.'

	HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.

				HELEN
		'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your
		life.'

				CHESSMASTER
		'Another romantic dream gone all to
		hell.'

				HELEN
		'Maybe it's better to just dream
		on; avoid the disappointments of
		life.  Come on, move.'

	She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window
	curtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the
	T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us."  She crosses to
	the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.

	VIEW:

	A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The
	morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.
	HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the
	air, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream
	horror of the night...

	O.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.

	CLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
	handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.

				HELEN
			(carefully)
		Yes?
			(listens)
		You son-of-a-bitch!  Son of
		a bitch...

	Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.

				HELEN
		You filthy... son of a bitch!

	On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
	move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:

				COMPUTER
			(filter)
		You Queen is in check.
		Protect your Queen.

	OVER CREDITS:

	HOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is
	morning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in
	a long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly
	near the end of a satisfactory run.

	THE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY
	SLOW MOTION.  WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
	AT WORK HERE.

	NOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S
	OPEN-MOUTHED DEEP BREATHING LOOK LIKE

	A SCREAM!

	END TITLE AND CREDITS:

	INT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY

	MUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST
	DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...

	THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;
	centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the
	shoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES
	FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none
	in the circle.

				M.J. (V.O.)
		My third grade teacher at the
		convent shot better than that.

	THE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.

				RUBEN
		Yeah, but she had divine guidance.

	We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.
	HALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking
	young woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.
	appears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,
	thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
	sergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
	sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
	even smaller and younger than she is.

	RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior
	in authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored
	and laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his
	belt.

	M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,
	AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.

				M.J.
		I'd feel a whole lot safer with
		Sister Loretta for my backup.  Look
		at this guy: you shredded him!

				RUBEN
		Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me
		now.

	The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back 
	to shooting position.

				M.J.
		It's sloppy shooting.  It's in
		character, Ruben, but unnecessary.
		And bad for your career.

	RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the
	circle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.

				RUBEN
		I've been practicing.  Now can I
		kiss your tummy?

	M.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.

				M.J.
		Perp's holding a hostage, the
		shoulder on his gun hand is gonna
		be exposed.

	SOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her
	fire.

				M.J.
		Answer it.

				RUBEN
		I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't
		you at least interested in which
		one it is?

	She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he
	answers, she raises her gun and aims...

				RUBEN
			(into phone)
		I'm here, where are you?...
		Heeeeyyy!  What a surprise!  No.  On
		duty, have to call you back... You,
		too, you too.  My God, you made my
		day.

	He hits the "end" button...

				M.J.
		You hit the brachial nerve...

	SHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,
	inside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY
	IN THE MIDDLE!

				M.J.
		You're good enough you'll never
		have to kill anyone.  I joined the
		cops to save lives, not waste them.

				RUBEN
		You know, M.J., when I watch you
		shoot, I realize I've got a little
		problem with my stance... could you
		just move over here and critique my
		legs?

	He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.
	She is unloading her weapon...

				M.J.
		The problem is between your legs.
		You told your shrink about that?

	She is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...

				RUBEN
		I tell my shrink about you,
		Sergeant.  I tell him you're the
		top cop of my dreams.

	Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which
	he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks
	one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...

				M.J.
			(putting away her
			 gear)
		Don't take that mess in the car.

	They're on the move; as they go away from us...

				RUBEN
		He's in love with you already...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

	They pull up in front of an apartment building in the
	Pacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the
	thick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"
	is already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.
	A couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN
	SCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay
	M.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...

				M.J.
		Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already
		here.

	She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak
	of a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.

				RUBEN
		Hey.  And there's the Haircut right
		behind.  If she stops short he's
		gonna be there feet up her ass...

				SUSAN
			(on camera)
		Inspector, can you...

				M.J.
		I just got here myself, Susan.

				SUSAN
		...confirm this third murder adds
		up to a pattern?  Do we have a
		serial killer on the loose in the
		city?

				M.J.
		I just got here.  Talk to you
		later...

				M.J.
			(as they escape behind the
			 barrier tape)
		What the hell does she want to do,
		scare everybody to death?

				RUBEN
		That's her job... Jesus, Quinn is
		here already.

	QUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide
	stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.
	As they climb up toward him...

				QUINN
		I been waiting... I have to do
		everything myself.  Photo, crime
		tech, the Coroner are already
		inside.  The Landlady calls it in;
		tenant is not answering when
		called, she sticks her head in,
		sees the body, uses the deceased's
		telephone to call 911.  Otherwise
		nothing disturbed.  It's all yours,
		kid.  I'll take care of the Mouth
		and the Haircut.

	M.J. and Ruben enter...

	INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY

	Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;
	at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman
	chain-smoking (the Landlady).

				M.J.
			(to cop)
		That the Landlady?
			(to Ruben)
		You wanna talk to her, Ruben?
			(back to cops)
		Who was first on the scene?

	Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben!

				MIKE
		I was.

				M.J.
			(forcefully)
		I'm over here?  What's your name,
		Officer?

				MIKE
		Michael Johnson.

				M.J.
		You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up
		anything?  Use the doorknob?  I
		don't want to find your prints on
		anything later and you tell me you
		forgot to tell me.

				MIKE
		No.  I didn't.

	She glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I
	DIDN'T."  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	The same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair
	still in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and
	pushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one
	leg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is
	slightly posed, but casual, relaxed.

	Bending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE
	MEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.

	M.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.
	Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is
	finishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's
	men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between
	them; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the
	body.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO
	THE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.  
	
	ON M.J.:
	
				DOC (V.O.)
		Liver and rigor are telling me
		about eight hours.  I'm gonna take
		her out now if it's alright.

				M.J.
		I'm seeing ligature marks on her
		neck here, petechial hemorrhages in
		her eyes.  Strangled.

				DOC
		You got it.  Same as the other two.

	THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

				COP (V.O.)
		Tell whoever she can't come to the
		phone, she's all tied up.

	Nobody laughs...

				M.J.
		That's real old material, get a new
		writer...

	She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding
	it in tissue someone hands her...

				M.J.
		Hello?

				PHONE VOICE
			(extremely cheerful)
		Hello!  This is Geena Martinez, how
		are you this morning?

				M.J.
		What is this about, Ms Martinez?

				PHONE VOICE
		I'm conducting a telephone survey
		to determine whether you're
		satisfied with your insurance on
		your personal valuables...

	M.J. gently hangs up the phone.  She has been looking at the
	Dead Woman... They pick up where they left off.

				DOC
		He used something soft, like a
		stocking or a bathrobe tie.

				M.J.
		Anybody find it?

	No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin
	lifting the body out of the tub.  M.J. takes one last look
	into the dead woman's eyes...

				M.J.
		Cover her up, please.

	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes.  M.J.
	approaches Mike... takes him aside...

				M.J.
		Mike.  Why don't you tell me what's
		bothering you?

	Mike is acutely uncomfortable.

				M.J.
		Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out
		and sooner is a hell of lot better
		than later.

				MIKE
		Well, there's something missing in
		there.  There was something around
		her neck when I came in there, but
		it's gone now.

				M.J.
		Who came in after you?

				MIKE
		Lieutenant  Quinn.

	She seems relieved.  Brightly:

				M.J.
		Well, it's all right, then, Mike.
		Thanks.

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

	In the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the
	scene; Ruben appears behind her.  The photographer is coming
	out...

				M.J.
			(to Photographer)
		Get me good faces on the crowd
		here.  Get a couple of harness bulls
		to grab anybody who starts to
		run...

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Don't tell your Grandmother how to
		suck eggs.  I only been doing this
		work since your junior prom,
		darling...

	But M.J. is already on to other things.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

	CLOSE ON A FOLDED NEWSPAPER THAT LIES ON THE FLOOR FIVE OR
	FIX FEET FROM THE DOOR TO HELEN'S APARTMENT.  HOLD DOOR IN
	B.G.

	The door opens and Helen looks out, wasted from cognac and
	Xanax.  She looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look
	of despair.

	HELEN'S POV

	The newspaper lies there, out of reach.

	HELEN

	As she stretches out her foot toward the paper, can't reach
	it.

	POV.  As she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia
	manifests itself: DISTORTED VISION THAT MAKES THE HALL
	STRETCH AND THE WALLS TAKE ON EXAGGERATED PERSPECTIVE;
	SICKENING -- VERTIGO!  The newspaper seems further away.

	HELEN  She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further
	into the hall...

	POV.  The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her.
	The newspaper melts like a Dali watch.

	HELEN sweats.  She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward
	the newspaper... and with a supreme effort grabs it and
	squirms back inside.

	INT. APARTMENT - DAY

	As she slams the door shut on the hall, and sits gasping for
	breath.  After a moment she can bring herself to look at the

	POLICE BAFFLED IN DEATHS OF THE WOMEN

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Damn fools!

							CUT TO:

	INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

	QUINN is watching a portable TV screen with profound distrust.
	Onscreen is SUSAN SCHIFFER.

				SUSAN
		... continues to stonewall the
		public.  Now...

	There is a knock, but before QUINN can respond, M.J. enters.

				M.J.
		You messed with the scene.

				QUINN
		Shut up.

	He and M.J. both listen to SUSAN.

				SUSAN
		... third Bay Area woman has been
		strangled, but the police continue
		to deny that this is the work of
		one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn
		declares that the murders will be
		treated as unrelated crimes, unless
		new evidence...

	M.J. TURNS OFF THE TV, FACES QUINN...

				M.J.
		You messed with the evidence.

				QUINN
		I tagged the goddamned stocking.
		It ain't lost.  We're sequestering
		that evidence.  That's the trap some
		son of a bitch is going to fall
		into...

				M.J.
		Am I in charge of this thing?  Or
		not.

				QUINN
		I said you were...

				NH
		Then I decided what evidence we
		choose to sequester.

				QUINN
			(a beat here)
		Okay.  What do you want to
		sequester?

				M.J.
		The stocking around the neck.

	A long moment of looking at each other.  Then...

				QUINN
		You didn't say serial killer and I
		didn't say serial killer.

				M.J.
		Right.

				QUINN
			(not satisfied she
			 really means it)
		This is the anniversary of the
		summer of love and your city
		fathers have declared a Festival of
		Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of
		Commerce don't want TV announcing
		killers on the loose.

				M.J.
		Right.

	And she starts to go...

				QUINN
		We're gonna have a bunch of clapped
		out old hippies blissing on the
		Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the
		park, smoking dope and sticking
		tulips up their ass.

				M.J.
			(exiting)
		Good.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

	This large room is very busy, many officers at work.  Known
	sexual offenders have been rounded up.  False confessors add
	to the crowd.  Detectives who are not dealing with these
	people are making and taking calls.  At this desk, a tall
	intense looking Detective, NICCOLETTI, interrogates a false
	confessor, a man who looks like a businessman...

				NIKKO
		Harvey, I don't want you in here no
		more, making false statements...

				CONFESSOR
		They are not false.  We pay for
		city government like this, you
		don't even care about the truth?!
		I killed her in the bathtub.

				NIKKO
		Why?

				CONFESSOR
		Because she was dirty, a dirty
		girl!

				NIKKO
		How?  How did you do it, Harvey?

				HARVEY
		With a knife?

				NIKKO
		Good guess, but not good enough.
		Get the fuck outta here...

	He has stood as M.J. passes coming from Quinn's office.  He
	falls into stride with her through the crowded scene... He
	is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general
	hygiene checkup...

				NIKKO
		What am I wasting my time with this
		shit for?

				M.J.
		Because it's your job, that's all.

				NIKKO
		Not what I meant; why me?

				M.J.
			(cutting)
		Maybe it's something you did in
		this life, Nikko...

	It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished
	argument... He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart.

				NIKKO
		Got me.  That really hurt!  You...

	Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away...

				M.J.
			(to Ruben)
		Get Mercer to run the medical,
		dental, legal bills, laundry and
		dry cleaning receipts, extermin-
		ators, mailmen, grocery and
		drugstore deliveries, handymen,
		plumbers...

				RUBEN
		It's mostly done, they got nobody
		in common, the three of them... No
		mutual friends -- the Landlady says
		nobody was ever there, she never
		saw her with anybody.

	They are approaching PACHULSKI'S desk.  PACHULSKI is on
	phone.  Pachulski is looking at M.J., grinning...

				PACHULSKI
			(into phone)
		Yes, ma'am, I know.  You can't talk
		her right now... because she's 
		busy, she's all tied up.
			(sotto to M.J.)
		Deep Throat's back.

	He hits the speaker phone...

				FEMALE PHONE VOICE
		This is the third one.  You've got
		a serial killer here.  When are you
		going to start warning people?

				PACHULSKI
			(whispering)
		Fourteen calls from this broad.
		And she ain't stupid.

	M.J. signals for GIGI to trace the call.  Takes the phone,
	switches off the speaker...

				M.J.
		Who is this?

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

	HELEN on phone

				HELEN
		Who is this?

				M.J.
		Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm
		in charge here.

				PACHULSKI
			(amused)
		Ask her about the moon bike.

				M.J.
		I'm really interested in your
		ideas.  The moon bike.  What is
		that?

				HELEN
		What is wrong with you people?
		The first two, I thought he might
		be on a lunar cycle because they
		were 28 days apart, but obviously
		not.  This new one is only two
		weeks.

	Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on M.J., M.J.
	not so much... Gigi signals they're getting it.

				HELEN (cont'd)
		You want to joke about moonbikes?!

				M.J.
		No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And
		neither is tying up telephone lines
		to police with crank calls while
		people in trouble are trying to get
		through for help.

				HELEN
		You're calling me a crank?

				M.J.
		Do you have any evidence to report,
		ma'am?  Do you know any of the
		victims...

				HELEN
		I think this is number three...

				M.J.
			(over her)
		That's an opinion, not evidence...

	Gigi hands her a slip of paper... M.J. reads it... glares
	at Pachulski who is still laughing.  M.J. knows the name on
	the slip of paper...

				M.J.
			(covers the phone)
		Helen Hudson.  Get Ruben back
		here?

	As she turns back to the phone...

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	HELEN, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same T-shirts
	she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains
	looking down at the street.  She hears a code knock, then a
	key turns in the lock.  She moves to greet ANDY her
	assistant and friend.  ANDY is laden down with groceries and
	mail.  HELEN immediately reaches a hand up to touch his
	face...

				HELEN
		Where were you?  Don't tell me.
		It's just under seventy, right?  The
		sun is strong but the air is dry
		and fresh...

				ANDY
		Would you please get your hands off
		my face, Tallulah?  What happened
		to the newspaper?

	He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her.
	When she rejects it, he takes it for himself.

				HELEN
		I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

				ANDY
		Well!  Aren't we the daring one?
		What's morbid and ghastly enough in
		the news to make Doctor Helen set
		foot outside her door?  The antenna
		is gone off her car again.  I had
		no music, all the way to the
		market.  Let me find a garage for
		it?

	They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff...
	expensive goodies...

				HELEN
		I've told you:  I can't afford to
		garage it.

				ANDY
		Are you kidding?  You buy enough
		gourmet junk every week... most of
		which rots... to garage a fleet of
		stretch limos.

				HELEN
		I had the dream again.
			(beat)
		And I got another call.  This time
		he spoke.  He said "You and me, you
		and me."

				ANDY
		A little heavy breathing is what
		most of us yearn for.  Forget it.

				HELEN
		He whispered, but it was him!  I
		know it was him!

	Andy now stops to address this seriously...

				ANDY
		He can't phone you unless the
		warden gets an okay from you.  Did
		you give him an approval?

				HELEN
		Andy?  When a three-year-old says
		there's a monster under the bed,
		you don't say 'forget it'.  You
		look under the bad.
			(beat)
		I'm three years old.  Call the
		prison.

	Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it
	breaks his heart.  He puts his arms around her.

				HELEN
		Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

				ANDY
		When was the last time you washed
		your hair?

				HELEN
			(shaky, but trying)
		Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my
		coiffure?

				ANDY
		Monsieur Andy can smell your
		coiffure.  And guess what else?

	He pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...

				ANDY
		Cellulite.  What do you say I
		blindfold you and take you to the
		gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

	HELEN AT WINDOW

				HELEN
		Andy?

	Andy has heard this tone before:  panic attack alert.

				ANDY
		Here we go again.

	ANGLE AT WINDOW TO INCLUDE THEIR POV OF STREET

	In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his
	face.  Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab.

				HELEN
		You parked right behind him.  The
		one I noticed earlier.  I didn't
		say anything, I thought he'd leave.
		Just take a look.

				ANDY
		Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A
		NEWSPAPER!

				HELEN
		But earlier, he was staring up
		here.  Please, Andy.

				ANDY
		Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry'
		coming up.

	ANDY leaves the apartment.

	EXT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S BUILDING - DAY

	The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, ANDY
	peers out, sees:

	ANDY crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming
	up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver.
	THE NEWSPAPER DROPS:  IT'S RUBEN.

				ANDY
		Excuse me, but would you mind
		explaining why you're watching the
		lady upstairs?

				RUBEN
		None of your fucking business.

	Usurping RUBEN'S aggressive attitude, ANDY leans his face
	close to RUBEN'S window.

				ANDY
		Listen, asshole, I've got a gun...

	RUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the
	car.  With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up
	ANDY'S nose.

				RUBEN
		I hate this...

				ANDY
		Only kidding!

	RUBEN pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ANDY'S
	head in a deadlock.  Then he opens the door, gets out, slams
	door, forcing the squawking ANDY into a helpless frisk
	position.  We HEAR HELEN scream, (O.S.).  Ignoring this,
	RUBEN begins to frisk ANDY.

	M.J. APPROACHING IN HER OWN CAR, SEES THE ACTION, BRAKES
	FAST AND GETS OUT.

	HELEN at window, shouting.

				HELEN
		I'm calling the police!

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Andy enters, followed by Ruben and M.J., who holds up her
	badge to Helen.

				M.J.
		Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I
		apologize for Goetz, he's a
		firehouse dog.

				ANDY
			(trying to defuse)
		I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed
		it.

	Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in
	what's happening, who's who and what's what.  Helen is
	confused, fighting back fear...

				M.J.
			(trying to communicate
			 here)
		Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor
		impulse control.

				HELEN
		Is he out?

				M.J.
		Who?

				HELEN
			(to Andy)
		If he's not out, why are they here?

				M.J.
		Because of your phone calls.

				HELEN
		What calls?  I haven't made any
		calls.

				ANDY
			(to distract)
		Are you staying long?  Shall I shut
		the door?  Make your coffee?  Make
		the beds?

				M.J.
			(to Helen)
		You talked to me.  Do you remember?

	The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to
	control herself.  A beat.

				HELEN
		You were the one that talked about
		moonbikes and called me a crank?
		Oh God, I am!
			(to Andy)
		Make them some coffee.
			(to M.J.)
		Halloran, is it?  Investigator
		Goetz?  I had a crank call myself--
		he said...
			(a moment of real
			 fear)
		I thought it might be Daryll Lee
		Cullum.  I thought he might be out
		of prison.

				RUBEN
		Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think
		so.  If he's escaped we'd have the
		National Guard, cops'd be crawling
		through sewers.  You'd have a guard
		on your front door.

				M.J.
			(looking around)
		I want to tell you it's a great
		honor to meet you and talk to you.

				HELEN
		You don't admire me.  No police
		admire me.  I got one of you
		killed.  Why don't you say right
		out what you're here for?

				M.J.
		You called us, Doctor Hudson.

				HELEN
		Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control.
		The accounts of the firs two
		murders made it so clear they were
		the work of the same man, but you
		kept announcing they were
		unrelated.  You'll never catch him
		that way.

	M.J. regards her for a moment...

				M.J.
			(to Andy)
		Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take
		mine black.
			(beat)
		You're absolutely correct.  The
		politicians don't want panic
		headlines spoiling the Festival of
		Love.

				HELEN
		Well, let's thank God you and
		Inspector Goetz are on the case,
		then.

				M.J.
		Would you want to work with us on
		this?

				HELEN
		Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical
		hysteric, with panic syndrome, and
		anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm
		afraid of everything, real and
		imaginary.  I never leave this
		apartment now.  Nobody ever comes
		here.  I just wanted to get your
		attention.  I write and I used to
		lecture on these crimes, but... I'm
		not competent.

				M.J.
		I think you are.  I really admire
		everything you've done; it would be
		an honor to work with you, and we
		need all the help we can get,
		especially yours.

				HELEN
		Inspector Halloran, that is so much
		bullshit, you don't like or admire
		me, but the beautiful part is I
		don't give a fuck.  That's the
		upside of having a breakdown.

				M.J.
		Well, it's a hell of an apartment
		you got here.  I'm living one step
		away from the projects, myself, but
		I get to go to work every day,
		wading in blood and guts.  I guess
		the books you wrote about these
		sons of bitches paid off pretty
		good.

				HELEN
		Will you go.  Andy, make them go.

				M.J.
		You can't go out lecturing?  Tough
		shit.  Women are dying.  Where can
		I lay this stuff out?

	She dumps files of photos, etc., out on Helen's cocktail
	table.

				HELEN
		I don't want this.  What are they?

				RUBEN
		You called us, Doctor, if you don't
		want to look at them here, how
		about downtown.  I'll drive you
		down...

	She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up
	to leave the room.  M.J. and Ruben are both appalled at the
	force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack...

	Andy races t o the kitchen; Ruben tries to help but Helen
	fights him off viciously, gasping for air... Andy races
	back in with a PLASTIC BAG HE PULLS OVER HELEN'S HEAD AND
	FACE...  She hyperventilates into the bag...

	THE PLASTIC BAG BALLOONS OUT AND BACK IN HELEN'S FACE until
	she faints.  Andy deals with it like an everyday event,
	treating her very gently...

				ANDY
			(to Ruben)
		Now look what you did.

				RUBEN
		What did I do?

				ANDY
		You threatened to drive her
		downtown.  She has agoraphobia.

				RUBEN
		Fear of what...

				ANDY
		Open space.  She hasn't been out of
		this apartment in three years.  I
		didn't used to think it was real...

	He's making her comfortable.

				M.J.
		We'll get the paramedics...

				ANDY
		Oh, God, uniforms, more stress.
		Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting:
		she hyperventilates till she passes
		out, then her breathing goes back
		to normal, and she wakes up singing
		like a lark.
			(rocking the
			 unconscious Helen)
		We know, don't we, Princess?
			(to them)
		Give her a couple of hours.  I know
		about this.

	M.J. starts to gather up the pictures and files.  She is
	angry and disgusted.

				M.J.
		Tell her we're sorry we bothered
		her.

				ANDY
		Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you
		really want her help.  I mean if
		you really do, leave them.  Let her
		see them.  I'll see they're safe...

	M.J. takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen;
	Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos
	strewn around.  Makes a decision...

				M.J.
		Tell her to ask for me...

	She's handing Andy her card...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

	M.J. AND RUBEN come out in the street...  CAMERA IN A HIGH
	ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM...

				M.J.
		Snotty neurotic bitch...

				RUBEN
			(amused)
		Classy madonna.

				M.J.
		Sure.  She likes you, Rube.  She
		likes the way you move.  She sure
		as hell isn't in love with me.

				RUBEN
		You came in there with this
		attitude...

				M.J.
			(over him)
		Order Chinese for us and meet me
		the library?  Anything but beef.

	She jumps in her car, still steaming, leaving Ruben to move
	to his car.  AS HE MOVES CAMERA FOLLOWS, BECOMING A WIDER
	ANGLE TO INCLUDE FACADE OF HELEN'S APARTMENT.

	We can SEE ANDY, SITTING WHERE WE LEFT HIM, HOLDING HELEN IN
	HIS ARMS.  SHE SLEEPS PEACEFULLY.  DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE
	PHONE RING.  ANDY SHOWS IMPATIENCE, THEN CAREFULLY
	DISENGAGES FROM HELEN SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HER SLEEP.

	HE MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM UNTIL HE IS OUT OF FRAME.  THE SHOT
	HOLDS ON HELEN FOR A BEAT.  PHONE RINGS.

	THEN THE CAMERA PANS LEFT (OUR FIRST CLUE THIS IS ANOTHER
	POINT OF VIEW) ACROSS TO A SECOND WINDOW WHERE IT CATCHES
	ANDY MOVING UNTIL WE AGAIN DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE BUILDING
	WALL AND THE CAMERA PANS SMOOTHLY TO THE THIRD WINDOW, WHERE
	ANDY ENTERS.  WE SEE HIM PICK UP THE PHONE AND SPEAK INTO
	IT.  HE SEEMS IMPATIENT.

	THEN CAMERA PANS DOWN TO A CELLULAR PHONE, F.G. AND FOCUS
	RACKS TO E.C.U. AS A FINGER PUSHES THE "END" BUTTON.

	CLOSE: ANDY

	Putting down the phone.  Irritated...

				ANDY
		Shit...

							CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE LIBRARY - DAY

	CLOSE: AN ATTORNEY IN COURT

				ATTORNEY
		... it was your feeling after
		careful evaluation that he was a
		sexual sadist who satisfied at
		least four out of ten criteria in
		the DMS III?

	SHOW M.J. and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese
	takeout.  HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for
	Daryll Lee Cullum.  Helen sure of herself to the point of
	arrogance, which is her undoing...

				HELEN
		Yes.  Without question.

				ATTORNEY
		Without question?  He only scored
		40 percent, four out of ten
		criteria?  Couldn't another expert
		say he flunked the sexual sadist
		test?  What curve are you marking
		on, Doctor?

				HELEN
		The test criteria are only part of
		what we look at in evaluating
		subjects.

				ATTORNEY
		Only part.  What else?  What did
		you think of his claim that he tied
		this girl to the tree and set fire
		to her because Joan of Arc told him
		to do it.

				HELEN
		He was lying.

				ATTORNEY
		'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked
		you what you thought, not what he
		did.

				HELEN
		I thought he was lying.

				ATTORNEY
		You said, first, he was lying.  How
		do you know that, Doctor?

				HELEN
		Because people who are suffering
		from aural hallucinations hear
		voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee
		told me that Joan of Arc always
		appeared beside him on his left
		side and spoke softly in his left
		ear.

	Murmur of subdued laughter in court.

				HELEN
			(emboldened)
		He took pains to hide his actions
		because he knew they were morally
		wrong.  He was not acting on mad
		impulse.  He was sane and acting
		out a pattern he carefully followed
		every time.

				ATTORNEY
			(playing causal)
		What pattern was that?

				HELEN
		The same as the first time...

	She catches herself.  The D.A. has leapt to his feet, but now
	tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but
	Helen, the Attorney and the D.A. all are clearly disturbed
	by the line this questioning is taking.

				ATTORNEY
		The first what?
			(as she hesitates)
		Your Honor, she's got this far, I
		think she should finish.  I don't
		think this jury should be left
		wondering where the rest of her
		statement would lead.

				JUDGE
		I agree, Doctor.

				HELEN
		The first two murders.

				ATTORNEY
		What first two murders.  We don't
		know about them here, do we?

				HELEN
			(giving up)
		He told me he had done two others
		just like it.

				ATTORNEY
		When was that?

				HELEN
		When he was seventeen.

				ATTORNEY
		And you believed him when he told
		you he had done that.

				HELEN
		Yes.  I believed him.

	The D.A. is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge.

				JUDGE (V.O.)
		Yes, I'll accept a call for a
		mistrial.  Evidence of that other
		crime when the defendant was a
		juvenile is inadmissible and never
		should have been heard by this
		jury...

	FREEZE FRAMES.

	NOW WE SEE M.J. AND RUBEN LOOKING AT HELEN on the TV screen,
	THINKING...

	THE DOOR OPENS AND QUINN ENTERS.

				QUINN
		There was no sperm.

				M.J.
		The same as the firs two.
		Definitely a serial.

				QUINN
			(seeing HELEN on
			 video)
		What are you looking at that for?
		Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.

				M.J.
		What clues?  I'm going to work
		Helen Hudson.

				QUINN
		Would you step outside, Sergeant?

	M.J. leaves a cautiously silent RUBEN.  Once the door shuts,
	he turns tape back to 'play.'

	EXT. OUTSIDE DOOR TO LIBRARY - DAY

				QUINN
		I'm telling you.  Don't you ever
		address me publicly in that tone.
		You'll work what and who I tell you
		to work.

				M.J.
		Anybody in this department ever
		worked a serial killer case?  She's
		the expert.  I need help.

				QUINN
		How about I put Nikko on it?

				M.J.
		That's always your privilege, sir.

	QUINN snorts, starts on his way, then turns back.

				QUINN
		Sergeant?

				M.J.
		Yessir.

				QUINN
		You ever reflect how this big
		explosion in dead women coincides
		with the flowering of women's lib?

				M.J.
		Yessir.  I have reflected on that,
		sir.  Which explains my gushing
		deference to you, sir.

	QUINN is somehow cheered by this little exchange.

				QUINN
		Nikko's looking better by the

				ANDY
		No, dear.  You're at your best with

				HELEN
		I want to die.

				ANDY
		I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you

	HELEN grins, and ANDY starts to tickle her, she laughs.

				ANDY
		You thought he was cute too, didn't
		you?  Admit... admit...

	HELEN now laughing a little too hard.  Suddenly the laughter
	changes to tears.

				ANDY
		What?  What'd I do?

				HELEN
		Reminded me that I used to be
		attractive.  That men used to want

				ANDY
		You slut!  No sexy young cop for

	She clings desperately to him.  He rocks her as he would a

				ANDY
		When are you going to call them?

				HELEN
			(big beat)
		About what?

	ANDY PRODUCES THE FILE M.J. LEFT WITH HIM.  Helen looks at

				HELEN
		I can't, Andy.

				ANDY
		Then, why don't you just die.  I'm

	He exits.  After a moment fighting her fears, Helen reaches
	for the file.  She opens it and looks at the first picture.
	THE PHONE RINGS.  She freezes... Panic hangs in the air...
	Andy answers the phone in the kitchen...

				ANDY (O.S.)
		Yes?  Inspector Halloran, she's
		going through the material now.

		She'll call you... No, she'll be

	INT. POLICE LIBRARY - NIGHT

	M.J. scanning microfilm newspaper & magazine clips.

	'COOL KILLER CULLUM'
	CONS COPS IN ESCAPE FROM CUSTODY

	Slew police bodyguard in attack on expert witness

	M.J. hears NIKKO entering, looks up, gives him a half-smile,
	returns her attention to the microfilm.

				NIKKO
		Working late.
			(no response)
		You're a damn fool.

				M.J.
			(preoccupied)
		Oh, I know.

	"ANOTHER ATTACK!"
	"HUDSON VICTIM OF BLOODY ATTACK.  BODYGUARD SLAIN!"

				NIKKO
		You're almost ten years older than
		he is.

	M.J. turns off the microfilm.  The last headline is retained
	on screen:

	"ESCAPE KILLER CLAIMS NEW VICTIM"

				NIKKO
		It's none of my business anymore...

				M.J.
		You got that right, Nikko, it's
		none of your business.

				NIKKO
		You're shitting ion your career.  You
		outrank hi...

	M.J. looks at him at last with wry amusement: he's jealous 
	of Ruben?
	
				M.J.
		Well, you outranked me, Nikko.

				NIKKO
		Yeah.  And you used that. Used me

				M.J.
		Don't put yourself down like that.
		I never used you.  I worked my way
		up like a marine grunt!

				NIKKO
		Yeah, you did that too.  You earned
		what you got; don't shit on it,
		that's all I'm saying.

				M.J.
			(maddeningly)
		God, you're cute when you're mad.

	The door opens and RUBEN enters, instantly takes in the
	scene:  M.J. sitting in front of a stalled machine, NIKKO,
	looming over her.  After an awkward beat, NIKKO heads for
	the door.  Ignoring RUBEN, he barks at M.J.

				NIKKO
		Think about it.

	RUBEN regards M.J., who busies herself examining the other
	tapes.

				RUBEN
		What's wrong with him?

				M.J.
		He's just mad he let me keep the
		espresso machine.  We heard from
		Doctor Hudson?

				RUBEN
		Nada.  Lemme make the call.

				M.J.
		Honest to God, Ruben!

				RUBEN
		I like women like that!

		Tell it to your shrink.

	SHOOTING HELEN'S PLACE, IN THE PARK, ETC.:  A YOUNG
	RED-HEADED WOMAN, wearing shorts and an open-necked shirt,
	kneels on the grass, weeding a lush flowerbed.  The CAMERA
	SWISHHPANS TO the back door of the house as a man comes out
	balancing a tray with drinks.  The woman gives the man a

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

	CLOSE UP:  early crime scene photos.

	WE SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FIRST TWO MURDER VICTIMS, SO
	WE SEE THE PATTERN HELEN DESCRIBES AND ANALYZES.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		The way he's posed the bodies...
		he's flaunting his power to do
		whatever he wants to her.  This
		man... He probably seems perfectly
		normal.  These murders are organized
		and planned.

	WE ARE NOW SEEING THE ROOM:  M.J. AND RUBEN, HELEN AT A TABLE
	IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES.  Helen picks out one
	picture from the rest...

				HELEN
		Except for this one.  You put that
		one in to test me.

	M.J. nods, pleased with HELEN>

	INSERT: THE PICTURE.  The victim's body is covered with
	bruises.  But, unlike the others, her face has been covered.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Is it an ongoing case?

	BACK TO SCENE...

				M.J.
			(nods)
		For months... last October.

				HELEN
		It was a lover or a husband.
		Someone close.  Somebody who knew
		her and cared about her.

				M.J.
			(glancing at Ruben)
		How do you know that?

				HELEN
		He felt remorse.  He covered her.

	HELEN arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.

				HELEN
		The bodies have been carefully
		arranged... different positions,
		but somehow the same.  The
		positions are brutal... yet
		quite... artful.  It's like... a
		signature.  He's proud of his
		accomplishments.  There are early
		Picassos and late Picassos, but you
		always recognize the hand.  He
		wants us to recognize his hand.
		I've seen this hand before... what
		are you hiding?

				M.J.
			(taken aback)
		Nothing.

				HELEN
		Where are the stockings he
		strangled them with?

				M.J.
		How did you know they were
		stockings?

				HELEN
			(sarcastic)
		I sent Andy out on murder missions.
		For God's sake -- it's the Boston
		Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used
		their own stockings to strangle
		them.  Tied in a bow-knot.

	She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to
	pictures of deSalvo's victims:  they are identical...

				HELEN
		Somebody is imitating his m.o.
		Look for a plumber or carpenter or
		handyman; that's how deSalvo got in
		the door and caught them off guard.

				RUBEN
		The Boston Strangler, when was
		that...?

				HELEN
		In the sixties.  He's dead --
		stabbed to death in prison.

				M.J.
		Why imitate a dead serial killer?

				HELEN
		If you knew why, you might know
		where to look for him.
		I don't envy you this; he's not
		done -- he's going to do them faster
		and faster to keep the adrenaline
		rush.  Now, I've done what you 
		asked me.

				M.J.
		Work with me.

				ANDY (O.S.)
		It's good for you.

	They are startled by his appearance!  A little unsettling.

				ANDY
		It's good medicine.

				RUBEN
		A little homeopathic cure for the
		willies.

				HELEN
			(exhausted)
		None of you know anything about it.
		Now go.  And Andy, if you persist
		in playing doctor, leave, with
		them.

				ANDY
		I'm the only friend you've got,
		darling, and I don't intend to stop
		doing what I think is good for us.

				HELEN
		Get out!  All of you!

	Andy helps M.J. and Ruben scoop up the files...

				RUBEN
		You said you don't give a fuck and
		that's the beauty of a breakdown?
		This doesn't look like not giving a
		fuck, you know that?

		Aw, Jesus.  The Mouth gets a load

		around the world.  deSalvo redux.
		The matter, you think they don't
		teach Latin in Catholic schools?

				M.J.
		Don't swear at me because we got
		problems.  I'm just giving you the
		news.  I went to a Catholic school;
		I'll tell you what they teach.  On
		the knuckles they teach.

				QUINN
		Who've I got to beat up except the
		messenger?  Does this give us
		anything to go on?

				M.J.
		I'm checking out anybody who lives
		like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests
		for rape, especially by a man
		wearing green.  Checking out
		psychiatric hospitals for his
		personality profile.  Cross check-
		ing names from arrests for sexual
		offenses, public fondling.  If
		they've got a German wife.  We can
		keep cops working on this kind of
		junk for years, and this guy's
		going to hit again, soon.

				QUINN
			(morose)
		I know.  Get out here.

				M.J.
		So.  Do we tell the media and hope
		for somebody to come forward with
		information?

				QUINN
		Or for some new nutcase to copycat
		the copycat.

				RUBEN
		What I love, the big fight, some
		girl, she drops the quarter on her
		boyfriend so the bastard spends the
		night in custody, just to teach him
		a lesson.  We'll get a shitload of
		those.

				QUINN

		No.  We're keeping it quiet, don't

	Engrossed in her own chess game, she does not notice the

	Hands, feet, breasts, hair of two bodies mixed mischievously

		It's a game they like to play.

		I am not going to look at any more

				M.J.
		I don't look at pictures.  I look
		at the real thing.  I don't feel
		infected.

				HELEN
		Maybe that's why you can't catch

		the red-headed woman in my

				M.J.
		I just came from her... here's what
		you haven't seen.

	M.J. takes out a picture of the dead RED-HEADED WOMAN.  Her

				M.J. (cont'd)
		A forgery of the Mary Sullivan
		murder scene, he's done it perfect.
		Except for the sign.

				HELEN
			(looking at photo)
		She probably let him in the door

		mothers?!  Where are the mothers
		that are supposed to teach them to
		be wary and to tough and not afraid
		to fight?

				M.J.
		Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the
		Festival of Love?  You make any
		sense in that?

	HELEN stares at the picture.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's
		talking to you.

				HELEN
		It's anybody connected to author-
		ity.  They write, they even knock
		on your door.  They're fans.  It
		thrills them to flirt with getting
		caught.

				M.J.
		Nobody knows you have anything to
		do with this case; nothing has been
		on TV or the news... Why would he
		want to get in your computer?

				HELEN
		Because I'm his damned pin-up girl!
		His, all of them!  They know me.
		They're in prisons with libraries,
		they collect clippings, I'm their

				HELEN
		Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You

		Look out for her.  She's tougher

	He goes...

				HELEN
		I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest
		of it?

				RUBEN
		MaryJane.  We call her M.J.

				HELEN
		MaryJane.  You think that logic and
		police procedure, order and science
		and method will hold back the
		horrors of a world gone mad and the
		sickness of the night.  I did once.
		But you know how he'll get caught?
		He'll have an accident, or some cop
		will get lucky.  You can't catch
		him by being intelligent and
		working hard.  Or the worst:  there
		are dozens of women slaughtered in
		the most horrible way, month after
		month.  The news stories grow more
		grotesque and bizarre and in the
		city people lock their doors and
		windows, and hurry home before
		dark.  And then, one day, there are
		no more.  What happened?  Did he
		just stop?  Get tired and disgusted
		and decide not to kill any more?
		Did he kill himself?  Did he die in
		an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or
		get sick and die?  It's like the
		murderer walked off the edge of the
		earth.  And you never know.  But
		you keep asking yourself -- when you
		read about a new murder -- is he
		back?

	M.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's
	story.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...

				M.J.
		That's amazing.  A whole new book,
		thought up in a minute.  Very good.
			(beat)
		All I know how t do is get up,
		take a shower, and go to work.
		Hope, if he does another I'll nail
		the son of bitch, and they'll spell
		my name right in the newspaper.
		Where is Andy going?

				HELEN
		He's going home.  He slept over
		because I was a little anxious...

				M.J.
		I want a guard on you.  I'm worried
		about leaving you alone.

				RUBEN
			(to M.J.)
		We're through for the night, aren't
		we?  You go on.  Get some sleep.
		I'll stay until we can get a man
		out here and maybe catch a cab
		home.

				HELEN
		That would be much appreciated.
		Thanks.

				M.J.

		Somewhere down the line we're doing

	frame, doesn't move.  RUBEN continues to extend his hand
	with the card in it.  It is a charged moment.  She is frozen
	in the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.
	HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,
	determined not to have any further mortification this night,
	she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.
	Then a second step and a third.

	Her hand touches the card, takes it.

	She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.
	What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has
	quietly and efficiently closed.  The door is locked.
	Frantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.

	HER POV:

	RUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just
	turning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first
	narrows, squeezing her in, then expands.  She is lost in the
	miles and miles of space between the two walls.

				HELEN
		Oh, God!  Help me!

	RUBEN reappears, races toward her...

				RUBEN
		Tell me what to do!

				HELEN
		I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

	She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN
	catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like
	a suspect.  He puts one hand on the back of her neck,
	spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position.  Somehow, this
	is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown
	panic...

				HELEN
		...falling... FALLING!

	He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring
	her against the feeling of free-fall.

				RUBEN
		I'm right here.  I won't let you
		fall.

	He still has a hand on the back of her neck.  Suddenly, the
	proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck.  She
	begins to hyperventilate.

				HELEN
		Don't let go... I can't breathe...
		I'll die!

				RUBEN
		Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe.
		I'll fix it...

	RUBEN takes out his gun...

				RUBEN
		Put your hands over your ears.

	RUBEN shoots off the lock.  Then he picks HELEN up and
	carries her back into her apartment.

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw
	up over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it
	to her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
	water, then watches her take the pills.  After which he
	takes the bottle and pockets it.

				HELEN
		The lock...

				RUBEN
		I'll get a locksmith.

				HELEN
		Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid
		to sleep... I don't want...him...in
		my head...

	RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa.  As her eyes
	close, RUBEN comforts her.  TV features the antics of a
	nervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.

	CLOSE UP HELEN:

	We hear a faint but impatient voice call:

				V.O.
		Peter... Peter...

							CROSS FADE TO:

	INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT

	Dim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not
	comfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.
	She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks
	older.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
	DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and
	video, on which a movie's final credits are running.

	THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON

	PETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.
	Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
	his hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts
	the tape on 'eject.'

				WOMAN
		Put in the Kevin Costner.

				PETER
		Why don't we save it for later?
		It's almost time for Letterman.

				WOMAN
		You know I don't like to watch talk
		shows by myself.  Where're you?

	He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he
	approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a
	lock of hair back from the forehead.

	She ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE
	DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.

				WOMAN
		See, now you've annoyed her.  You
		know she doesn't like you to touch
		me.
			(to dog)
		Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve
		you so much!
			(to Peter)
		Did you feed her?

				PETER
		Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's
		hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

				WOMAN
		She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed
		her?

				PETER
		She lies all the time.  Why would I
		say I fed her if I didn't?

				WOMAN
		That's what I don't know.  Why
		would you lie?  That's the
		problem... I can't understand why
		anyone would lie.

	He leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
	to her dog over the TV soundtrack.

				WOMAN (cont'd)
		You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would
		you?  Just to get Dad in trouble?
		Such a naughty widdle dog...

	HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
	small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,
	then through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the
	basement door behind him.

	THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets
	and computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a
	small TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,
	freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
	outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.

	PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
	something to turn the video back on.

	The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is
	the YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a
	table, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,
	but not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being
	asphyxiated by slow degrees.

	PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to
	repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
	toward his wife.  He whispers:

				PETER
		Didn't I promise I'd come right
		back?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN

	ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of
	glorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves
	down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom
	of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A
	few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new
	CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a
	number of unmarked cars.

	RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.

	As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH
	THE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S
	stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns
	away.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.

				RUBEN
		Up all night with a sick friend.

	NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

				NIKKO
		You dumb son of a bitch!  You don't
		even know how to treat a woman.

				RUBEN
		Who?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to
		me why she gave you the boot...

	He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
	WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is
	now tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath
	a sign that says "NO DUMPING".  The usual technicians,
	photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.

				RUBEN
		Is Niccoletti assigned here?

				M.J.
			(angry about it)
		Quinn decided we should form a task
		force -- they're all one case, now.
		He wants all the senior detectives
		on it...
			(to Doc)
		She wasn't killed here.

				DOC
		Not likely.

	M.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels
	beside her... to Ruben...

				M.J.
		Tell me what you see.

	He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.

				RUBEN
		She didn't fight back, no hair or
		skin under her fingernails.  I'm
		not seeing any bruises or
		contusions...

				M.J.
		What about her arms?

				RUBEN
		Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at
		this...

	Nikko appears, looming over her...

				NIKKO
		Probably so stoned she never knew
		what got her.  Like Goetz's sick
		friend.  Right Goetz?

	They ignore him.  M.J. stands...

				RUBEN
		She's blue as hell.  No marks on her
		neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same --
		no ligature marks.  Outdoors...

				M.J.
		Look at her legs.

				RUBEN
		Spread out like she was sexually
		assaulted here.

				DOC
		After she was dead.

				RUBEN
		She was dragged up here from the
		road, you can see the tracks.  She
		was already dead or unconscious.
		Let's get plaster casts on any --
		all footprints.

				M.J.
		If this is just the dump site,
		where did he do the job?  Where did
		he pick her up?

				NIKKO
		Doped up kids all over town.  Park
		was full of them last night.  Very
		easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

	Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes
	Ruben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between
	them.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...

				M.J.
		What the hell are you doing?  The
		Mouth and the Haircut are right
		down there, thank God they didn't
		see that.

	Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-
	of-Lovers.

				M.J.
		Niccoletti, they're on the wrong
		side of the tape, you want to push
		them back?  Now.

	Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for
	RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow
	her back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the
	hillside to their cars...

				M.J.
		Ruben, my God, I ought to put you
		on report.

				RUBEN
		You're right.  I can't stand that
		bastard.  Sorry.
			(getting back to
			 work)
		This is something new.  Not the
		same guy, that's for sure.

				M.J.
		Yeah, everything's different.

	But she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:

				M.J.
		Get the pictures, and casts of
		footprints.

				RUBEN
		Look at him, grandstanding...

	Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff...

				M.J.
		That's all we need...

	She strides toward them...

				M.J.
		Detective Niccoletti?

				SUSAN
		What's this about the Boston
		Strangler, M.J.?

	M.J. looks at Nikko.  He should know better.  She's also
	thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at
	this point -- or not?

				M.J.
		Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on
		the wrong side of the tape.  We're
		still trying to find any footprints
		or tire marks and we don't want to
		chew up the ground, okay?  I'll
		talk to you later.
			(to Nikko)
		You, too.

	She's got Susan outside the tape...

				SUSAN
		Inspector, will you confirm
		somebody is copying the Boston
		Strangler?  This is the fourth, is
		that correct?

				M.J.
		We're going to review all the
		evidence carefully before making
		any statement...

	She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other
	side.  Susan races for her silver Audi...

				M.J.
		Ruben, put the light on...

	From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm
	clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.

	M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster
	car, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,
	trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the
	familiar San Francisco chase scenes.

				M.J.
		Now listen up, Ruben.  You never,
		never, never mess with somebody
		inside the case!

				RUBEN
		Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  What do
		you...

				M.J.
		You damn well better start working
		on that impulse control.  A woman
		who is implicated in this case?
		Someone who's practically a piece
		of evidence?

				RUBEN
		It's against your rules that I try
		to help a witness who's scared
		shitless?  Who's...

				M.J.
		The woman's unstable.  You could
		wind up with a harassment charge.
		Anything.  You're like some horny
		little teenager.

	M.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view
	mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
	tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.

				M.J.
		Anybody who's ever watched TV knows
		about that corner.

	Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

				M.J.
		Everybody could see you -- unshaved,
		same clothes from yesterday,
		reeking of sex.

	RUBEN'S eye-brows lift.  She peels into the HQ parking lot
	and jumps out.

				M.J.
			(going away)
		Park the car.  Call the lab.  Get
		Doc to lean on the coroner for a
		really fast prelim on the sperm.

	RUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...

				M.J. (O.S.)
		When you get it, call me.

	RUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.

				RUBEN
		She loves me.

	INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

	QUINN, NICCOLETTI.

				QUINN
		I know; the kid hit you first.  He
		already told me.

				NIKKO
		He's not treating her right...

				QUINN
		She left you, Nikko.  She's not
		your responsibility.  She takes
		very good care of herself.  If she
		wants to romance the kid, it ain't
		your business.  Your business is to
		snap out of it.

				NIKKO
		We were together six years, sir!

				QUINN
		Don't give me six years!  You never
		divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd
		you expect from M.J.?

				NIKKO
		She knows I'm Catholic!  She never
		mentioned divorce!  Not once!

				QUINN
		Then you shoulda known she wasn't
		buying.  She was just long-term
		leasing' you.
			(beat)
		Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare
		twenty-second twitch, there ain't
		nothin' about sex I don't hate.
		But of course, I'm Irish.
			(beat)
		Plus I got real problems.  I'm
		worried I might have to put you in
		over M.J.  There's something going on
		here, the Commissioner is targeting
		her now, I can't leave a woman in
		that position.  But the thing is,
		how can I move you in, if you go on
		acting like a teenage asshole?

				NIKKO
		I don't want the job.  Don't do
		that to her.  She's worked too
		damned hard for it.

				QUINN
		What's going down with the sting in
		Chinatown?  That gonna be off your
		plate in a week or what?

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

	A ROOM IN THE BASEMENT OF THE POLICE HQ IS BEING SET UP TO
	HOUSE A NEW TASK FORCE, WITH CATERER'S TABLE FOR TEMP
	DESKS.  Bulletin boards with notices and pictures; telephone
	techs are still installing phones, cops are learning
	unfamiliar computer menus, etc.  M.J. IS EXAMINING HUGE
	BLOWUPS OF ONLOOKERS AT CRIME SCENES PINNED UP ON A WALL,
	WITH A MAGNIFYING LENS.

				QUINN (V.O.)
		Sergeant...

	She walks away BECKONS, BECKONS, COME ON, WALK AFTER ME!  He
	walks out of a door and they stand on the steps...

	EXT. STEPS POLICE HQ - DAY

	A couple of Cops, maybe male and female, are smoking there.
	Quinn gives them a look that sends them scuttling inside,
	flipping their butts into the shrubbery.  Quinn sighs and
	digs out a cigarette.  The looks between them tell the story
	of his trying to give it up and not being able to, etc.

				QUINN
		So what have we got?

				M.J.
		It's not the same guy.  It should be
		a self-solver.  No bow around the
		neck, left and body outdoors,
		completely different.  The others
		were housewives, secretaries, he
		talked his way inside, killed them
		in their own living room or bed- or
		bathroom.  This one didn't have a
		husband or a boyfriend, no family,
		temp waitress, 3 arrests for
		misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI,
		asphyxiation probably from a
		plastic bag over her head.  Sexually
		assaulted.  The others weren't
		molested that way.  We're waiting
		for the sperm tests...

				QUINN
		Christ.  How old are you?  You sure
		you want to be in this line of
		work?

				M.J.
		You're damn right I do.

				QUINN
		Okay, now what about your sidekick
		punching my favorite detective?
		What the hell is going on?  You got
		no discipline in your operation.

				M.J.
		I'm sorry it had to come to your
		attention.  I am dealing with it.

	She starts to go...

				QUINN
		Where you going?

				M.J.
		Helen Hudson...

				QUINN
		What the hell you need her for?

		Because I think I'm wrong.

	CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  SHAKING HANDS DUMP OUT PILLS.  FOUR.

	HELEN: RAVAGED.  WATCHING HERSELF IN MIRROR AS SHE GULPS THE
	REMAINING PILLS.

	DOOR BELL RINGS O.S.

				HELEN
		I'm not seeing anybody.

	We HEAR muffled voices -- ANDY and M.J.  HELEN, as she
	realizes Andy is letting M.J. in, goes to the bathroom door
	and tries to slam and lock it: Andy beats her to it,
	blocking with his foot in the door.

				HELEN
		You're fired.

				ANDY
		I know.  Do come and meet your
		guest.

	M.J. appears.  Taking in Helen's condition -- due to a wild
	night with Ruben?  Helen moves from the bathroom down the
	hall to her office, as...

				M.J.
		We've got another one.

				HELEN
		That's no surprise.

				M.J.
		But it's a different m.o.

				HELEN
		Then what do you need me for?

				M.J.
		She was killed somewhere else and
	dumped outdoors in an empty lot.
		Where it says "no dumping."  Her
		legs pulled apart in a kind of
		sexual pose.   It's all different
		but it seems so -- the same.
		Artificial and posed... Something's
		wrong with it.

				HELEN
		You're saying it's the same man,
		but he's changed his style?  That
		doesn't happen.  These men are
		robotic; the murder is like a
		ritual.  The method itself is part
		of the pleasure...

	They've turned into the office.  Something is wrong...

				M.J.
		Who turned off the Internet
		computer...

				HELEN
		I turned it off.  It's like an open
		window he can climb right in...

				M.J.
		He comes in the window, we maybe
		grab him.  Where's the on-switch?

				HELEN
		Have you got a warrant?  Get the
		hell out o here!  This is the
		only space I have left in the
		world!  Why can't you leave me out
		of it?

				M.J.
		Helen -- the killer directly
		contacted you.  His interest in you
		is intense.  I'm worried about you.
		I don't want to lose you.  I know
		this stirs up every monster under
		the bed, but this is the only
		direct contact we have with him.
		The only chance we have to trap
		him.
			(beat)
		So, you can turn Internet back on,
		or I do, and we put somebody here
		on a 24 hour shift and you can
		kick, scream and hyperventilate.

				HELEN
		That little Winona Ryder manner...
		you're more convincing as Clint
		Eastwood.

				M.J.
		Clint is putting a guard on you.
		But if you swear to leave the

	HELEN has to laugh.  The laugh turns to a hacking cough.

				ANDY

	THE PHONE RINGS.

				HELEN
		Hello?... Oh...
			(a beat)
		...yes, she's right here.

	HELEN hangs the phone to M.J.  The air is a little more

		Ruben.

				M.J.
		Hello, Ruben...
			(listens, nods)
		So that's that...

				HELEN
		Please thank Inspector Goetz for
		taking care of me last night.

	M.J. delivers the message straight-faced.

				M.J.
		Ruben, Dr. Hudson wants me to
		thank you for taking care of her
		last night.
			(hangs up)
		Lab report on the new one.  At

		There were two kinds of sperm.  The

	Helen has come alert...

				HELEN
		She was near a sign that said "No
		Dumping?"  Two kinds of sperm --
		the lab said one was a secretor and
		the other was not?

	M.J. mumbles a surprised yes.  Helen is at computer.

				HELEN
		There were needle marks.  But no
		drugs in her blood.

				M.J.
		So far nothing they test for comes

	Helen has a Window type screen: she clicks icons...

				HELEN
		Is that it?

				M.J.
			(stunned)
		That's exactly... I could have
		taken that same picture, this
		morning.

	A RATHER GRAINY PICTURE OF A DEAD GIRL SPREAD OUT IN A
	SUGGESTIVE POSE IN AN EMPTY FIELD.  A SIGN RIGHT BY HER SAYS
	"NO DUMPING."

				HELEN
		He's switched from DeSalvo to the
		Hillside Strangler.  The Strangler
		was two men, that's why there are
		two kinds of sperm.  His idea of a
		joke, very witty our boy.

				M.J.
		That's not consistent... You said
		they never changed their style,
		they're robots...

				HELEN
		Consistency is the hobgoblin of
		little minds.  Tell them to test
		for the chemicals found in Windex.
		That's a product for cleaning
		with...

				M.J.
		I know Windex, for God's sake, I
		clean my own windows...

				HELEN
		It's what Bianchi and Buono
		injected into one of their victims.

				M.J.
			(sensing something
			 appalling)
		Injected Windex!  Why would he
		switch to a new m.o.?

				HELEN
		Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half
		way to nailing him.  Serial killing
		is irrational and rigid and 
		compulsive.  This guy has a plan
		all thought out, flexible and
		complex.  He's playing a game with
		us.  Who will he imitate next?
		Maybe he's doing all the serial
		killers in history, the great
		innovators, the murderers' hall of
		fame.  Just to prove he's better
		than all of them.  They got caught;
		he didn't.

				M.J.
		He'll get caught.  If he has a plan
		that'll be what trips him up...

				HELEN
		Who's going to catch him?  You?
			(beat)
		And if you do, there'll be another
		one.  And one after that.

				M.J.
			(gently, surprised)
		You're afraid of him.

				HELEN
		This one, yes.  I was always
		curious about these twisted little 
		souls, but this is the first one
		I've felt personally terrified of.
		He's something new and unheard of.

	'KOPYCAT KILLER?'

				SUSAN
		...to mimic the M.O. of the Boston

		It was backstage at the McClusky

	She zaps the remote and a program hyping the Summer of Love
	comes on...

	INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	We see on HIS computer screen a picture of HELEN scanned
	from some newspaper or magazine.  PETER is building a morph:
	beside Helen on screen is another image -- of the RED-HEADED
	woman.  He is placing marks on one picture, on the exact
	corner of Helen's left eyes.  As he does so, a red dot
	appears near the corner of the left eye of the Red-headed
	woman.  Both pictures are dappled with similar dots.  It
	looks very odd, as though someone had stuck Post-its all
	over the images.  Around him, as he works are other pictures:
	ASPHYXIATED GIRL taken while she was strapped to the table.
	Of the sign "NO DUMPING."  M.J. leaving Helen's!  HE ALSO HAS

	workstation where she takes the phone from Ruben...

				M.J.
		Halloran.

	INTERCUT:

				HELEN
		You betrayed me!  Now every
		psychopath in the city knows I'm
		back in business... You lied to me!

				M.J.
		I did not; the Mouth -- that's what
		we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on
		her own.

				HELEN
		Why should I trust you?

				M.J.
		Because I'm all you've got.

	RUBEN HAS BEEN GIVEN NEWS: BIG PROBLEMS.  MEN AND WOMEN ARE
	GETTING UP, PUTTING ON HOLSTERS, ETC., MOVING OUT...

				HELEN
		How could you...

				M.J.
			(out of patience)
		I like the real smart Helen Hudson
		a lot, I'm Goddamned sick and 
		tired of the hysterical little
		girl, Helen.  You asked your way in
		-- I don't forget that.  You've got
		a nickname around here -- "Deep
		Throat" from all the phone calls, I
		wonder if you know that.  Go take a
		xanax, I've got to got to work.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN, her police scanner sounding distant tinny cries in
	the night:  Helen holding the phone, digesting that...

				SCANNER (VARIOUS VOICES)
		987...  Carol Meany, call your
		home?  We have...  don't step on
		me, damn it!  Go to channel 8...
		Code Red -- Homicide at 16th Avenue
		and Horgan, woman dead in car.  Can
		we have homicide?  All units go to
		channel 5.  Leave channel 3 clear
		for homicide... etc.

	EXT. HELEN'S STREET - NIGHT

	A MAN parks a car.  He gets out.  He is dressed entirely in
	black.  Glancing around to be sure he is not observed, the
	MAN moves to cars, banging them hard with his hand until he
	SETS OFF A CAR ALARM.  He trots silently to HELEN'S side of
	the street and merges into the dark side of her building.
	THE ALARM GOES INFURIATINGLY ON.  A light comes on in an
	upstairs window...

	INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	BURT, the cop on guard, marginally irritated by the car
	alarm, looks up briefly, then returns to his magazine.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RICHMOND DISTRICT - NIGHT

	CAR WHERE A WOMAN HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD.  KLIEG LIGHTS PAINT
	HER FEATURES A BLEAK WHITE ON BLACK.  M.J. and RUBEN work
	the scene along with the CRIME TECH CREW.

	One of the TECH GUYS holds up a bullet.

				TECH GUY
		Pulled this out of the door, it's
		bigger than a .38; it's a .44 or 9
		millimeter.

	CLOSE: M.J. is crawling along the floor, looking at
	everything she can find -- gum wrappers, hobby pins, loose
	change, etc.  She lifts her head and finds the car radio and
	tape player right in her face.

				M.J.
		Was this on?  When you found the
		car was the tape player on or off.

				COP (V.O.)
		It was on, auto-reverse, over and
		over.

	M.J. has rubber gloves on.  She switches on ignition and the
	tape player starts:  ABBA.  A phone rings...

	ON RUBEN standing beside the car; he answers his phone...

				RUBEN
		Yeah?... I can't talk now...
		What?... No.  There's no sexual
		assault, it's a drive-by, a woman
		in a car, it's not him.
			(mouths to M.J.)
		Helen.

	M.J. still pissed at the earlier phone call, turns away,
	dismissively...

				HELEN (V.O.)
		It's a woman shot in a car?

				RUBEN
		Yes.  I have to go...

				HELEN
		She on the passenger side?

				M.J.
			(shouting to be
			 heard)
		Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on
		with his work...

				HELEN
		What's that music.  It's Abba.  I
		can hear it.  It's Abba.

				RUBEN
		What's Abba?

				M.J.
		Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too
		young.

	Dread clouds HELEN'S face.  She is calling up databases,
	screens scrolling across her computer monitor.

				HELEN
		Don't hang up!

				RUBEN
		What?...

				HELEN
		Listen to me.  Is there a gas
		station nearby?

	RUBEN look around, sees a gas station across the street and
	further down the block...

				RUBEN
		Yes.

				HELEN
		Is there a phone booth there?

				RUBEN
		They all have one...

				HELEN
		Go and look for a note.

	RUBEN hands the phone over to M.J.

				RUBEN
		She wants me to check the phone
		booth for a note.

				M.J.
		Helen... excuse me, we...

	ON HELEN'S SCREEN IS THE FACE OF BERKOWITZ... SHE CALLS UP
	ADDITIONAL FRAMES SHOWING SCENES OF HIS CRIMES.

				HELEN
		She was listening to Abba in her
		parked car when she was shot with a
		Bulldog .44.

	M.J. reacts:  the scene of what Helen is saying hits her
	hard.  This is repeating the pattern of yet another
	killer...

				M.J.
		Tony!

	The techie who pulled the bullet out of the door turns...

				M.J.
		Let me see the slug outta the door!

	He pulls a baggie out his pocket and hands it to her...

	RUBEN RUNNING across to the gas station.  He's alone now,
	the blazing lights of the crime scene recede.

	EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	A small annoyed crowd has gathered around the are whose
	alarm is still shrieking.

	INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	BURT finally gets up, goes to window, sees situation,
	decides to go and fix it.

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

	M.J. still on phone to HELEN.  She's just got the bullet out
	of the baggie; Tony stands watching.

				M.J.
		What's that siren?

				HELEN (V.O.)
		One of those goddamned car alarms.
		What's going...

				M.J.
		Ruben's gone to look... It's banged
		up but it looks like a .44.  It's
		Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?

				HELEN
		Look in the crowd.  He liked to
		hang around and watch the cops at
		work...

	EXT. SHELL STATION - NIGHT

	Closed.  RUBEN at the phone booth.

	A note lies on the shelf, handwritten in felt-tip pen.  He
	puts on a rubber glove, picks note up by one corner.

	CRIME SCENE:

	RUBEN has taken phone back from M.J.  He is reading the note
	to HELEN.  M.J., agitated, stands by.

				RUBEN
		"Police: let me haunt you with
		these words:  I'll be back."

	M.J. notices that there is writing on the other side of the
	note.  She forces RUBEN'S gloved hand to turn note over.

				RUBEN
		Hold on a minute, Helen...

	By this time M.J. has seen that this part is addressed to
	HELEN.  M.J. takes phone from RUBEN, forcing herself to
	sound casual.

				M.J.
		Helen, Ruben's going to drop by.
		He's got some questions.

	She hangs up, RUBEN is already on his way.  M.J. calls a
	number...

				M.J.
		Answer me!!...

	EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The beeper on Burt's belt is beeping, but his head is under
	the hood of the car where the car alarm is blaring.  He
	can't hear the beeper...  

	BACK TO CRIME SCENE:

	M.J. ends the call, yells to another Detective.

				M.J.
		I need a unit at 19809 Lorenda
		Drive.  Tell them to approach code
		2 and wait for instruction.  Find
		the goddamn officer supposed to be
		on security.  Ruben's on his way.
		He'll go in alone.

	SHE TURNS AND SEES:

	BEHIND YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE THE NIGHT IS FULL OF THRILL
	SEEKERS AND CURIOUS.  WHICH OF THEM MIGHT BE THE KILLER?
	THE GUY IN THE BACK OF THE CROWD WHO FOR NO APPARENT REASON
	SUDDENLY BEGINS TO RACE ALONG BEHIND THE ONLOOKERS?  THE MEN
	WHO DUCKS TO TIE HIS SHOE WHEN A PHOTOGRAPHER SHOOTS A
	PICTURE?

	INT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The horn blares across the street, (O.S.).  No one notices
	the MAN at HELEN'S door, swiftly fiddling the lock with a
	ring full of burglars' keys and picks.

	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN is putting on makeup (Ruben is coming).  A small but
	alarming noise at the front of the loft.  She listens
	carefully, and moves to the door looking down the hall
	toward the front door.  It is OPEN"  Burt is not there!

	She hesitates a moment, then turns off the lights and
	sprints for the front door, to escape.

	INT. LIVING ROOM

	THE MAN IS PULLING A BALACLAVA UP OVER HIS FACE.  AS HE HEARS
	HER HE STEPS TO THE...

	INSERT: TELEPHONE

	A HAND IN A FINE LEATHER BLACK GLOVE LIFTS THE RECEIVER OFF
	THE HOOK.

	HELEN RUNS DOWN THE HALL AND REACHES THE FRONT DOOR.  SHE
	RUNS RIGHT OUT INTO THE HALL A FEW STEPS BEFORE RECOILING:

	HER POV.  THE WALLS AND FLOOR WEAVING AND CONTRACTING...
	AGORAPHOBIA HAS HIT.

	HELEN FALLS.  SHE SCRAMBLES IN TERROR BACK TO THE "SAFETY"
	OF HER WALL, NOW A CAVE OF DARKNESS.

	SHE FALLS ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL, GASPING FOR BREATH.

	LIVING ROOM.  THE MAN MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM TOWARD THE
	HALL.

							CUT TO:

	RUBEN:  taking the hills fast.

	THE MAN: STEPS OUT INTO THE HALL.

	HELEN:  SHE HAS RUN BACK THE LENGTH OF THE HALL TO HER
	OFFICE.  SHE IS JUST VANISHING AS THE MAN STEPS TO WHERE HE
	CAN SEE HER.

	THE MAN STARTS TO FOLLOW, NOT FAST, BUT WITH TERRIFYING
	SURENESS...

	THE POLICE SCANNER SUDDENLY COMES UP LOUD.  HE HESITATES.

	HELEN:  HER REMOTE CONTROLS IN HAND SWITCHES ON TV SETS,
	LAMPS, ETC.

	THE MAN:  HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN, TOWARD WHERE HE BELIEVES
	SHE IS.  HE IS PASSING A WINDOW, WHEN THE CURTAINS SUDDENLY
	DRAW, RIGHT BESIDE HIM.  HE PAUSES AGAIN, LOOKS DOWN AND WE
	AND HE/WE SEE THE STREET SCENE: BURT AND NEIGHBORS TRYING TO
	SILENCE THE CAR ALARM.  THEN HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN.

	THE CURTAINS CLOSE.

	HIGH ANGLE OVER THE MAZE OF THE APARTMENT WALLS.  WE CAN SEE
	THE MAN MOVING ALONG THE HALLWAY AGAIN -- TOWARD ANDY'S DEN,
	AND DIRECTLY TOWARD WHERE WE LAST SAW HELEN.

	SUDDENLY, FOREGROUND, HELEN'S HEAD POPS UP, HUGE!  SHE IS
	WRESTLING HERSELF UP OVER THE WALL TOWARD CAMERA, INTO
	ANOTHER ROOM OUT OF HIS PATH.  WE PAN WITH HER AS SHE WIGGLES
	HERSELF OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND UNTIL SHE FALLS INTO
	FURNITURE, MAKING A HUGE NOISE.

	MAN STOPS, TRYING TO LOCATE DIRECTION.  HE DECIDES.  LEAPS
	WITH CATLIKE GRACE ONTO A PIECE OF FURNITURE AND FROM THERE
	ONTO THE TOP OF THE WALL!

	NOW HE STANDS ON THE PARTITION, LOOKING AROUND AT THE
	GROUNDPLAN (AS IT WERE) OF THIS APARTMENT MAZE FROM A HIGH
	ANGLE POV.

	HELEN:  SHE CROUCHES IN HIDING.  IN DEEP FOCUS, BEYOND HER,
	AND HIGH ABOVE HER, WE SEE THE MAN SILHOUETTED AS HE BEGINS
	TO WALK ALONG LIKE A CAT ON A GARDEN WALL, ABLE TO SEE ON
	BOTH SIDES INTO WHATEVER ROOMS HE IS PASSING.

	HE DROPS OFF THE WALL FOR A MOMENT INTO HER BEDROOM.
	INTERCUT MAN AND HELEN.  HE LOOKS FOR HER, PRODS THE BED
	COVERS.

	THEN LEAPS BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL.

	SHE TAKES A VASE AND THROWS IT OVER THE WALL INTO THE
	ADJACENT ROOM.  THE MAN'S FIGURE DOESN'T EVEN SLOW, HE'S
	ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT:  HE LEAPS CLEAR ACROSS AN OPENING
	ONTO THE WALL THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO HER.

	SHE HITS THE REMOTE:  THE CURTAINS SWEEP OPEN, AND MORE LIGHT
	COMES IN NOW FROM THE STREET.

	CLOSE, THE MAN: HIS FACE TURNS TO THE LIGHT: FROM THIS HIGH
	ANGLE WE AND WE SEE DOWN INTO THE STREET, WHERE

	RUBEN'S CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP.  RUBEN charges into the
	building.

	BURT, COMING AWAKE, FOLLOWS RUBEN up the stairs three at a
	time.

	HALLWAY AND APARTMENT DOOR:  THE MAN COMES RACING OUT AND
	TURNS TOWARD THE STAIRS, JUST AS RUBEN REACHES HELEN'S
	FLOOR.  THE MAN TRIES TO DO A 180, BUT RUBEN THROWS A BODY
	BLOCK AND THE MAN FALLS BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

	LIGHT FROM HALL GIVES US OUR FIRST LOOK AS RUBEN TEARS THE
	BALACLAVA OFF HIS FACE.  He is a middle-aged Afro-Asian with
	a knife-scarred face.

				MAN
		I can explain!

				RUBEN
		The fuck you can!
			(shouts)
		Helen!  Are you okay?  HELEN!

	Then he sees her.  In shock, she stares down at the MAN.

				RUBEN
		Did this animal touch you?

	She shakes her head, turns and runs out of the room, as
	RUBEN catches sight of BURT.

				RUBEN
		Turn on a light and call in the
		unit.  NOW!

	BURT rushes to okay.  RUBEN FRISKS THE MAN.

				MAN
		No gun!

				RUBEN
		Bullshit's gonna get your balls
		stomped on!  What's your name?

				MAN
		Chow.  Conrad Chow.

	The improbability of this name makes RUBEN deliver an angry
	kick to the man's side.

				MAN
		Swear to God!  Conrad Chow.  Never
		carry a gun.

				BURT
		Backup's here...

				RUBEN
			(to Burt)
		Then you get your ass outta here, I
		don't wanta see you again...

				CONRAD
		I brought a present for the lady,
		there.  I'm looking for her, to give
		her the present...

				RUBEN
		You break into her apartment to
		deliver a gift?  Where is it?

				CONRAD
		The door was open, swear to God,
		I'm just looking for her when you
		come charging up the stairs...

				RUBEN
		Where is it?

				CONRAD
		I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the
		lady's pillow...

	Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands.

	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruben comes running in, sees a parcel lying on pillow... 
	scoops it up, and rips it open.  It's a book.  He returns
	to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police.  Ruben holds the
	book up like a question.

				CONRAD
		Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that
		book, he wanted the lady to have
		it.  They won't let him send it to
		her, so I'm getting out, he asks me
		to deliver it in person, he says,
		put it on her pillow.  It has all
		about how he tried to kill her.

				RUBEN
		He told you she was loaded, any-
		thing you could steal you could
		keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself
		a return ticket to Quentin,
		breaking and entering.

				CONRAD
		The door was already open...

				RUBEN
		We know...
			(to a cop)
		Send the book to evidence...

				CONRAD
		She's supposed to have it.

				RUBEN
		She don't want it.

	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her
	chest.

				RUBEN (V.O.)
		Helen?  Open the door.  The guy's
		nothing.  A burglar.

	She sits there, says nothing.

				RUBEN (V.O.)
		Open the door.  Please.

				HELEN
		Why don't you shoot off the lock?

	She starts to laugh.  The sound is awful.  After a moment,
	she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door.  RUBEN takes
	her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it.  Wets a
	washcloth, goes to sponge off her face.  She is trembling.

				HELEN
		He was in my apartment!

				RUBEN
		I know, baby.  I know.

	Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,
	she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down
	the hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around
	her.

				RUBEN
		It's okay... you're safe with me!

	He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight
	around her, holding her still.  He smoothes her hair, rubs
	her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.

				RUBEN
		When I was a little kid, and I'd be
		in a state, my father would hold me
		on his lap, until all the fight
		would go out of me...

	She breaks free and whacks him across his nose.

				HELEN
		You think you're my Daddy?

	There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that
	RUBEN kisses her.  She goes limp, kisses him back, then
	she's suddenly sobbing.  His nose is bleeding, but she's
	smiling.  Something between them has finally connected.
	Been agreed upon.

				RUBEN
		Helen...honey, you know I gotta go.

	He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.

				RUBEN
		You know how to use this?

				HELEN
		They taught me at the FBI.  I was
		very good at it.  It scared me... I
		liked it.

				RUBEN
		You take it, hang on to it, it'll
		make you feel safer.  Stay put.

				HELEN
		What else?

	He goes.

	A SONG BEGINS, PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES:  "MURDER BY
	NUMBERS" BY THE POLICE...

		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art..."

	HELEN OPENS THE WEAPON, SEEMINGLY COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HANDLE
	IT WELL, AND EMPTIES OUT THE BULLETS.  SHE LOCKS IT UP AND
	HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF.

	THE SONG CONTINUES...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	THE FBI ARRIVES.  High angle, looking down: three identical
	cars draw in front, park with military precision: all four
	doors on the all three cars open at the same time and
	identically dressed men, in suits, get out, slam the doors
	in sync., and march toward the front steps to HQ, ignoring a
	couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk...

	INT. POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS

	As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down
	the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing
	a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
	continue away from CAMERA down another corridor.  Through
	the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
	pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between
	cops and FBI.  The cops are at ease; bellies slop over
	belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat
	stains; shirtsleeves.  The marching men wouldn't sweat.

	QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving.  He
	gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals
	a few top officers to follow.  He looks resigned...

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)

	M.J., RUBEN, NIKKO, and a number of other officers are being
	addressed by SAKS, an FBI agent.  At the back are three more
	FBI AGENTS, suited and tied.  QUINN stands off to one side.
	THE SONG IS JUST ENDING, ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM.  A
	projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
	phone booth.

		Dr. Hudson:  Don't lose your head.
		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art.
		Well, if you have a taste for this experience
		You're flushed with your very first success
		Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
		Before your conscience bothers you much less.
		Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious
		In history's great dark hall of fame
		All of our greatest killers were industrious
		At least the ones that we all know by name."

	SAKS speaks...

				SAKS
		Hello.  I am (research title)
		Meryhew Saks.  The song is called
		"Murder By Numbers."  The
		performers are a group called The
		Police.  Adam here...
                ... from Behavioral Science is
		working out exactly what this
		perpetrator is trying to telegraph
		in the note.  This is an extremely
		complex case, and we have a lot of
		fancy theories floating around.
		We're not ruling out the possib-
		ility of three Copycat serial
		killers.  We have Quantico working
		on graphology, the Washington lap
		is cloning DNA from the secretor.
		It's our feeling that the best lead
		we have is the two sperm samples in
		one of the victims.  We have a team
		sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want
		to say a few word to you local
		people.  Your Commissioner asked
		for our assistance.  The Bureau
		does not send us in on these cases
		to lord it over the local police.
		We couldn't catch up on what you
		people know if we had a year.  We
		have nation-wide resources and hard
		state of the art forensic science;
		you have the local savvy.  Together
		we can be unbeatable.  Which one is
		Inspector Halloran?

				M.J.
		Over here.

	SAKS approaches M.J., guides her away from the others.
	TWO SHOT:  Saks is unctuous and insincere, self-confident.

				SAKS
		We don't see too many lady homicide
		detectives.  You have my respect.
		Have you discussed the note with
		Dr. Hudson?

				M.J.
		Someone broke into her place last
		night.  It wasn't connected to our
		case, but it shook her up pretty
		bad so I haven't...

	QUINN joins them, SAKS gives him a nod.

				SAKS
		I was just about to advise the
		Inspector here not to show Dr.
		Hudson the note.

				M.J.
		Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a
		pattern develop...

				SAKS
			(riding over her)
		We know Helen.  She's not exactly a
		credible collaborator.  Especially
		late in the day...

				M.J.
		She takes tranquilizers her doctor
		prescribes.

				SAKS
		Who prescribes the brandy?

	M.J.'S look makes SAKS smile.  QUINN is called to the phone.

				M.J.
		How come you're so up on Dr.
		Hudson?

				SAKS
		She is a writer, writing best
		selling books about serial killing.
		Giving lectures she's well-paid
		for.  Her interests are not the
		interests of law enforcement.

				M.J.
		Okay.

				SAKS
		We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's
		phone.  I know you won't mention
		it.

	So much for any trusting relationship, right?  QUINN has
	arrived, addresses SAKS.

				QUINN
		Sorry to interrupt.  I need a word
		with my officer...

	He turns to M.J.  Diplomatically, SAKS moves away.

				QUINN
		M.J., I'm going to have to borrow
		Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing
		in Chinatown is going down tomorrow
		night and Jack's kid got hit by a
		car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.

				M.J.
		What does this mean?  Now we got
		the FBI, my team is expendable?
		I'm working my ass off, is anybody
		listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He
		and Nikko don't even get on
		together...

				QUINN
		Teach both of them a lesson in
		cooperation and self-discipline.

				M.J.
		If this is a first step in kicking
		me off the case, just tell me, to
		my face, sir, don't waste time
		being diplomatic.

				QUINN
		Just, I need results.  And -- I am
		short-handed.  Who else am I gonna
		give him?

				M.J.
			(looking at Saks)
		Give him thatpompous son of a
		bitch.

	She turns and leaves, brushing past Saks as she goes... Gigi
	meets her...

				GIGI
		Lab called.  They got a result on
		the drug test you requested...?

	It takes a moment to remember what it was...

				GIGI
		They said it was Windex?

	If there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's
	gone now.  She starts after Quinn, sees he is in spirited
	dialogue with SAKS and decides to wait.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	HELEN and M.J.  Helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note, that
	M.J. has just given her.

				HELEN
		..."I'll be back..."

	As she looks at the back of the note... she looks up into
	M.J.'S face.

				M.J.
		Yeah.  Addressed to you.  "Don't
		lose your head."

	Helen puts down the note.  She is holding herself together
	by main will power... doesn't want to face that note...

				HELEN
		They put  Merry Saks on it?!

				M.J.
		He said to send you his regards and 
		to tell you that the Bureau holds
		you in the highest esteem.

				HELEN
		What I can't believe is that in an
		earlier life I slept with him!
		Christ!  Any God that loved his
		people would give women a rewind on
		their life and an erase button.
			(looks at M.J.)
		Just give me a minute here.  The
		letter is addressed to me...
			(she's breathing
			 fast, controls it)
		You don't feel fear, do you?
		You're young.  You feel like you'll
		live forever.  How wonderful.

				M.J.
		I put my ass on the line, giving
		you that.

				HELEN
		They weren't going to show it to
		me?!  The arrogance!  It's my life!

				M.J.
		It's also the major piece of
		evidence, and it makes you a key
		part of his plan.  You can't run
		away from it anymore.
			(beat)
		Look at the order he's doing
	them... He did three as the Boston
		Strangler just to tell us a copycat
		serial killer was at work.  Then he
		did one like the Hillside Strang-
		ler.  And then one as Son of Sam.
		To lead us on -- to where and what
		end?  And he's doing more than that
		-- he's imitating each killer's
		method as closely as he can -- in
		details.  Injecting Windex.  Using
		.44.  Playing Abba.

				HELEN
		It's not chronological: Son of Sam
		was before Hillside.

	She begins to read.

				M.J.
		It's clear he thinks he knows me.
		He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't
		lose your head.'  Is that a threat?
		Does he want to cut off my head?
		Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else?
		Kemper.  Did Gacy?  Rivkind?  I

	She puts the note down on the table, smoothes it out.  She
	closes her eyes for a moment.  We begin to see certain
	filtered images.  As they come, we INTERCUT them.

	EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

	Lush, pastoral green.  We see PETER sitting by himself.  He
	wears a WHITE LAB COAT, like one we saw hanging in his
	basement.

	HIS POV:  of students on the green, playing Frisbee,
	studying together, picnicking.  Women sunbathe, their straps
	pulled down on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to
	expose their midriffs.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		'First you make a stone of your
		heart.'... Oh yes!  He doesn't
		suffer.  That's past.  Now it's our
		turn.

	One of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round, then
	takes her top off entirely.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Kemper said in order to have the
		experience he wanted with them, he
		needed to evict them from their
		bodies.  By making the body a
		completely passive object, he
		releases himself from passivity.

	CLOSE:  HELEN, DEEP IN THOUGHT...

				HELEN
		But the relief he feels is only
		temporary.  '...Before your
		conscience bothers you much
		less...'  But the tension always
		comes back.
			(she now picks out
			 the words:)
		'You can join the ranks of the
		illustrious...'  He wants to be
		like them.  The best.  To become
		the best.  But, he has his own
		desires, his own compulsions apart
		from theirs.'  His own horrors...

	FLASHBACK: PETER'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

	An incremental flash of a SMALL BOY standing by his bed
	which he has wet.  His pajamas are soaked.  His powerful
	MOTHER grabs him by the hair and drags him with her.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Some horrors that are all his
		own...

	The SMALL BOY is flung into an under-stairs closet where
	firewood and stacked papers are kept.  The door is slammed
	hard.  He gropes around in the darkness, finds a big box of
	matches, lights one.  Then, angrily, he sets fire to a pile
	of newspapers.  They start to burn.  We see, but do not,
	hear, his screams for help.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		He needs to prove they don't
		control him, that he's the one in
		control.  But the feeling of power
		never lasts.  He can control his
		victims, but he can't control
		anything else... his place in the
		world.  He want s to be recognized.
		He puts messages in my computer; he
		sends me a letter...

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	She picks out the lines... "then you must try a twosome or a
	threesome."

				HELEN
		Of course he wants to do a
		threesome!  Only Bundy did three in
		one day.  Is Bundy next?  But Bundy
		should be last... the grand finale.
		What about Kemper and Ramirez?
		Gacy, Dahmer, Williams?  Rivkind?
		Who else is on his list?  In what
		order?

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	PETER in his car.  Ahead, he see TWO GIRLS at a bus stop.
	We see PETER take a long bladed-knife and carefully conceal
	it under his right thigh.  The TWO GIRLS are wearing
	backpacks.  'FESTIVAL OF LOVE' stickers decorate the bags.
	PETER pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says
	something.  They giggle, shake their heads.  He laughs,
	holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a 'Not
	guilty!' gesture, then makes a peace sign.  The girls giggle
	again, but do not get in.

	PETER drives off.

				DARYLL LEE
		Hey, Doc!  How you doing?

	She turns on speakerphone.

				HELEN
		Hello, Daryll Lee.

				DARYLL
		You read my book which as you know,
		hit the stands a couple of weeks
		ago.  You read it yet.

				HELEN
		What book?

				DARYLL
			(indignant)
		I sent it by private courier, he
		didn't give it to you?  That son of
		a gun...!

	Helen looks at M.J., who indicates 'tell you later.'

				HELEN
		I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.

				DARYLL
		Bet you never figured I'd follow in
		your footsteps.  It's real well-
		written.  You should read it --
		you're in it.

				HELEN
		I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and
		talk to you about it after I've
		read it.  Right now I have a
		question... Peter Kurten.

				DARYLL
		Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I
		told that son I'd send him what he
		wanted if he leave you alone.

				HELEN
		Ah ha.  What did he want?

				DARYLL
		Something personal.  Is he bothering
		you?

				HELEN
		I don't know.  I'd like to know
		where he is.

				DARYLL
		Listen, you want my advice?  Steer
		clear.  He's writing me he's gonna
		finish 'my unfinished symphony.'
		He's gonna give me $550 for some of
		my cum, he says he's in a position
		to see that I will be immortal if
		he has some of my spunk.  I'm
		offended.  Right away I smell
		freak.  Writin' about him and me
		and you bein' joined and he's gonna
		finish my symphony?  I didn't care
		for his drift.  I sent some liquid
		soap in a sandwich baggie with a
		message from Jesus to mend his
		ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And
		what's funny is, now I don't mind
		bein' inside.  If I was out, even
		Born Again, I'd probably get
		restless again.  It's maybe better
		I stay here, what do you think?

				HELEN
		I think whatever is best for you,
		Daryll.  And maybe you're right,
		that's the place.

				DARYLL
		You come and visit.

				HELEN
		Where did you send the message to
		Peter Kurten?

				DARYLL
		Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too!
		That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to
		Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in
		return for getting my book to you.

	At this mention of Conrad, M.J. leaps to another phone...

				HELEN
		How was Conrad supposed to find
		Kurten?

				DARYLL
		Conrad has the phone number.
		Conrad, where is he?

				HELEN
			(from M.J.'s pantomime)
		In jail.

				DARYLL
		That Klutz.  They send him back
		here, I'll kick his ass good.

				DARYLL LEE
		Helen, how is life, you okay?  Come
		see me, talk to me.  I think about
		you, worry about you all the time.
		I am so glad Jesus didn't let me
		kill you.  You know -- you're
		blessed by Jesus.  That's why you
		need to come talk to me, because
		Jesus kept you alive for a reason,
		and I was his sacred instrument...
		In the moment Satan was in my heart
		raising my hand to kill you, Jesus
		took my hand to spare you.  I am
		both death and life to you...

	Pandemonium: the Chinatown raid has been carried off and

	THROUGH IT, WE MOVE WITH M.J.  SHE PASSES RUBEN WHO IS
	GRABBING A CHINESE KID STRUNG OUT ON SOMETHING, OUT OF A
	LINE OF SUSPECTS... HE ASIDES:

				M.J.

	He manhandles the KID INTO DOCILITY WHILE...

				RUBEN
		The woman was in shock.  She was
		totally out on ranks.  I stayed
		because I didn't want her to wake
		up alone in a place where she'd
		just been under attack.
			(to the Kid who is
			 restless)
		Stop that, you son of a bitch!
			(back to her)
		The place wasn't secure.  I was
		doing my goddamn job!  And, for the
		second time, I slept in her living

				M.J.
		Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't
		have the face for it.  I need you
		to help interrogate the burglar in
		Hudson's place...

				RUBEN
		Talk to Nikko...!

	SHE MOVES ON TO FIND NIKKO

	NIKKO sites at his desk, processing the papers for the sullen
	YOUNG THUG who is handcuffed to a chain next to NIKKO'S
	desk.  Nikko  unholsters his gun... he shoves it into his
	desk drawer...

				NIKKO
		You speak English?
			(Chinese)
		You need an interpreter?

	QUINN, walking past the ILLEGALS, speaks to GIGI.

				QUINN
		I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted

				NIKKO
		Outta your mind?  Look at this...

				M.J.
			(to Quinn)
		Lieutenant...?

	Just at that moment the kid Ruben was booking goes totally
	bananas; M.J. goes to his assistance, wrestling this wild
	kid.

	NIKKO starts from his chair, looking for the key to the
	drawer, but is isn't there... he goes to help Ruben get the
	kid under control.  Quinn steps in...

				M.J.
		The prowler in Hudson's apartment
		turns out to have a meeting with a
		suspect...

				QUINN
			(amazed)
		You got a suspect...

	THEY MOVE BACK TO NIKKO'S DESK.

				QUINN
		How'd you get in on the deal?

				M.J.
		I'm gonna drop charges on the
		break-and-enter at Hudson's...

				QUINN
		You have no authority to make a
		deal like that.  That' s for the
		D.A...

				M.J.
		Or the F.B.I.?

				QUINN
		Saks.  If he knew you did that!
		They're all asking me, 'what is she
		doing,' as it is.

				M.J.
		Give me Ruben back...

				QUINN
		Nikko?

				NIKKO
		We get through this shit, let 'em
		all go.

	NIKKO has stood and moved the handcuffed THUG toward the
	door to jail cells.  M.J. checks her time, (WALL CLOCKS HELP
	US HERE:  8:47)

				M.J.
		I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll
		be in the jail when you wind this
		up...

				RUBEN
		I gotta get something to eat, I
		haven't eaten all day.

	M.J. goes... RUBEN can't find a desk to work at, and
	commandeers Nikko's.  He slams the KID into NIKKO'S chair
	and cuffs him.  KID starts to rattle his chairs, spew
	Chinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his
	teeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds.

	RUBEN yanks the papers out of the KID'S mouth, pulls the
	KID'S chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves
	the KID into place facing away from the desk, so that he
	can't do any more damage.  Then RUBEN can't figure out where
	he can work.  At the next desk, where he has been working,
	MAC rises.

				MAC
		Here... I'm finished...

				RUBEN
			(to Kid)
		I'm going to the coffee machine.
		Hold the fort.

	He moves off, the KID'S eyes move calculatingly around the
	room.  He twists against the cuffs, trying anything to get
	free, and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer.

	CLOSE UP:  The KID'S FREE HAND rifling through the drawer
	behind his back, finding the gun.  PULL BACK to show the
	KID.  He is as Ruben positioned him, his back pressed
	against the desk.

	scene.  A number of men wear 70's costume... an occasional
	bit of drag.

	ANDY and HAL dancing... ANDY with great abandon.  HAL seems
	to need a break.  He leads a good-naturedly protesting ANDY
	back to their table.  They find a stranger sitting there.

	IT IS PETER.

		He's on temp leave with pay.  I

	M.J. pulls her badge out and puts it down in front of Quinn.

				M.J.
		You want mine, too?  You take his,
		you take mine.  I'm the one fucked
		it up...

				QUINN
		So I'm maybe gonna lose three good
		cops?  You fucked up on this
		occasion, but don't be so hard on
		yourself.  There's something I want
		you to think about.  The book says
		if you use your gun, use it to
		kill, that's what it's meant to do.
		You tried to pick this punk off
		with fancy shooting, to keep him
		alive.  To what end?  You're not
		willing to kill, you can't be a

		You were right!  He knew me!  He
		went to my lectures.  He recorded

	She is too full of her own shock to wonder why M.J. is here
	at this hour and to notice the state M.J. is in... she has
	turned back to the answering machine and hits the play

	Helen has turned and now sees M.J.'s condition.  SHE STOPS
	THE TAPE...

				HELEN
		What happened to you?!

				M.J.
		Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop
		thing, a crazy kid and a buncha
		dumb mistakes... I'm sorry...
		because you and he...

	Tears start again, just running down, no sobs, but she can't
	will them away.  She brushes at them angrily...

				M.J.
		I just thought it was so --
		unprofessional.  Of you both!

				HELEN
		He felt sorry for me.  It was so
		nice to flirt.  He was a darling
		man.

				M.J.
		A man?  I thought he was a boy.
			(bursting out)
		This last Christmas was the
		happiest Christmas I had in the
		last ten years... you know why?  It
		was the first Christmas in six
		years I was not in love.  Son of a

		and noisy?!

				HELEN
		You're exhausted.  Let me get you a
		brandy.

				M.J.
		Where's the john?  Let me clean up
		this mess, and get back to work.

	Helen has stepped to her brandy decanter; M.J., too dejected
	to move, sits, staring now at the only thing to stare at: the
	computer screen.

				HELEN (O.S.)
		Who's the married man?

				M.J.
		What does it matter?  This guy, you
		checked your course records, who
		signed up?

	Helen returns with the brandy.  M.J. holds it, doesn't drink,
	just stares at the computer screen, emotionally dead...

				HELEN
		The University computer is down for
		maintenance, but I've been going
		through my own notes...

				M.J.
			(her voice is dead)
		Look.  There's the order:  you
		wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi &
		Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's
		going to be Dahmer next.  Which
		means he'll kill a man.

	With an effort of will M.J. moves to the phone, putting the
	brandy down.

				HELEN
		Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...

				M.J.
			(dialing)
		Bundy.  That's the last one in your
		speech...

				HELEN
		Maybe you should...

				M.J.
		I'm working on it!  It's what I do.

		Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.

	to SEE.

	PETER AND THE COED are just moving off, the Coed holding his
	books, he hobbling on the crutches.  M.J. runs through the
	crowd toward him, and those who notice are pissed... she is
	getting close when, just as he and the coed would pass from
	sight behind a wall, PETER looks around, straight at M.J..

	IT ISN'T PETER AT ALL.

	M.J. LOOKING AROUND, MOVES TO STAIRS TO SECOND FLOOR...

	M.J. EMERGING FROM STAIRS INTO THE CORRIDOR -- SHE RUNS DOWN
	THIS CORRIDOR OF ROOMS, PUSHING OPEN ANY THAT ARE SHUT.

	A SCARED COUPLE MAKING LOVE CONFRONT HER GUN.  SHE
	REHOLSTERS IT AND RACES DOWN THE HALLWAY...

	OVER THE PARTY NOISE AND MUSIC WE HEAR A SCREAM.  M.J. RACES
	DOWN CORRIDORS, TRYING TO FIND THE SOURCE.  ANOTHER SCREAM.
	IT SEEMS TO COME FROM BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR.  M.J. KICKS IT
	OPEN, BURSTING IN:

	INT. ROOM

	A BUNCH OF STONED STUDENTS PASSING A JOINT: ON A TV PLAYER
	IS THE IMAGE OF JAMIE LEE CURTIS IN AN EARLY SHOCKER: THEY
	ARE PLAYING AT WHO CAN OUT-SCREAM JAMIE LEE CURTIS.

	WHEN JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAMS --

	THEY ALL SCREAM BACK!  AND BURST INTO HOWLS OF LAUGHTER.  THE
	SIGHT OF M.J. WITH HER GUN OUT ONLY MAKES THEM HOWL LOUDER.

				STUDENT
		Swallow the joint!  It's Barney
		Phyfe -- in drag!

	THEN ALTOGETHER THEY SCREAM AT HER!  AND HOWL WITH LAUGHTER.

	THE HALL. 

	M.J. walks out of the room and down the corridor.

	EXT. CHI OMEGA FRONT STEPS

	SHE LOOKS OUT ACROSS THE PARKING LOT: THE GOLD VW BUG IS 
	GONE.

	SHE WALKS TO HER CAR, RELIEVED.  THE WHOLE THING SEEMS LIKE
	A NIGHTMARE FROM WHICH SHE HAS NOW AWAKENED.

	INT. M.J'S CAR

	AS SHE OPENS THE DOOR, REACHES IN AND GRABS HER PHONE.  SHE
	ACTIVATES PHONE, WHEN SHE IS BLINDSIDED BY PETER WHO SLAMS
	HER INTO THE CAR, FACE DOWN ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT.  HE 
	DISARMS HER, TWISTS HER INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT...

	THERE ARE STUDENTS AT SOME DISTANCE, BUT SHE CAN'T MAKE
	HERSELF BE HEARD.  SHE IS GROGGY FROM THE BLOW SHE'S TAKEN.
	HE HANDCUFFS HER TO THE CAR, FIND HER KEYS, AND BEGINS TO
	DRIVE AWAY... PETER'S HAIR IS NOW BRIGHT RED -- LIKE DARYLL
	LEE CULLUM'S.

								CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Helen lies wide awake in the dark.  PHONE RINGS.

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

	INSERT: TAPE RECORDER ATTACHED TO PHONE.  IT STARTS TO TURN.
	AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM AN FBI DETECTIVE IS POURING HIMSELF
	SOME COFFEE.  HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WE HEAR:

				HELEN (V.O.)
			(thinking it's M.J.)
		Where are you?

				PETER (V.O.)
		Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter
		Foley -- how do you grade me now,
		Doctor?

	HELEN ON PHONE

				HELEN
			(beat)
		Who was the man in the basement?

				PETER
		You like that action?  Didn't that
		cop on TV look solemn?  The guy in
		the basement doesn't matter,
		anyway, just another lonely heart.

				HELEN
		Where are you, Peter?

				PETER
		You thought I was going to do Ted
		Bundy next, so you sent your
		partner...

	Helen gasps with the implications of that...

				PETER
		What was that?  What am I hearing?
		The sound of an epiphany, a sudden
		blinding insight?

				HELEN
		It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?

				PETER
		Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You
		have to come to me.

				HELEN
		You know I can't do that.

				PETER
		Oh, I think you will.

	Peter rips duct tape off M.J.'s mouth...

				M.J.
			(yelling)
		Call the police!  Now!  Call Qui...

	Peter punches M.J. who is handculled in her car; they are
	parked in front of the Lecture Hall.

				HELEN
		For God's sake Peter, leave her out
		of it.  You don't want her, you
		want me.

				PETER
		I need her; she's a cop.  I have to
		kill a cop, and then...

				HELEN
		You've been perfect.  Don't spoil
		the symmetry -- you have to have a
		male cop.

				PETER
		I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's
		the important thing.  Cop-ness, not
		sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but
		it'll be good.

				M.J.
			(yells)
		Call Quinn and Saks.

				PETER
		I'm tired.  I want it to end
		tonight, don't you?

				HELEN
		Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now.
		Let her go.  I'll come -- just let
		her go.  She's not important.

				PETER
		You know where.

				HELEN
		Where it began -- McCluskey
		Auditorium.

	He hangs up.

	INSERT: TAPE MONITOR.  WE HEAR HELEN HANGING UP.  A SMALL
	COMPUTER CHIP VOICE IS HEARD.  THE FBI MAN IS MEASURING
	SUGAR INTO HIS COFFEE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM.  HE CAN'T
	HEAR:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Time Zero-hundred and twenty -- two
		minutes and sixteen seconds June

	BATHROOM DRAWER

	It is pulled open: metallic sounds of  bullets rolling on the
	wooden drawer: her hand bats away the usual bathroom drawer
	garbage and pull Ruben's gun out; HER TREMBLING FINGERS
	RELOAD IT.

	EXT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALL - NIGHT

	Helen wearing loose coat, jeans and sneakers opens the door.
	FRED snaps out of a sound sleep.

				HELEN
		It's all over, Fred.  They got the
		guy.  You go home to your own bed
		now.

				FRED
		I got to have that from my
		superior.  One guy fired off this
		job already.

				HELEN
		Call in.  Use my phone.  They'll
		tell you -- it's all over.

	FRED GOES.  HELEN STEPS RESOLUTELY INTO THE HALL, FOR
	REASSURANCE BRACES HERSELF WITH A HAND ON THE WALL.

	THE HALLWAY (HER POV).  IT SEEMS MILES LONG.  SOUND: HER
	FRONT DOOR CLICKING SHUT -- THE SAME ESSENTIAL EVENT AS SO
	LONG AGO WHEN RUBEN HAD TO SHOOT OFF THE DOOR LOCK...

	HELEN LOOKS BACK AT THE DOOR.  BRIDGES BURNED.  TURNS BACK.

	HER HAND ON WALL: AS SHE MOVES A TENTATIVE STEP HER HAND
	PRESSES HEAVILY, SLIDING ALONG THE WALL.  THEN HER HAND
	MOVES A LITTLE FASTER, AND FASTER.

	HER POV.  THE HALL SEEMS MORE NORMAL.  MOVING SHOT PICKS UP
	SPEED...

	HER HAND NOW BRUSHES THE WALL WITH ONLY FINGERTIPS.

	HELEN MOVES WITH MORE AND MORE CONFIDENCE: HER AGORAPHOBIA
	IS GONE... HER HAND DROPS TO HER SIDE...

	EXT. HER BUILDING - NIGHT

	The door opens and Helen appears in it.  She confronts the
	street and the night... One more threshold to cross...

	STREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED.  THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND
	IT'S COVERED WITH CITY GRIME.  The night seems to roar; the
	lights blur and flare.  A truck comes past too fast, 
	stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind.

	HELEN steeling herself and running the few steps to her car.

	INT. CAR as she slides into the driver's seat, slamming the
	door and locking it.  She drives off into the night.

	EXT. MULUSKEY AUDITORIUM -  NIGHT

	A broad view through shadowy trees shows it's lighted
	facade.  Parked in front of is M.J.'s car.  SUDDENLY FROM
	BEHIND THE TREES, SAKS STEPS OUT IN FRONT, BLOCKING THE WAY!

	REVERSE:  HELEN'S CAR IS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS US.
	SAKS (AND NOW WE SEE OTHER SWAT TYPES IN THE SHADOWS, HIDDEN
	FROM THE VIEW OF THE AUDITORIUM) STANDS IN THE STREET
	FLAGGING HER DOWN --

	SHE STOPS, PUTTING DOWN WINDOW.  SAKS RESTS HIS HAND ON THE
	DOOR... He shoves no sign of recognizing her...

				SAKS
		Ma'am, please get out of your
		vehicle...

				HELEN
		Merry, how... oh, Christ, of
		course, you had my phone tapped.

				SAKS
		Just get out of your vehicle...

				HELEN
		He's got Sergeant Halloran in
		there.  He'll kill her the minute
		he sees or hears your people...

				SAKS
		You've been very useful, Doctor, we
		appreciate all you've done, and now
		the professional will take over...

				HELEN
		He wants me, he doesn't care about
		her.  Let me...

	SAKS HAS THE DOOR OPEN AND IS REACHING TO PULL HER FROM THE
	DRIVER'S SEAT... HELEN SUCKS IN HER BREATH AND JAMS ON THE
	GAS.  SAKS IS ALMOST DRAGGED AWAY WITH HER, SPUN AROUND AND
	FALLING ON THE PAVEMENT.  SHE SLAMS THE DOOR AS SHE SPEEDS
	TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...

	SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN
	AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING
	HIM FROM SHOOTING.

	NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
	street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
	brakes behind M.J.'s car.

	CLOSE: HELEN.  Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.
	She gets out of the car.  As she walks even her sneakers
	make an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up
	the wide stairs...

	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The huge doors creak open and Helen enters.  She stands,
	listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall
	windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough
	without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily
	returns...

	Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.
	She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
	building cooling in the night air.  Or is the movement of
	Peter somewhere in the room?

	She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
	auditorium...

	CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE.  NOTHING.

	THEN:

	PETER IS STARING BACK.  HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE.  THE
	VISION SNAPS.

	HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO
	A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK
	CORRIDOR.  SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY.
	THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT.  AS SHE
	WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE
	SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE
	DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP.  SHE
	SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.

	REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM.  THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM
	BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN.  IN REVERSE, WE SEE
	FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM
	HER NECK.  WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP,
	BUT SHE IS PARALYZED, FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
	TERRIBLE SLOW MOTION INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING
	AT HER, HELEN'S HELPLESS HORROR, THE COP'S APPEALING LOOK TO
	HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE
	COP'S THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR.

	HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM!

	CLOSE: HELEN (PRESENT) RECOVERING.  (SHE HASN'T SCREAMED AT
	ALL.)  SHE PULLS RUBEN'S GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN
	THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.

	AS THE DOOR OPENS.  THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT,
	BLINDING IN HERE.  SHE STEPS IN.  THERE IS A SOUND THAT
	DRAWS HER ROUND, HER GUN COMING UP: BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE
	BROOM CLOSET... SHE FIRES TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CLOSET DOOR.
	IT SPRINGS OPEN AND MOPS AND PAILS FALL THUNDEROUSLY OUT
	ONTO THE TILE FLOOR.

	SHE WHIRLS TO COVER HER BACK; FACES THE STALLS.

	EXT. SAKS' ROADBLOCK - NIGHT

	THEY REACT TO ECHOES OF THE GUNFIRE.

				SWAT
		Oh, man?!  Let us in there.

				SAKS
		Go.  Go.  Go!

	Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows
	toward the Auditorium...

	INT. LADIES' ROOM

	HELEN MOVES ALONG THE STALLS PUSHING DOORS OPEN.  UNTIL SHE
	SHOVES ONE OPEN AND SEES:

	M.J. IS HANGING BY A NOOSE, DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID
	IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE.  SHE IS ALIVE, HOLDING THE NOOSE
	FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...

	HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO
	OUT.  PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER,
	REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.

				PETER
		You cheated!  You said you'd come
		die with me.

	WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE
	HANGS.  HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER
	HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR
	OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN,
	WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.

	EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	WITH EFFICIENCY AND CAUTION FBI SWAT TYPES MOVE TOWARD THE
	AUDITORIUM.  A GRAPPLING HOOK IS THROWN HIGH OVER THE ROOF;
	THEY PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT.  A HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN, BATHING
	THE SCENE IN ITS BRILLIANT LIGHT...

	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

	PETER HAS HELEN ON THE STAGE WHERE CHAIRS ARE RANDOMLY
	SCATTERED AND PUSHED HER TO A SEAT FACING HIM, ALMOST KNEE
	TO KNEE... HELEN WILL USE HER PSYCHOLOGICAL WILES TO TRY TO
	TAKE AWAY PETER'S CONTROL OF THE SITUATION... PETER LOOKS UP
	AT THE SOUND... HE IS PROUD AND THRILLED.

				PETER
		Listen to them!  We'll be on all
		three channels.

				HELEN
		Kill me, Peter, do it, now.

				PETER
		No.  Not yet.

				HELEN
		Do it.  If that's what all this
		carnage is about, then do it.  Have
		enough guts to do it.

				PETER
		Don't talk to me about courage.  I
		know death, what it's like to kill.
		You're not a killer -- you watched
		Daryll Lee kill that cop and you
		didn't make a peep, because you
		were paralyzed with fear.  You
		chocked.  I know something else about
		you.

	Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a
	pill into his mouth and swallows...

				PETER
		You want one?  No?  There was
		something in you that was
		fascinated, that wanted to see what
	it was like for a man to die.
		Everybody feels it.  Like every
		person who slows to see a bad
		accident, or runs to see a fire.
		That's true.  I see it in you...
		you're the same as me.

	THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE... LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN.

				PETER
		Oh, no.

	HE GRABS HER, AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM, WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AS
	HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE.

	FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE,
	INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND
	DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER.  GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.

	He leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair
	facing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

				PETER
		We'll keep talking.  Until they get
		here.  Then...
			(smiles)

				HELEN
		I have no life anymore.  I ruined
		your life, make me pay for it.

				PETER
		Why did you do that?  Didn't you
		have any idea how hard it was for
		me, to get that far?  I worshipped
		you.  You inspired me.  I thought
		you could understand me the way you
		understood the others.  I knew that
		about you -- the ones you admired
		were the great murderers; they
		fascinated you.

				HELEN
		That's not who I admire -- I admire
		people who are good at what they
		do, great artists, writers,
		thinkers...

				PETER
		I don't have the talent for any of
		those things.  All I have a talent
		for is death.  And I am one of a
		kind.  What do you think of your
		student now?  I have made you
		famous, I am your creation and your
		monument.

	BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A
	VANTAGE POINT: WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE FIGURE... HELEN SEES
	BUT PETER DOES NOT.

				HELEN
		If you let me, I can make you more
		famous than any of them.

				PETER
		Oh, please.  I know what's coming,
		now.  "Let me help you..."

				HELEN
		Do anything you want to me.  I give
		myself to you.  Only put the knife
		down.  Isn't this what you always
		wanted?  I know it's what we all
		want, to love and to loved.  I
		could love you.  You could work
		together in some safe place, learn
		to really understand you, help you,
		give you some peace of mind, some
		happiness...

				PETER
		Back in the driver's seat again,
		Doctor?  That old dream -- study us
		to see what makes us sick.  So you
		can find a cure -- they'd name it
		after you?  Death is the only cure
		for people like me.

	He leans toward her with the knife.  This might be the
	moment.  His gun lies on the floor beside him.

	HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT
	AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS,
	TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS.  HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING
	THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.

	HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM
	BACKWARD.  SHE STANDS... HE COMES UP WITH GUN... AND AIMS AT
	HER...

	BEHIND HIM M.J. STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS HAVING NOW A CLEAN
	SHOT.

	HELEN DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE, JUST LOOKS INTO PETER'S EYES AS
	M.J. AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER
	SHOT: SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER.

				HELEN
		Do it.  For God's sake, now...

	M.J. FIRES.

	PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT, STANDS THERE,
	SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT... HE STARES AT HER.

				PETER
			(surprised, like a
			 child)
		You hurt me!

	M.J. HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM, READY TO SHOOT AGAIN, BUT HE JUST
	GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING... AS:

	THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS
	EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.

	THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED
	SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION
	GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND
	SHADOWS.

	OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...

				M.J. & HELEN
		No!!

	PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN
	SCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...

	A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT
	TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.

	SWAT TEAM

	LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.

	PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND
	SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

	M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE
	BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.

				M.J.
		Jesus that hurts.  You think the
		rib is busted?

				PARAMEDIC
		That looks like just a bad bruise.
		I'll tape it up if you want to...

				M.J.
		I'll take some Tylenol and codeine,
		instead, how about a lot of number
		six?

	The medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around
	them.  Helen sits down next to M.J.  M.J. begins to put on
	her shirt, wincing at the movement.  Helen helps her.

				M.J.
			(it hurts)
		Oh, God.

	SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND
	LIGHT AND SHADOW.  When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun
	and hands it to him.  It is what he expects, but she
	misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her
	resignation from the cops.  He takes it only as a part of
	officer related shooting routine.  SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE
	AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.

				QUINN
		I'll take it, kid.  You take two
		weeks paid leave.  Don't waste a
		second thinking about that shitbag.
		Then come back.  You're a cop, M.J.

	He nods to Helen...

				QUINN (cont'd)
		Get the civilians outta here.

				M.J.
		She's in no shape to give her
		statement tonight...

				QUINN
		No, she can come in tomorrow...
		gonna want to know a lot of
		things...

	B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING
	HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage
	and lifted him onto a gurney.  The body is wheeled past
	them, as...

				HELEN
		The only one who could tell you
		what you really need to know is
		dead.

				QUINN
		Yeah, it's a thought...

	Of no importance to him, he turns away...

	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big
	exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion
	grenades).  Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus
	under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault.  M.J. and
	HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...

	THE AUDITORIUM (POV).

	The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a
	small door -- easy escape.  They run toward it...

	EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	It is dark where they step out into the night.  Around the
	corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA
	CIRCUS.  THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.
	M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.
	SHE CATCHES UP TO HER.  HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK
	AWAY...

				M.J.
		You could use a long hot bath, you
		know that?  You better get somebody
		to drive you home.

				HELEN
		Why can't I drive home?  I will.
		You.  Look at you.  You need a ride
		home.  And you don't even know it.

				M.J.
			(beat)
		Well, thanks.

	The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside
	the circle of media.  CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL
	SHOT.

	THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.

				SUSAN
		Hey!  Halloran!  What's the story
		here?

	On the two women getting in the car...

				HELEN
		If she has to ask, she's never
		gonna know.

	HIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE
	NIGHT.

				THE END
INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY

	The hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is
	speaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is
	a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
	FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
	TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
	pointing device.  We see her from a considerable
	distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and
	assured.

				HELEN
		Our society creates these socially
		and psychically disenfranchised
		men, and their revenge on society
		is terrible.  They are hard to
		catch.  They are "the nice guy next
		door," their employers -- if they
		work at all -- find them quiet and
		uncomplaining.  Early abuse and
		rejection have taught them
		passivity.  Only in their violent
		fantasies do they feel alive.  What
		they seek in their frenzied
		assaults on their victims is relief
		from passivity.  For these men, ten
		minutes relief is worth far more
		than the life of another human
		being.  Torture, the pain they
		inflict, the screams of the victim,
		are all part of the ritual that
		gives them a brief respite from
		their own psychic pain.  And then
		the depression, the forgetting, the
		feeling of sadness and despair
		begins the cycle all over again.
		Like addicts seeking their drug,
		Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
		Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
		seek out their next victim.

	During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera
	has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
	balcony railing.

	CLOSEUP: HELEN

				HELEN
		The cycle is endless until they are
		caught.  And they are caught by
		chance -- they run a red light, and
		a body is in the trunk.  A leaking	
		pipe brings a plumber to a basement
		where they is the smell of death.

	Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
	the balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.

	HELEN'S POV:

	Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
	MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
	arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.

	HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:

	Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly
	alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
	exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the
	wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
	attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...

	Their POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
	there.

	HELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:

				HELEN
		At any time, right now, as you
		listen, the FBI estimates there are
		30 to 35 serial killers stalking
		their victims.  The serial killer is
		a plaque that must be addressed not
		only by the law, but by science.
		Florida spent eight million dollars
		to execute Ted Bundy.  It would
		have been better spent building a
		forensic penal facility devoted to
		research.

	Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
	that the smiling man is not there...

				HELEN
		Confined for life, without parole,
		and subjected to scientific study,
		these men's lives might finally, in
		some small measure, educate and
		thereby protect society.  Thank
		you.

	Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are
	carefully casing the crowd.

	The crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
	ladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes 
	as well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
	THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
	DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...

								CUT TO:

	INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY

	THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks
	around.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He
	hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.
	Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to
	stand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the
	high heels to a stall several doors down.

	CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:

	And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
	ankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from
	view as

	HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper
	around the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise
	makes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is
	just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES
	DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.

	Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently
	yanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.

	CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears
	the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He
	reacts...

	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED

	The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
	hook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)

				COP (o.s.)
		Doctor Hudson?  Are you okay in
		there?

	The MAN lets slip a little slack.

	HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,
	get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
	scream.

	CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous
	sounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for
	a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now
	there is more SOUND from inside...

	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	COP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder
	we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at
	her throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
	toilet seat.

	COP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we
	see a broom closet door opening.

	HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a
	second, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,
	his gun still in his hand.

	RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at
	HELEN.

	COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions
	in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,
	the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

	STAGE AREA

	The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.
	HELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.

								SLAM CUT:

	INT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

	As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try
	desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now
	pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her
	eyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

				HELEN
		Andy!  Andy!

	She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
	FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
	hall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...

	INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

	The room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it
	is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)

	HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO
	HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,
	where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)
	The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm
	herself with the sound of her own voice...

				HELEN
		It is October twelfth, 1994 in the
		city of San Francisco, California,
		U.S.A., the strongest, richest,
		most stable and happiest country in
		the world.  That is the sole place
		of life in the universe.  Under
		God.

	CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,
	others scattering from the nervous haste...

	CLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
	tosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard
	reflection with a certain detachment...

				HELEN
		Good God.  What happened to you?

	She barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will
	herself from near-hysteria to relative calm...

								CUT TO:

	HALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.
	She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.
	Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The
	other shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the
	screen comes a command.

				CHESSMASTER
		'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam
		move.'

	She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a
	move.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
	computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.

				CHESSMASTER
		'Lousy move.  Not really into this
		game, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've
		got a feeling about you.  Let's
		meet.  Like a date.'

	HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.

				HELEN
		'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your
		life.'

				CHESSMASTER
		'Another romantic dream gone all to
		hell.'

				HELEN
		'Maybe it's better to just dream
		on; avoid the disappointments of
		life.  Come on, move.'

	She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window
	curtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the
	T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us."  She crosses to
	the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.

	VIEW:

	A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The
	morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.
	HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the
	air, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream
	horror of the night...

	O.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.

	CLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
	handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.

				HELEN
			(carefully)
		Yes?
			(listens)
		You son-of-a-bitch!  Son of
		a bitch...

	Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.

				HELEN
		You filthy... son of a bitch!

	On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
	move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:

				COMPUTER
			(filter)
		You Queen is in check.
		Protect your Queen.

	OVER CREDITS:

	HOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is
	morning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in
	a long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly
	near the end of a satisfactory run.

	THE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY
	SLOW MOTION.  WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
	AT WORK HERE.

	NOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S
	OPEN-MOUTHED DEEP BREATHING LOOK LIKE

	A SCREAM!

	END TITLE AND CREDITS:

	INT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY

	MUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST
	DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...

	THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;
	centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the
	shoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES
	FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none
	in the circle.

				M.J. (V.O.)
		My third grade teacher at the
		convent shot better than that.

	THE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.

				RUBEN
		Yeah, but she had divine guidance.

	We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.
	HALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking
	young woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.
	appears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,
	thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
	sergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
	sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
	even smaller and younger than she is.

	RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior
	in authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored
	and laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his
	belt.

	M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,
	AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.

				M.J.
		I'd feel a whole lot safer with
		Sister Loretta for my backup.  Look
		at this guy: you shredded him!

				RUBEN
		Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me
		now.

	The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back 
	to shooting position.

				M.J.
		It's sloppy shooting.  It's in
		character, Ruben, but unnecessary.
		And bad for your career.

	RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the
	circle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.

				RUBEN
		I've been practicing.  Now can I
		kiss your tummy?

	M.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.

				M.J.
		Perp's holding a hostage, the
		shoulder on his gun hand is gonna
		be exposed.

	SOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her
	fire.

				M.J.
		Answer it.

				RUBEN
		I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't
		you at least interested in which
		one it is?

	She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he
	answers, she raises her gun and aims...

				RUBEN
			(into phone)
		I'm here, where are you?...
		Heeeeyyy!  What a surprise!  No.  On
		duty, have to call you back... You,
		too, you too.  My God, you made my
		day.

	He hits the "end" button...

				M.J.
		You hit the brachial nerve...

	SHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,
	inside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY
	IN THE MIDDLE!

				M.J.
		You're good enough you'll never
		have to kill anyone.  I joined the
		cops to save lives, not waste them.

				RUBEN
		You know, M.J., when I watch you
		shoot, I realize I've got a little
		problem with my stance... could you
		just move over here and critique my
		legs?

	He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.
	She is unloading her weapon...

				M.J.
		The problem is between your legs.
		You told your shrink about that?

	She is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...

				RUBEN
		I tell my shrink about you,
		Sergeant.  I tell him you're the
		top cop of my dreams.

	Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which
	he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks
	one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...

				M.J.
			(putting away her
			 gear)
		Don't take that mess in the car.

	They're on the move; as they go away from us...

				RUBEN
		He's in love with you already...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

	They pull up in front of an apartment building in the
	Pacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the
	thick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"
	is already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.
	A couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN
	SCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay
	M.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...

				M.J.
		Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already
		here.

	She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak
	of a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.

				RUBEN
		Hey.  And there's the Haircut right
		behind.  If she stops short he's
		gonna be there feet up her ass...

				SUSAN
			(on camera)
		Inspector, can you...

				M.J.
		I just got here myself, Susan.

				SUSAN
		...confirm this third murder adds
		up to a pattern?  Do we have a
		serial killer on the loose in the
		city?

				M.J.
		I just got here.  Talk to you
		later...

				M.J.
			(as they escape behind the
			 barrier tape)
		What the hell does she want to do,
		scare everybody to death?

				RUBEN
		That's her job... Jesus, Quinn is
		here already.

	QUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide
	stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.
	As they climb up toward him...

				QUINN
		I been waiting... I have to do
		everything myself.  Photo, crime
		tech, the Coroner are already
		inside.  The Landlady calls it in;
		tenant is not answering when
		called, she sticks her head in,
		sees the body, uses the deceased's
		telephone to call 911.  Otherwise
		nothing disturbed.  It's all yours,
		kid.  I'll take care of the Mouth
		and the Haircut.

	M.J. and Ruben enter...

	INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY

	Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;
	at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman
	chain-smoking (the Landlady).

				M.J.
			(to cop)
		That the Landlady?
			(to Ruben)
		You wanna talk to her, Ruben?
			(back to cops)
		Who was first on the scene?

	Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben!

				MIKE
		I was.

				M.J.
			(forcefully)
		I'm over here?  What's your name,
		Officer?

				MIKE
		Michael Johnson.

				M.J.
		You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up
		anything?  Use the doorknob?  I
		don't want to find your prints on
		anything later and you tell me you
		forgot to tell me.

				MIKE
		No.  I didn't.

	She glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I
	DIDN'T."  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	The same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair
	still in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and
	pushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one
	leg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is
	slightly posed, but casual, relaxed.

	Bending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE
	MEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.

	M.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.
	Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is
	finishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's
	men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between
	them; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the
	body.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO
	THE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.  
	
	ON M.J.:
	
				DOC (V.O.)
		Liver and rigor are telling me
		about eight hours.  I'm gonna take
		her out now if it's alright.

				M.J.
		I'm seeing ligature marks on her
		neck here, petechial hemorrhages in
		her eyes.  Strangled.

				DOC
		You got it.  Same as the other two.

	THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

				COP (V.O.)
		Tell whoever she can't come to the
		phone, she's all tied up.

	Nobody laughs...

				M.J.
		That's real old material, get a new
		writer...

	She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding
	it in tissue someone hands her...

				M.J.
		Hello?

				PHONE VOICE
			(extremely cheerful)
		Hello!  This is Geena Martinez, how
		are you this morning?

				M.J.
		What is this about, Ms Martinez?

				PHONE VOICE
		I'm conducting a telephone survey
		to determine whether you're
		satisfied with your insurance on
		your personal valuables...

	M.J. gently hangs up the phone.  She has been looking at the
	Dead Woman... They pick up where they left off.

				DOC
		He used something soft, like a
		stocking or a bathrobe tie.

				M.J.
		Anybody find it?

	No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin
	lifting the body out of the tub.  M.J. takes one last look
	into the dead woman's eyes...

				M.J.
		Cover her up, please.

	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes.  M.J.
	approaches Mike... takes him aside...

				M.J.
		Mike.  Why don't you tell me what's
		bothering you?

	Mike is acutely uncomfortable.

				M.J.
		Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out
		and sooner is a hell of lot better
		than later.

				MIKE
		Well, there's something missing in
		there.  There was something around
		her neck when I came in there, but
		it's gone now.

				M.J.
		Who came in after you?

				MIKE
		Lieutenant  Quinn.

	She seems relieved.  Brightly:

				M.J.
		Well, it's all right, then, Mike.
		Thanks.

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

	In the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the
	scene; Ruben appears behind her.  The photographer is coming
	out...

				M.J.
			(to Photographer)
		Get me good faces on the crowd
		here.  Get a couple of harness bulls
		to grab anybody who starts to
		run...

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Don't tell your Grandmother how to
		suck eggs.  I only been doing this
		work since your junior prom,
		darling...

	But M.J. is already on to other things.

	INT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

	CLOSE ON A FOLDED NEWSPAPER THAT LIES ON THE FLOOR FIVE OR
	FIX FEET FROM THE DOOR TO HELEN'S APARTMENT.  HOLD DOOR IN
	B.G.

	The door opens and Helen looks out, wasted from cognac and
	Xanax.  She looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look
	of despair.

	HELEN'S POV

	The newspaper lies there, out of reach.

	HELEN

	As she stretches out her foot toward the paper, can't reach
	it.

	POV.  As she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia
	manifests itself: DISTORTED VISION THAT MAKES THE HALL
	STRETCH AND THE WALLS TAKE ON EXAGGERATED PERSPECTIVE;
	SICKENING -- VERTIGO!  The newspaper seems further away.

	HELEN  She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further
	into the hall...

	POV.  The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her.
	The newspaper melts like a Dali watch.

	HELEN sweats.  She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward
	the newspaper... and with a supreme effort grabs it and
	squirms back inside.

	INT. APARTMENT - DAY

	As she slams the door shut on the hall, and sits gasping for
	breath.  After a moment she can bring herself to look at the
	newspaper... INSERT:

	POLICE BAFFLED IN DEATHS OF THE WOMEN

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Damn fools!

							CUT TO:

	INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

	QUINN is watching a portable TV screen with profound distrust.
	Onscreen is SUSAN SCHIFFER.

				SUSAN
		... continues to stonewall the
		public.  Now...

	There is a knock, but before QUINN can respond, M.J. enters.

				M.J.
		You messed with the scene.

				QUINN
		Shut up.

	He and M.J. both listen to SUSAN.

				SUSAN
		... third Bay Area woman has been
		strangled, but the police continue
		to deny that this is the work of
		one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn
		declares that the murders will be
		treated as unrelated crimes, unless
		new evidence...

	M.J. TURNS OFF THE TV, FACES QUINN...

				M.J.
		You messed with the evidence.

				QUINN
		I tagged the goddamned stocking.
		It ain't lost.  We're sequestering
		that evidence.  That's the trap some
		son of a bitch is going to fall
		into...

				M.J.
		Am I in charge of this thing?  Or
		not.

				QUINN
		I said you were...

				NH
		Then I decided what evidence we
		choose to sequester.

				QUINN
			(a beat here)
		Okay.  What do you want to
		sequester?

				M.J.
		The stocking around the neck.

	A long moment of looking at each other.  Then...

				QUINN
		You didn't say serial killer and I
		didn't say serial killer.

				M.J.
		Right.

				QUINN
			(not satisfied she
			 really means it)
		This is the anniversary of the
		summer of love and your city
		fathers have declared a Festival of
		Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of
		Commerce don't want TV announcing
		killers on the loose.

				M.J.
		Right.

	And she starts to go...

				QUINN
		We're gonna have a bunch of clapped
		out old hippies blissing on the
		Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the
		park, smoking dope and sticking
		tulips up their ass.

				M.J.
			(exiting)
		Good.

	INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

	This large room is very busy, many officers at work.  Known
	sexual offenders have been rounded up.  False confessors add
	to the crowd.  Detectives who are not dealing with these
	people are making and taking calls.  At this desk, a tall
	intense looking Detective, NICCOLETTI, interrogates a false
	confessor, a man who looks like a businessman...

				NIKKO
		Harvey, I don't want you in here no
		more, making false statements...

				CONFESSOR
		They are not false.  We pay for
		city government like this, you
		don't even care about the truth?!
		I killed her in the bathtub.

				NIKKO
		Why?

				CONFESSOR
		Because she was dirty, a dirty
		girl!

				NIKKO
		How?  How did you do it, Harvey?

				HARVEY
		With a knife?

				NIKKO
		Good guess, but not good enough.
		Get the fuck outta here...

	He has stood as M.J. passes coming from Quinn's office.  He
	falls into stride with her through the crowded scene... He
	is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general
	hygiene checkup...

				NIKKO
		What am I wasting my time with this
		shit for?

				M.J.
		Because it's your job, that's all.

				NIKKO
		Not what I meant; why me?

				M.J.
			(cutting)
		Maybe it's something you did in
		this life, Nikko...

	It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished
	argument... He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart.

				NIKKO
		Got me.  That really hurt!  You...

	Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away...

				M.J.
			(to Ruben)
		Get Mercer to run the medical,
		dental, legal bills, laundry and
		dry cleaning receipts, extermin-
		ators, mailmen, grocery and
		drugstore deliveries, handymen,
		plumbers...

				RUBEN
		It's mostly done, they got nobody
		in common, the three of them... No
		mutual friends -- the Landlady says
		nobody was ever there, she never
		saw her with anybody.

	They are approaching PACHULSKI'S desk.  PACHULSKI is on
	phone.  Pachulski is looking at M.J., grinning...

				PACHULSKI
			(into phone)
		Yes, ma'am, I know.  You can't talk
		her right now... because she's 
		busy, she's all tied up.
			(sotto to M.J.)
		Deep Throat's back.

	He hits the speaker phone...

				FEMALE PHONE VOICE
		This is the third one.  You've got
		a serial killer here.  When are you
		going to start warning people?

				PACHULSKI
			(whispering)
		Fourteen calls from this broad.
		And she ain't stupid.

	M.J. signals for GIGI to trace the call.  Takes the phone,
	switches off the speaker...

				M.J.
		Who is this?

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

	HELEN on phone

				HELEN
		Who is this?

				M.J.
		Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm
		in charge here.

				PACHULSKI
			(amused)
		Ask her about the moon bike.

				M.J.
		I'm really interested in your
		ideas.  The moon bike.  What is
		that?

				HELEN
		What is wrong with you people?
		The first two, I thought he might
		be on a lunar cycle because they
		were 28 days apart, but obviously
		not.  This new one is only two
		weeks.

	Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on M.J., M.J.
	not so much... Gigi signals they're getting it.

				HELEN (cont'd)
		You want to joke about moonbikes?!

				M.J.
		No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And
		neither is tying up telephone lines
		to police with crank calls while
		people in trouble are trying to get
		through for help.

				HELEN
		You're calling me a crank?

				M.J.
		Do you have any evidence to report,
		ma'am?  Do you know any of the
		victims...

				HELEN
		I think this is number three...

				M.J.
			(over her)
		That's an opinion, not evidence...

	Gigi hands her a slip of paper... M.J. reads it... glares
	at Pachulski who is still laughing.  M.J. knows the name on
	the slip of paper...

				M.J.
			(covers the phone)
		Helen Hudson.  Get Ruben back

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	HELEN, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same T-shirts
	she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains
	looking down at the street.  She hears a code knock, then a
	key turns in the lock.  She moves to greet ANDY her
	assistant and friend.  ANDY is laden down with groceries and
	mail.  HELEN immediately reaches a hand up to touch his
	face...

				HELEN
		Where were you?  Don't tell me.
		It's just under seventy, right?  The
		sun is strong but the air is dry
		and fresh...

				ANDY
		Would you please get your hands off

		to the newspaper?

	He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her.
	When she rejects it, he takes it for himself.

				HELEN
		I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

				ANDY
		Well!  Aren't we the daring one?
		What's morbid and ghastly enough in
		the news to make Doctor Helen set
		foot outside her door?  The antenna
		is gone off her car again.  I had
		no music, all the way to the
		market.  Let me find a garage for
		it?

	They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff...
	expensive goodies...

				HELEN
		I've told you:  I can't afford to
		garage it.

				ANDY
		Are you kidding?  You buy enough
		gourmet junk every week... most of
		which rots... to garage a fleet of
		stretch limos.

				HELEN
		I had the dream again.
			(beat)
		And I got another call.  This time
		he spoke.  He said "You and me, you
		and me."

				ANDY
		A little heavy breathing is what
		most of us yearn for.  Forget it.

				HELEN
		He whispered, but it was him!  I
		know it was him!

	Andy now stops to address this seriously...

				ANDY
		He can't phone you unless the
		warden gets an okay from you.  Did
		you give him an approval?

				HELEN
		Andy?  When a three-year-old says
		there's a monster under the bed,
		you don't say 'forget it'.  You
		look under the bad.
			(beat)
		I'm three years old.  Call the
		prison.

	Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it
	breaks his heart.  He puts his arms around her.

				HELEN
		Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

				ANDY
		When was the last time you washed
		your hair?

				HELEN
			(shaky, but trying)
		Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my
		coiffure?

				ANDY
		Monsieur Andy can smell your
		coiffure.  And guess what else?

	He pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...

				ANDY
		Cellulite.  What do you say I
		blindfold you and take you to the
		gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

	HELEN AT WINDOW

				HELEN
		Andy?

	Andy has heard this tone before:  panic attack alert.

				ANDY
		Here we go again.

	ANGLE AT WINDOW TO INCLUDE THEIR POV OF STREET

	In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his
	face.  Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab.

				HELEN
		You parked right behind him.  The
		one I noticed earlier.  I didn't
		say anything, I thought he'd leave.
		Just take a look.

				ANDY
		Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A
		NEWSPAPER!

				HELEN
		But earlier, he was staring up
		here.  Please, Andy.

				ANDY
		Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry'
		coming up.

	ANDY leaves the apartment.

	EXT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S BUILDING - DAY

	The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, ANDY
	peers out, sees:

	ANDY crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming
	up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver.
	THE NEWSPAPER DROPS:  IT'S RUBEN.

				ANDY
		Excuse me, but would you mind
		explaining why you're watching the
		lady upstairs?

				RUBEN
		None of your fucking business.

	Usurping RUBEN'S aggressive attitude, ANDY leans his face
	close to RUBEN'S window.

				ANDY
		Listen, asshole, I've got a gun...

	RUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the
	car.  With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up
	ANDY'S nose.

				RUBEN
		I hate this...

				ANDY
		Only kidding!

	RUBEN pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ANDY'S
	head in a deadlock.  Then he opens the door, gets out, slams
	door, forcing the squawking ANDY into a helpless frisk
	position.  We HEAR HELEN scream, (O.S.).  Ignoring this,
	RUBEN begins to frisk ANDY.

	M.J. APPROACHING IN HER OWN CAR, SEES THE ACTION, BRAKES
	FAST AND GETS OUT.

	HELEN at window, shouting.

				HELEN
		I'm calling the police!

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Andy enters, followed by Ruben and M.J., who holds up her
	badge to Helen.

				M.J.
		Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I
		apologize for Goetz, he's a
		firehouse dog.

				ANDY
			(trying to defuse)
		I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed
		it.

	Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in
	what's happening, who's who and what's what.  Helen is
	confused, fighting back fear...

				M.J.
			(trying to communicate
			 here)
		Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor
		impulse control.

				HELEN
		Is he out?

				M.J.
		Who?

				HELEN
			(to Andy)
		If he's not out, why are they here?

				M.J.
		Because of your phone calls.

				HELEN
		What calls?  I haven't made any
		calls.

				ANDY
			(to distract)
		Are you staying long?  Shall I shut
		the door?  Make your coffee?  Make
		the beds?

				M.J.
			(to Helen)
		You talked to me.  Do you remember?

	The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to
	control herself.  A beat.

				HELEN
		You were the one that talked about
		moonbikes and called me a crank?
		Oh God, I am!
			(to Andy)
		Make them some coffee.
			(to M.J.)
		Halloran, is it?  Investigator
		Goetz?  I had a crank call myself--
		he said...
			(a moment of real
			 fear)
		I thought it might be Daryll Lee
		Cullum.  I thought he might be out
		of prison.

				RUBEN
		Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think
		so.  If he's escaped we'd have the
		National Guard, cops'd be crawling
		through sewers.  You'd have a guard
		on your front door.

				M.J.
			(looking around)
		I want to tell you it's a great
		honor to meet you and talk to you.

				HELEN
		You don't admire me.  No police
		admire me.  I got one of you
		killed.  Why don't you say right
		out what you're here for?

				M.J.
		You called us, Doctor Hudson.

				HELEN
		Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control.
		The accounts of the firs two
		murders made it so clear they were
		the work of the same man, but you
		kept announcing they were
		unrelated.  You'll never catch him
		that way.

	M.J. regards her for a moment...

				M.J.
			(to Andy)
		Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take
		mine black.
			(beat)
		You're absolutely correct.  The
		politicians don't want panic
		headlines spoiling the Festival of
		Love.

				HELEN
		Well, let's thank God you and
		Inspector Goetz are on the case,
		then.

				M.J.
		Would you want to work with us on
		this?

				HELEN
		Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical
		hysteric, with panic syndrome, and
		anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm
		afraid of everything, real and
		imaginary.  I never leave this
		apartment now.  Nobody ever comes
		here.  I just wanted to get your
		attention.  I write and I used to
		lecture on these crimes, but... I'm
		not competent.

				M.J.
		I think you are.  I really admire
		everything you've done; it would be
		an honor to work with you, and we
		need all the help we can get,
		especially yours.

				HELEN
		Inspector Halloran, that is so much
		bullshit, you don't like or admire
		me, but the beautiful part is I
		don't give a fuck.  That's the
		upside of having a breakdown.

				M.J.
		Well, it's a hell of an apartment
		you got here.  I'm living one step
		away from the projects, myself, but
		I get to go to work every day,
		wading in blood and guts.  I guess
		the books you wrote about these
		sons of bitches paid off pretty
		good.

				HELEN
		Will you go.  Andy, make them go.

				M.J.
		You can't go out lecturing?  Tough
		shit.  Women are dying.  Where can
		I lay this stuff out?

	She dumps files of photos, etc., out on Helen's cocktail
	table.

				HELEN
		I don't want this.  What are they?

				RUBEN
		You called us, Doctor, if you don't
		want to look at them here, how
		about downtown.  I'll drive you
		down...

	She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up
	to leave the room.  M.J. and Ruben are both appalled at the
	force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack...

	Andy races t o the kitchen; Ruben tries to help but Helen
	fights him off viciously, gasping for air... Andy races
	back in with a PLASTIC BAG HE PULLS OVER HELEN'S HEAD AND
	FACE...  She hyperventilates into the bag...

	THE PLASTIC BAG BALLOONS OUT AND BACK IN HELEN'S FACE until
	she faints.  Andy deals with it like an everyday event,
	treating her very gently...

				ANDY
			(to Ruben)
		Now look what you did.

				RUBEN
		What did I do?

				ANDY
		You threatened to drive her
		downtown.  She has agoraphobia.

				RUBEN
		Fear of what...

				ANDY
		Open space.  She hasn't been out of
		this apartment in three years.  I
		didn't used to think it was real...

	He's making her comfortable.

				M.J.
		We'll get the paramedics...

				ANDY
		Oh, God, uniforms, more stress.
		Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting:
		she hyperventilates till she passes
		out, then her breathing goes back
		to normal, and she wakes up singing
		like a lark.
			(rocking the
			 unconscious Helen)
		We know, don't we, Princess?
			(to them)
		Give her a couple of hours.  I know
		about this.

	M.J. starts to gather up the pictures and files.  She is
	angry and disgusted.

				M.J.
		Tell her we're sorry we bothered
		her.

				ANDY
		Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you
		really want her help.  I mean if
		you really do, leave them.  Let her
		see them.  I'll see they're safe...

	M.J. takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen;
	Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos
	strewn around.  Makes a decision...

				M.J.
		Tell her to ask for me...

	She's handing Andy her card...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

	M.J. AND RUBEN come out in the street...  CAMERA IN A HIGH
	ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM...

				M.J.
		Snotty neurotic bitch...

				RUBEN
			(amused)
		Classy madonna.

				M.J.
		Sure.  She likes you, Rube.  She
		likes the way you move.  She sure
		as hell isn't in love with me.

				RUBEN
		You came in there with this
		attitude...

				M.J.
			(over him)
		Order Chinese for us and meet me
		the library?  Anything but beef.

	She jumps in her car, still steaming, leaving Ruben to move
	to his car.  AS HE MOVES CAMERA FOLLOWS, BECOMING A WIDER
	ANGLE TO INCLUDE FACADE OF HELEN'S APARTMENT.

	We can SEE ANDY, SITTING WHERE WE LEFT HIM, HOLDING HELEN IN
	HIS ARMS.  SHE SLEEPS PEACEFULLY.  DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE
	PHONE RING.  ANDY SHOWS IMPATIENCE, THEN CAREFULLY
	DISENGAGES FROM HELEN SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HER SLEEP.

	HE MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM UNTIL HE IS OUT OF FRAME.  THE SHOT
	HOLDS ON HELEN FOR A BEAT.  PHONE RINGS.

	THEN THE CAMERA PANS LEFT (OUR FIRST CLUE THIS IS ANOTHER
	POINT OF VIEW) ACROSS TO A SECOND WINDOW WHERE IT CATCHES
	ANDY MOVING UNTIL WE AGAIN DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE BUILDING
	WALL AND THE CAMERA PANS SMOOTHLY TO THE THIRD WINDOW, WHERE
	ANDY ENTERS.  WE SEE HIM PICK UP THE PHONE AND SPEAK INTO
	IT.  HE SEEMS IMPATIENT.

	THEN CAMERA PANS DOWN TO A CELLULAR PHONE, F.G. AND FOCUS
	RACKS TO E.C.U. AS A FINGER PUSHES THE "END" BUTTON.

	CLOSE: ANDY

	Putting down the phone.  Irritated...

				ANDY
		Shit...

							CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE LIBRARY - DAY

	CLOSE: AN ATTORNEY IN COURT

				ATTORNEY
		... it was your feeling after
		careful evaluation that he was a
		sexual sadist who satisfied at
		least four out of ten criteria in
		the DMS III?

	SHOW M.J. and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese
	takeout.  HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for
	Daryll Lee Cullum.  Helen sure of herself to the point of
	arrogance, which is her undoing...

				HELEN
		Yes.  Without question.

				ATTORNEY
		Without question?  He only scored
		40 percent, four out of ten
		criteria?  Couldn't another expert
		say he flunked the sexual sadist
		test?  What curve are you marking
		on, Doctor?

				HELEN
		The test criteria are only part of
		what we look at in evaluating
		subjects.

				ATTORNEY
		Only part.  What else?  What did
		you think of his claim that he tied
		this girl to the tree and set fire
		to her because Joan of Arc told him
		to do it.

				HELEN
		He was lying.

				ATTORNEY
		'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked
		you what you thought, not what he
		did.

				HELEN
		I thought he was lying.

				ATTORNEY
		You said, first, he was lying.  How
		do you know that, Doctor?

				HELEN
		Because people who are suffering
		from aural hallucinations hear
		voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee
		told me that Joan of Arc always
		appeared beside him on his left
		side and spoke softly in his left
		ear.

	Murmur of subdued laughter in court.

				HELEN
			(emboldened)
		He took pains to hide his actions
		because he knew they were morally
		wrong.  He was not acting on mad
		impulse.  He was sane and acting
		out a pattern he carefully followed
		every time.

				ATTORNEY
			(playing causal)
		What pattern was that?

				HELEN
		The same as the first time...

	She catches herself.  The D.A. has leapt to his feet, but now
	tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but
	Helen, the Attorney and the D.A. all are clearly disturbed
	by the line this questioning is taking.

				ATTORNEY
		The first what?
			(as she hesitates)
		Your Honor, she's got this far, I
		think she should finish.  I don't
		think this jury should be left
		wondering where the rest of her
		statement would lead.

				JUDGE
		I agree, Doctor.

				HELEN
		The first two murders.

				ATTORNEY
		What first two murders.  We don't
		know about them here, do we?

				HELEN
			(giving up)
		He told me he had done two others
		just like it.

				ATTORNEY
		When was that?

				HELEN
		When he was seventeen.

				ATTORNEY
		And you believed him when he told
		you he had done that.

				HELEN
		Yes.  I believed him.

	The D.A. is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge.

				JUDGE (V.O.)
		Yes, I'll accept a call for a
		mistrial.  Evidence of that other
		crime when the defendant was a
		juvenile is inadmissible and never
		should have been heard by this
		jury...

	FREEZE FRAMES.

	NOW WE SEE M.J. AND RUBEN LOOKING AT HELEN on the TV screen,
	THINKING...

	THE DOOR OPENS AND QUINN ENTERS.

				QUINN
		There was no sperm.

				M.J.
		The same as the firs two.
		Definitely a serial.

				QUINN
			(seeing HELEN on
			 video)
		What are you looking at that for?
		Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.

				M.J.
		What clues?  I'm going to work
		Helen Hudson.

				QUINN
		Would you step outside, Sergeant?

	M.J. leaves a cautiously silent RUBEN.  Once the door shuts,
	he turns tape back to 'play.'

	EXT. OUTSIDE DOOR TO LIBRARY - DAY

				QUINN
		I'm telling you.  Don't you ever
		address me publicly in that tone.
		You'll work what and who I tell you
		to work.

				M.J.
		Anybody in this department ever
		worked a serial killer case?  She's
		the expert.  I need help.

				QUINN
		How about I put Nikko on it?

				M.J.
		That's always your privilege, sir.

	QUINN snorts, starts on his way, then turns back.

				QUINN
		Sergeant?

				M.J.
		Yessir.

				QUINN
		You ever reflect how this big
		explosion in dead women coincides
		with the flowering of women's lib?

				M.J.
		Yessir.  I have reflected on that,
		sir.  Which explains my gushing
		deference to you, sir.

	QUINN is somehow cheered by this little exchange.

				QUINN
		Nikko's looking better by the
		minute, Inspector.

	He stomps off.

		Oh, God.  I must have looked

				ANDY
		No, dear.  You're at your best with
		a bag in front of your face.

				HELEN
		I want to die.

				ANDY
		I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you
		want him.  The cute brutal type
		with handcuffs.  Very sexy.

	HELEN grins, and ANDY starts to tickle her, she laughs.

				ANDY
		You thought he was cute too, didn't
		you?  Admit... admit...

	HELEN now laughing a little too hard.  Suddenly the laughter
	changes to tears.

				ANDY
		What?  What'd I do?

				HELEN
		Reminded me that I used to be
		attractive.  That men used to want
		me...

				ANDY
		You slut!  No sexy young cop for
		you unless you shampoo your hair.

	She clings desperately to him.  He rocks her as he would a
	small child.

				ANDY
		When are you going to call them?

				HELEN
			(big beat)
		About what?

	ANDY PRODUCES THE FILE M.J. LEFT WITH HIM.  Helen looks at
	it.  Andy watches her...

				HELEN
		I can't, Andy.

				ANDY
		Then, why don't you just die.  I'm
		going.  They'll find your body
		years later, the old recluse lady,
		she ate cat food, ten years of the
		New York Times, unread, piled on
		top of the unread mail, the TV
		still on.  Make up your mind.  Live
		or die.
			(beat)
		I'll get coffee.

	He exits.  After a moment fighting her fears, Helen reaches
	for the file.  She opens it and looks at the first picture.
	THE PHONE RINGS.  She freezes... Panic hangs in the air...
	Andy answers the phone in the kitchen...

				ANDY (O.S.)
		Yes?  Inspector Halloran, she's
		going through the material now.
			(beat)
		She'll call you... No, she'll be

		Well, you outranked me, Nikko.

		Yeah.  And you used that. Used me

	kneels on the grass, weeding a lush flowerbed.  The CAMERA
	SWISHHPANS TO the back door of the house as a man comes out

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

	CLOSE UP:  early crime scene photos.

	WE SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FIRST TWO MURDER VICTIMS, SO
	WE SEE THE PATTERN HELEN DESCRIBES AND ANALYZES.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		The way he's posed the bodies...
		he's flaunting his power to do
		whatever he wants to her.  This
		man... He probably seems perfectly
		normal.  These murders are organized
		and planned.

	WE ARE NOW SEEING THE ROOM:  M.J. AND RUBEN, HELEN AT A TABLE
	IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES.  Helen picks out one
	picture from the rest...

				HELEN
		Except for this one.  You put that
		one in to test me.

	M.J. nods, pleased with HELEN>

	INSERT: THE PICTURE.  The victim's body is covered with
	bruises.  But, unlike the others, her face has been covered.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Is it an ongoing case?

	BACK TO SCENE...

				M.J.
			(nods)
		For months... last October.

				HELEN
		It was a lover or a husband.
		Someone close.  Somebody who knew
		her and cared about her.

				M.J.
			(glancing at Ruben)
		How do you know that?

				HELEN
		He felt remorse.  He covered her.

	HELEN arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.

				HELEN
		The bodies have been carefully
		arranged... different positions,
		but somehow the same.  The
		positions are brutal... yet
		quite... artful.  It's like... a
		signature.  He's proud of his
		accomplishments.  There are early
		Picassos and late Picassos, but you
		always recognize the hand.  He
		wants us to recognize his hand.
		I've seen this hand before... what
		are you hiding?

				M.J.
			(taken aback)
		Nothing.

				HELEN
		Where are the stockings he
		strangled them with?

				M.J.
		How did you know they were
		stockings?

				HELEN
			(sarcastic)
		I sent Andy out on murder missions.
		For God's sake -- it's the Boston
		Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used
		their own stockings to strangle
		them.  Tied in a bow-knot.

	She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to
	pictures of deSalvo's victims:  they are identical...

				HELEN
		Somebody is imitating his m.o.
		Look for a plumber or carpenter or
		handyman; that's how deSalvo got in
		the door and caught them off guard.

				RUBEN
		The Boston Strangler, when was
		that...?

				HELEN
		In the sixties.  He's dead --
		stabbed to death in prison.

				M.J.
		Why imitate a dead serial killer?

				HELEN
		If you knew why, you might know
		where to look for him.
		I don't envy you this; he's not
		done -- he's going to do them faster
		and faster to keep the adrenaline
		rush.  Now, I've done what you 
		asked me.

				M.J.
		Work with me.

				ANDY (O.S.)
		It's good for you.

	They are startled by his appearance!  A little unsettling.

				ANDY
		It's good medicine.

				RUBEN
		A little homeopathic cure for the
		willies.

				HELEN
			(exhausted)
		None of you know anything about it.
		Now go.  And Andy, if you persist
		in playing doctor, leave, with
		them.

				ANDY
		I'm the only friend you've got,
		darling, and I don't intend to stop
		doing what I think is good for us.

				HELEN
		Get out!  All of you!

	Andy helps M.J. and Ruben scoop up the files...

				RUBEN

		I'll tell you what they teach.  On
		the knuckles they teach.

				QUINN
		Who've I got to beat up except the
		messenger?  Does this give us
		anything to go on?

				M.J.
		I'm checking out anybody who lives
		like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests
		for rape, especially by a man
		wearing green.  Checking out
		psychiatric hospitals for his
		personality profile.  Cross check-
		ing names from arrests for sexual
		offenses, public fondling.  If
		they've got a German wife.  We can
		keep cops working on this kind of
		junk for years, and this guy's
		going to hit again, soon.

				QUINN
			(morose)
		I know.  Get out here.

				M.J.
		So.  Do we tell the media and hope
		for somebody to come forward with
		information?

				QUINN
		Or for some new nutcase to copycat
		the copycat.

				RUBEN
		What I love, the big fight, some
		girl, she drops the quarter on her
		boyfriend so the bastard spends the
		night in custody, just to teach him
		a lesson.  We'll get a shitload of
		those.

				QUINN
		Another country heard from.
			(deciding)
		No.  We're keeping it quiet, don't
		give the bastard the attention he's
		maybe begging for.

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	HELEN sits at side-by-side computers.  The chess game is
	again in progress.

	HELEN makes a move.  Pleased with herself, she smiles,
	types, "I'm creaming you."

	Suddenly over HELEN'S shoulder, the other screen becomes
	active, we see 'Message for Helen Hudson.'

	Engrossed in her own chess game, she does not notice the
	screen until, tense from sitting too long, with waiting for
	CHESSMASTER'S move, HELEN begins to stretch her neck and
	toll her head.  Now, out of the corner of her eye, she sees
	the other screen.  Quickly, she clicks on this, and the
	screen prints out 'A GAME FOR DR. HUDSON PLEASE RUN THIS
	"TOMORROW.AVI" FILE ON YOUR PLAYER.'

	HELEN TYPES 'WIN' AND WINDOWS SCREEN COMES UP.  WITH THE
	MOUSE SHE CLICKS ON THE AVI PLAYER ICON, TYPES IN
	"TOMORROW.AVI" AND HITS ENTER.

	A PICTURE APPEARS: IT IS THE FACE OF THE WOMAN IN THE
	BATHTUB.  IT CHANGES AFTER A TENTH OF A SECOND MORPHING
	THROUGH A COLLAGE OF IMAGES OF TWO WOMEN.  A hand emerges
	from a breast of the other.  Two heads.  One, properly on
	its own neck, the other emerging from between two legs.
	Hands, feet, breasts, hair of two bodies mixed mischievously
	into one FINAL IMAGE OF A SECOND WOMAN ALIVE AND SMILING
	ECSTATICALLY AT THE CAMERA.  Both women wear their hair in
	long braids.

	INTERCUT WITH HELEN: APPALLED.

							CUT TO:

	ANDY LIES WITH TV ON, NAKED, GIVING HIMSELF A PEDICURE.  HE
	HAS EARPHONES TO MUFFLE THE TV SOUND.  From the dark spaces
	of the loft there

	ECHOES A SCREAM OF SHEER TERROR FROM HELEN!  After a beat from he
	realizes, tears off the earphones and bolts into the
	darkness...

	EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

	POLICE CARS DRAW UP IN FRONT, DOUBLE PARKING.  M.J. and Ruben
	jump out and walk, fast, toward the building... (Shot from
	same high angle -- the secret watcher's POV -- from which we
	saw M.J. and Ruben leave after their first visit.)

	INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY

	AS HER DOOR IS OPENED, by Andy.  Ruben and M.J. enter...

				ANDY
		She's in the office...

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE

	The computer glow, the unfinished chess game still up, and
	the RED-HEADED WOMAN'S joyful face on the other.  HELEN SITS
	IN A CHAIR WITH HER BACK TO THE SCREEN, ROCKING BACK AND
	FORTH, suppressing her fear by sheer will.  M.J. and Ruben
	enter with Andy...  they look at the face on the computer
	screen... (this is the only light in the room).

				HELEN
		That's the face of the next one
		he'll kill.

	She hasn't looked at them or the computer... SHE ROCKS...

				M.J.
		How do you know that?

				HELEN
			(can't look at it)
		Look at the bottom of the screen.
		You see the icon with the arrow
		pointing left?  Click on that...
		twice.

	RUBEN (FROM A MISSPENT YOUTH IN VIDEO ARCADES) expertly
	maneuvers the mouse and clicks on the icon as instructed.
	NOW THE ANIMATED COLLAGE PLAYS BACKWARD!  IN TENTH OF A
	SECOND STEPS WE SEE THE IMAGE OF THE RED-HEADED WOMAN MERGE
	BACKWARD THROUGH THE DISTORTED IMAGES AND BECOME

	THE DEAD WOMAN IN THE BATHTUB.

	M.J. AND RUBEN REACTING, LIGHTED BY THE GLOW FROM THE SCREEN.

				M.J.
		How did you do that?

				HELEN
		That computer's wired into
		INTERNET.

				RUBEN
		He's hacked into her Internet
		address.  He's a hacker.

				HELEN
			(rocking, rocking)
		He can get into my computer any
		time he likes!  This is exactly the
		kind of thing I didn't want to have
		happen.

				M.J.
		Can you make a copy we can show on
		our computers?

				HELEN
		It's too big a file to copy to a
		disk.

				RUBEN
		You got a tape backup, yeah, here
		lemme copy it on tape...

				M.J.
		Why would he send this to Helen
		Hudson...

				HELEN
		It's a game they like to play.
		Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung
		around the crime scene, talking to
		the cops.  This one's probably
		watching you, laughing at you.

				RUBEN
		Let me get a little action started
		here.

	M.J. nods to him to get along... He calls on his cellular
	phone while simultaneously working the computer...

				M.J.
		I'm going to put a guard on your
		door.

				HELEN
		One officer already got killed
		trying to protect me.  Please, just
		take it all away.  Leave me alone.

				M.J.
		He won't.

				RUBEN
		Look at this...

	THE COMPUTER SCREEN HAS A LEGEND ON IT:
	NOW YOU SEE ME...

	As they watch, it is replaced by:

	NOW YOU DON'T...

	AND THEN IT FADES TO BLACK...  Helen goes to the machine and
	maneuvers with mouse and keyboard.

				HELEN
		It's gone.  The file's not here.
			(to Ruben)
		What did you do?

				RUBEN
		I just started it copying to tape,
		but the tape never ran.  It just
		did that...

				HELEN
			(respect)
		He's brilliant.  This one is
		brilliant.

				M.J.
		We'll show that to...

				HELEN
		Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a
		self destruct virus into the code,
		so it would only play until we try
		to copy it.  Then it erased itself.
		Gone...
			(beat)
		Do you remember what you saw?

	M.J., RUBEN, QUINN, MAYBE OTHERS OF HIS STAFF STRIDE
	PURPOSEFULLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR, CAMERA MOVING WITH THEM...
	For a moment we won't know who Quinn is talking about...

				QUINN
		He's on the phone calling me like an
		insurance salesman soliciting my
		business, for Christ's sake.  I
		didn't tell him the three most
		over-rated things in life are young
		pussy, regular exercise and the
		F.B.I.

				M.J.
		Oh, maaaaan?!

				QUINN
		What?  I talk like a cop, this is
		the way I talk.  I can't believe
		this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy
		Assistant Director of the F.B.I.
		"Let me help you!"

				M.J.
		We could use a little help.

				QUINN
		With the F.B.I. there's no such
		thing as a little help.  They bury
		you with help.  Explain to me about
		this virus, no don't tell me about
		the virus.  Thing is, you saw it,
		the pictures.

	They pass through a door into a ROOM where the homicide team
	sit waiting... M.J. goes right into a briefing...

				M.J.
		We saw it.  The unknown target is
		kneeling, she's gardening.  Red
		hair, high cheekbones, mid-
		thirties, height I don't know,
		she's not overweight, she's
		zofting... She's in front of a

	SHE IS DESCRIBING...

				M.J. (V.O.)
		... the Marina area, there was
		earthquake damage repair on the
		house it looked like, a little
		garden.  The light was late
		afternoon.  Say about cocktail
		hour.  He was bringing out drinks,
		margaritas by the look.  So we got
		a house facing west, on the east
		side of the street.  Full sun, so
		there's no high trees or buildings,

	SUSAN SCHIFFER and her crew arrive, leaping out of their van

				HUSBAND
		Stupid goddam s-stupid p-poker

	The husband's voice follows QUINN and others as another COP
	leads them toward the back of house.

	DOOR TO BEDROOM.  QUINN AND RUBEN have stopped just inside
	door.  M.J. forced to peer around them.

	M.J.'S POV: On the bed, the RED-HEADED WOMAN'S body is
	propped up against the headboard, her knees up, her head
	fallen onto a shoulder: her pajama top has been ripped open
	and pushed up.  Knotted around her neck is a pink scarf tied
	in a huge bow under her chin.  On her feet, secured between
	her toes, is a commercial flyer advertising the Festival of
	Love.  It is brightly printed with red hearts.  It has been
	hand-lettered:

	HELL IN THE FESTIVAL OF LOVE

	CAMCORDER capturing the audience of a ROCK CONCERT in full

	seem to have some variety of refreshment... liquid or rolled.
	The CAMERA records the unsteady progress of a lovely YOUNG
	GIRL, weaving her way through the blankets and the bodies.
	She suddenly becomes aware of the camera being aimed at her.
	She stops, strikes a comically seductive pose and gives a
	big, gorgeous smile.  FREEZE FRAME.

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	ANDY answers the door.  M.J. and Ruben...

				ANDY
		She just got to sleep.  Do you have
		to tell her about it now?

				M.J.
		Tell her about what?

				ANDY
			(mock admiration)
		Gaahhd!  What a cop!  You busted
		me!
			(real)
		The new one, in the Marina.
			(to their reaction)
		She has a police radio scanner.
		It's always on.  She turns it off,
		and then she has to turn it on
		again.  She's obsessed.  She can't
		not listen to it, but she can't
		listen to it, so she makes me
		listen to it.

	HELEN APPEARS IN WHATEVER SHE SLEEPS IN.

				HELEN
		I am not going to look at any more
		pictures.  They're like a disease.
		They get into my head.  I can't get
		them out.

				M.J.
		I don't look at pictures.  I look
		at the real thing.  I don't feel
		infected.

				HELEN
		Maybe that's why you can't catch
		him.  I know what she looks like --
		the red-headed woman in my
		computer.

				M.J.
		I just came from her... here's what
		you haven't seen.

	M.J. takes out a picture of the dead RED-HEADED WOMAN.  Her
	manner is that of cop with a witness.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		A forgery of the Mary Sullivan
		murder scene, he's done it perfect.
		Except for the sign.

				HELEN
			(looking at photo)
		She probably let him in the door
		without a thought.  Where are their
		mothers?!  Where are the mothers
		that are supposed to teach them to
		be wary and to tough and not afraid
		to fight?

				M.J.
		Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the
		Festival of Love?  You make any
		sense in that?

	HELEN stares at the picture.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's
		talking to you.

				HELEN
		It's anybody connected to author-
		ity.  They write, they even knock
		on your door.  They're fans.  It
		thrills them to flirt with getting
		caught.

				M.J.
		Nobody knows you have anything to
		do with this case; nothing has been
		on TV or the news... Why would he
		want to get in your computer?

				HELEN
		Because I'm his damned pin-up girl!
		His, all of them!  They know me.
		They're in prisons with libraries,
		they collect clippings, I'm their
		worthy opponent.  You keep my name
		out of this.

				RUBEN
		Absolutely.

				M.J.
		My promise.

	Andy, who has ducked out, now reappears, dressed for a date.

				ANDY
		The moon is up, my night to howl.
		Will you be okay?

				HELEN
		Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You
		go.  Poor thing, you ought to get
		out.

				ANDY
			(to M.J.)
		Look out for her.  She's tougher
		than you think.

	He goes...

				HELEN
		I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest
		of it?

				RUBEN
		MaryJane.  We call her M.J.

				HELEN
		MaryJane.  You think that logic and
		police procedure, order and science
		and method will hold back the
		horrors of a world gone mad and the
		sickness of the night.  I did once.
		But you know how he'll get caught?
		He'll have an accident, or some cop
		will get lucky.  You can't catch
		him by being intelligent and
		working hard.  Or the worst:  there
		are dozens of women slaughtered in
		the most horrible way, month after
		month.  The news stories grow more
		grotesque and bizarre and in the
		city people lock their doors and
		windows, and hurry home before
		dark.  And then, one day, there are
		no more.  What happened?  Did he
		just stop?  Get tired and disgusted
		and decide not to kill any more?
		Did he kill himself?  Did he die in
		an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or
		get sick and die?  It's like the
		murderer walked off the edge of the
		earth.  And you never know.  But
		you keep asking yourself -- when you
		read about a new murder -- is he
		back?

	M.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's
	story.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...

				M.J.
		That's amazing.  A whole new book,
		thought up in a minute.  Very good.
			(beat)
		All I know how t do is get up,
		take a shower, and go to work.
		Hope, if he does another I'll nail
		the son of bitch, and they'll spell
		my name right in the newspaper.
		Where is Andy going?

				HELEN
		He's going home.  He slept over
		because I was a little anxious...

				M.J.
		I want a guard on you.  I'm worried
		about leaving you alone.

				RUBEN
			(to M.J.)
		We're through for the night, aren't
		we?  You go on.  Get some sleep.
		I'll stay until we can get a man
		out here and maybe catch a cab
		home.

				HELEN
		That would be much appreciated.
		Thanks.

				M.J.
			(to Helen)
		Somewhere down the line we're doing
		to find a connection between him
		and you.  I want you to worry that
		idea like a loose tooth.

	Three voices chime self-conscious 'Good-nights.'

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	THE SILENT WATCHER'S POV through the eye of the
	CAMCORDER, we catch M.J. exit HELEN'S building.  She stops
	momentarily on the sidewalk to look up at Helen's window...
	The drapes swing open.  RUBEN CAN BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING AT
	THE WINDOWS... The Camcorder zooms to a close-up of M.J.
	She gets into her car and speeds off.

	INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruben is checking the windows...

				RUBEN
		You ought to get some decent locks
		on these.  A six-year-old could get
		in here.  Much less a motivated
		man.

	At the phrase 'motivated man', HELEN looks at him boldly in the
	eye.
  				HELEN
		You and MaryJane aren't lovers.

				RUBEN
		Not yet.

	HELEN laughs.  So does RUBEN.  Her boldness, her laughter,
	attracts him.  His honesty attracts HELEN.  He feels the
	heat.

				HELEN
		Are you always so bold?

				RUBEN
		No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

	His grin says he'd select her anytime...

				RUBEN
		The problem for me is... you're in
		the witness category.
			(beat -- Jack
			 Nicholson)
		Know what I mean?

				HELEN
		Well.  Another time, then.
			(beat)
		I'll be all right.  He's not going
		to attack me; what I' m rally
		afraid of is all in my own head,
		Ruben.

	They smile ruefully at one another, and without further
	conversation, leave the bedroom.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	RUBEN is outside the door.  HELEN just inside.

				RUBEN
		They'll have a guard here tomorrow.
		I know you have the idea, but it'll
		make me feel a lot better.

	She smiles, and RUBEN turns, walks away.  She stays in the
	doorway watching his retreat.  About ten feet away, he
	suddenly stops.

				RUBEN
		Hey!

	He turns around, she is still in the doorway.  He reaches
	for his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her.

				RUBEN
		The number for my cellular.

				RUBEN
		Don't hesitate.  Anytime.  Night or
		day.  I mean that.

	He hods card out to her.  HELEN, holding onto the door
	frame, doesn't move.  RUBEN continues to extend his hand
	with the card in it.  It is a charged moment.  She is frozen
	in the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.
	HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,
	determined not to have any further mortification this night,
	she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.
	Then a second step and a third.

	Her hand touches the card, takes it.

	She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.
	What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has
	quietly and efficiently closed.  The door is locked.
	Frantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.

	HER POV:

	RUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just
	turning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first
	narrows, squeezing her in, then expands.  She is lost in the
	miles and miles of space between the two walls.

				HELEN
		Oh, God!  Help me!

	RUBEN reappears, races toward her...

				RUBEN
		Tell me what to do!

				HELEN
		I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

	She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN
	catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like
	a suspect.  He puts one hand on the back of her neck,
	spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position.  Somehow, this
	is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown
	panic...

				HELEN
		...falling... FALLING!

	He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring
	her against the feeling of free-fall.

				RUBEN
		I'm right here.  I won't let you
		fall.

	He still has a hand on the back of her neck.  Suddenly, the
	proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck.  She
	begins to hyperventilate.

				HELEN
		Don't let go... I can't breathe...
		I'll die!

				RUBEN
		Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe.
		I'll fix it...

	RUBEN takes out his gun...

				RUBEN
		Put your hands over your ears.

	RUBEN shoots off the lock.  Then he picks HELEN up and
	carries her back into her apartment.

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw
	up over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it
	to her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
	water, then watches her take the pills.  After which he
	takes the bottle and pockets it.

				HELEN
		The lock...

				RUBEN
		I'll get a locksmith.

				HELEN
		Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid
		to sleep... I don't want...him...in
		my head...

	RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa.  As her eyes
	close, RUBEN comforts her.  TV features the antics of a
	nervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.

	CLOSE UP HELEN:

	We hear a faint but impatient voice call:

				V.O.
		Peter... Peter...

							CROSS FADE TO:

	INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT

	Dim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not
	comfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.
	She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks
	older.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
	DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and
	video, on which a movie's final credits are running.

	THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON

	PETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.
	Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
	his hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts
	the tape on 'eject.'

				WOMAN
		Put in the Kevin Costner.

				PETER
		Why don't we save it for later?
		It's almost time for Letterman.

				WOMAN
		You know I don't like to watch talk
		shows by myself.  Where're you?

	He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he
	approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a
	lock of hair back from the forehead.

	She ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE
	DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.

				WOMAN
		See, now you've annoyed her.  You
		know she doesn't like you to touch
		me.
			(to dog)
		Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve
		you so much!
			(to Peter)
		Did you feed her?

				PETER
		Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's
		hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

				WOMAN
		She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed
		her?

				PETER
		She lies all the time.  Why would I
		say I fed her if I didn't?

				WOMAN
		That's what I don't know.  Why
		would you lie?  That's the
		problem... I can't understand why
		anyone would lie.

	He leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
	to her dog over the TV soundtrack.

				WOMAN (cont'd)
		You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would
		you?  Just to get Dad in trouble?
		Such a naughty widdle dog...

	HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
	small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,
	then through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the
	basement door behind him.

	THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets
	and computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a
	small TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,
	freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
	outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.

	PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
	something to turn the video back on.

	The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is
	the YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a
	table, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,
	but not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being
	asphyxiated by slow degrees.

	PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to
	repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
	toward his wife.  He whispers:

				PETER
		Didn't I promise I'd come right
		back?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN

	ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of
	glorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves
	down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom
	of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A
	few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new
	CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a
	number of unmarked cars.

	RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.

	As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH
	THE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S
	stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns
	away.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.

				RUBEN
		Up all night with a sick friend.

	NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

				NIKKO
		You dumb son of a bitch!  You don't
		even know how to treat a woman.

				RUBEN
		Who?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to
		me why she gave you the boot...

	He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
	WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is
	now tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath
	a sign that says "NO DUMPING".  The usual technicians,
	photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.

				RUBEN
		Is Niccoletti assigned here?

				M.J.
			(angry about it)
		Quinn decided we should form a task
		force -- they're all one case, now.
		He wants all the senior detectives
		on it...
			(to Doc)
		She wasn't killed here.

				DOC
		Not likely.

	M.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels
	beside her... to Ruben...

				M.J.
		Tell me what you see.

	He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.

				RUBEN
		She didn't fight back, no hair or
		skin under her fingernails.  I'm
		not seeing any bruises or
		contusions...

				M.J.
		What about her arms?

				RUBEN
		Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at
		this...

	Nikko appears, looming over her...

				NIKKO
		Probably so stoned she never knew
		what got her.  Like Goetz's sick
		friend.  Right Goetz?

	They ignore him.  M.J. stands...

				RUBEN
		She's blue as hell.  No marks on her
		neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same --
		no ligature marks.  Outdoors...

				M.J.
		Look at her legs.

				RUBEN
		Spread out like she was sexually
		assaulted here.

				DOC
		After she was dead.

				RUBEN
		She was dragged up here from the
		road, you can see the tracks.  She
		was already dead or unconscious.
		Let's get plaster casts on any --
		all footprints.

				M.J.
		If this is just the dump site,
		where did he do the job?  Where did
		he pick her up?

				NIKKO
		Doped up kids all over town.  Park
		was full of them last night.  Very
		easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

	Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes
	Ruben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between
	them.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...

				M.J.
		What the hell are you doing?  The
		Mouth and the Haircut are right
		down there, thank God they didn't
		see that.

	Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-
	of-Lovers.

				M.J.
		Niccoletti, they're on the wrong
		side of the tape, you want to push
		them back?  Now.

	Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for
	RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow
	her back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the
	hillside to their cars...

				M.J.
		Ruben, my God, I ought to put you
		on report.

				RUBEN
		You're right.  I can't stand that
		bastard.  Sorry.
			(getting back to
			 work)
		This is something new.  Not the
		same guy, that's for sure.

				M.J.
		Yeah, everything's different.

	But she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:

				M.J.
		Get the pictures, and casts of
		footprints.

				RUBEN
		Look at him, grandstanding...

	Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff...

				M.J.
		That's all we need...

	She strides toward them...

				M.J.
		Detective Niccoletti?

				SUSAN
		What's this about the Boston
		Strangler, M.J.?

	M.J. looks at Nikko.  He should know better.  She's also
	thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at
	this point -- or not?

				M.J.
		Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on
		the wrong side of the tape.  We're
		still trying to find any footprints
		or tire marks and we don't want to
		chew up the ground, okay?  I'll
		talk to you later.
			(to Nikko)
		You, too.

	She's got Susan outside the tape...

				SUSAN
		Inspector, will you confirm
		somebody is copying the Boston
		Strangler?  This is the fourth, is
		that correct?

				M.J.
		We're going to review all the
		evidence carefully before making
		any statement...

	She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other
	side.  Susan races for her silver Audi...

				M.J.
		Ruben, put the light on...

	From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm
	clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.

	M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster
	car, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,
	trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the
	familiar San Francisco chase scenes.

				M.J.
		Now listen up, Ruben.  You never,
		never, never mess with somebody
		inside the case!

				RUBEN
		Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  What do
		you...

				M.J.
		You damn well better start working
		on that impulse control.  A woman
		who is implicated in this case?
		Someone who's practically a piece
		of evidence?

				RUBEN
		It's against your rules that I try
		to help a witness who's scared
		shitless?  Who's...

				M.J.
		The woman's unstable.  You could
		wind up with a harassment charge.
		Anything.  You're like some horny
		little teenager.

	M.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view
	mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
	tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.

				M.J.
		Anybody who's ever watched TV knows
		about that corner.

	Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

				M.J.
		Everybody could see you -- unshaved,
		same clothes from yesterday,
		reeking of sex.

	RUBEN'S eye-brows lift.  She peels into the HQ parking lot
	and jumps out.

				M.J.
			(going away)
		Park the car.  Call the lab.  Get
		Doc to lean on the coroner for a
		really fast prelim on the sperm.

	RUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...

				M.J. (O.S.)
		When you get it, call me.

	RUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.

				RUBEN
		She loves me.

				QUINN
		She left you, Nikko.  She's not

				NIKKO
		We were together six years, sir!

				NIKKO
		She knows I'm Catholic!  She never

		Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare

				NIKKO
		I don't want the job.  Don't do

	A couple of Cops, maybe male and female, are smoking there.
	Quinn gives them a look that sends them scuttling inside,

	of his trying to give it up and not being able to, etc.

				QUINN
		So what have we got?

				M.J.
		It's not the same guy.  It should be

		completely different.  The others
		were housewives, secretaries, he

				HELEN
		You're fired.

				M.J.
		We've got another one.

				HELEN
		That's no surprise.

		But it's a different m.o.

				HELEN
		Then what do you need me for?

				M.J.
		She was killed somewhere else and

		Artificial and posed... Something's
		wrong with it.

				HELEN
		You're saying it's the same man,
		but he's changed his style?  That
		doesn't happen.  These men are
		robotic; the murder is like a

	They've turned into the office.  Something is wrong...

				M.J.
		Who turned off the Internet

				HELEN
		I turned it off.  It's like an open

	M.J. mumbles a surprised yes.  Helen is at computer.

				HELEN
		There were needle marks.  But no

				HELEN
		He's switched from DeSalvo to the
		Hillside Strangler.  The Strangler
		was two men, that's why there are
		two kinds of sperm.  His idea of a

				M.J.
		That's not consistent... You said
		they never changed their style,
		they're robots...

				HELEN
		Consistency is the hobgoblin of

		That's a product for cleaning

				M.J.
		I know Windex, for God's sake, I

				HELEN
		It's what Bianchi and Buono
		injected into one of their victims.

				M.J.
			(sensing something
			 appalling)
		Injected Windex!  Why would he
		switch to a new m.o.?

				HELEN
		Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half
		way to nailing him.  Serial killing
		is irrational and rigid and 
		compulsive.  This guy has a plan
		all thought out, flexible and
		complex.  He's playing a game with
		us.  Who will he imitate next?
		Maybe he's doing all the serial
		killers in history, the great
		innovators, the murderers' hall of
		fame.  Just to prove he's better
		than all of them.  They got caught;
		he didn't.

				M.J.
		He'll get caught.  If he has a plan
		that'll be what trips him up...

				HELEN
		Who's going to catch him?  You?
			(beat)
		And if you do, there'll be another

				M.J.
			(gently, surprised)
		You're afraid of him.

	corner of Helen's left eyes.  As he does so, a red dot
	appears near the corner of the left eye of the Red-headed

	SUDDENLY BEGINS TO RACE ALONG BEHIND THE ONLOOKERS?  THE MEN
	WHO DUCKS TO TIE HIS SHOE WHEN A PHOTOGRAPHER SHOOTS A
	PICTURE?

	INT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The horn blares across the street, (O.S.).  No one notices
	the MAN at HELEN'S door, swiftly fiddling the lock with a
	ring full of burglars' keys and picks.

	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN is putting on makeup (Ruben is coming).  A small but
	alarming noise at the front of the loft.  She listens
	carefully, and moves to the door looking down the hall
	toward the front door.  It is OPEN"  Burt is not there!

	She hesitates a moment, then turns off the lights and
	sprints for the front door, to escape.

	INT. LIVING ROOM

	THE MAN IS PULLING A BALACLAVA UP OVER HIS FACE.  AS HE HEARS
	HER HE STEPS TO THE...

	INSERT: TELEPHONE

	A HAND IN A FINE LEATHER BLACK GLOVE LIFTS THE RECEIVER OFF
	THE HOOK.

	HELEN RUNS DOWN THE HALL AND REACHES THE FRONT DOOR.  SHE
	RUNS RIGHT OUT INTO THE HALL A FEW STEPS BEFORE RECOILING:

	HER POV.  THE WALLS AND FLOOR WEAVING AND CONTRACTING...
	AGORAPHOBIA HAS HIT.

	HELEN FALLS.  SHE SCRAMBLES IN TERROR BACK TO THE "SAFETY"
	OF HER WALL, NOW A CAVE OF DARKNESS.

	SHE FALLS ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL, GASPING FOR BREATH.

	LIVING ROOM.  THE MAN MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM TOWARD THE
	HALL.

							CUT TO:

	RUBEN:  taking the hills fast.

	THE MAN: STEPS OUT INTO THE HALL.

	HELEN:  SHE HAS RUN BACK THE LENGTH OF THE HALL TO HER
	OFFICE.  SHE IS JUST VANISHING AS THE MAN STEPS TO WHERE HE
	CAN SEE HER.

	THE MAN STARTS TO FOLLOW, NOT FAST, BUT WITH TERRIFYING
	SURENESS...

	THE POLICE SCANNER SUDDENLY COMES UP LOUD.  HE HESITATES.

	HELEN:  HER REMOTE CONTROLS IN HAND SWITCHES ON TV SETS,
	LAMPS, ETC.

	THE MAN:  HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN, TOWARD WHERE HE BELIEVES
	SHE IS.  HE IS PASSING A WINDOW, WHEN THE CURTAINS SUDDENLY
	DRAW, RIGHT BESIDE HIM.  HE PAUSES AGAIN, LOOKS DOWN AND WE
	AND HE/WE SEE THE STREET SCENE: BURT AND NEIGHBORS TRYING TO
	SILENCE THE CAR ALARM.  THEN HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN.

	THE CURTAINS CLOSE.

	HIGH ANGLE OVER THE MAZE OF THE APARTMENT WALLS.  WE CAN SEE
	THE MAN MOVING ALONG THE HALLWAY AGAIN -- TOWARD ANDY'S DEN,
	AND DIRECTLY TOWARD WHERE WE LAST SAW HELEN.

	SUDDENLY, FOREGROUND, HELEN'S HEAD POPS UP, HUGE!  SHE IS
	WRESTLING HERSELF UP OVER THE WALL TOWARD CAMERA, INTO
	ANOTHER ROOM OUT OF HIS PATH.  WE PAN WITH HER AS SHE WIGGLES
	HERSELF OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND UNTIL SHE FALLS INTO
	FURNITURE, MAKING A HUGE NOISE.

	MAN STOPS, TRYING TO LOCATE DIRECTION.  HE DECIDES.  LEAPS
	WITH CATLIKE GRACE ONTO A PIECE OF FURNITURE AND FROM THERE
	ONTO THE TOP OF THE WALL!

	NOW HE STANDS ON THE PARTITION, LOOKING AROUND AT THE
	GROUNDPLAN (AS IT WERE) OF THIS APARTMENT MAZE FROM A HIGH
	ANGLE POV.

	HELEN:  SHE CROUCHES IN HIDING.  IN DEEP FOCUS, BEYOND HER,
	AND HIGH ABOVE HER, WE SEE THE MAN SILHOUETTED AS HE BEGINS
	TO WALK ALONG LIKE A CAT ON A GARDEN WALL, ABLE TO SEE ON
	BOTH SIDES INTO WHATEVER ROOMS HE IS PASSING.

	HE DROPS OFF THE WALL FOR A MOMENT INTO HER BEDROOM.
	INTERCUT MAN AND HELEN.  HE LOOKS FOR HER, PRODS THE BED
	COVERS.

	THEN LEAPS BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL.

	SHE TAKES A VASE AND THROWS IT OVER THE WALL INTO THE
	ADJACENT ROOM.  THE MAN'S FIGURE DOESN'T EVEN SLOW, HE'S
	ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT:  HE LEAPS CLEAR ACROSS AN OPENING
	ONTO THE WALL THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO HER.

	SHE HITS THE REMOTE:  THE CURTAINS SWEEP OPEN, AND MORE LIGHT
	COMES IN NOW FROM THE STREET.

	CLOSE, THE MAN: HIS FACE TURNS TO THE LIGHT: FROM THIS HIGH
	ANGLE WE AND WE SEE DOWN INTO THE STREET, WHERE

	RUBEN'S CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP.  RUBEN charges into the
	building.

	BURT, COMING AWAKE, FOLLOWS RUBEN up the stairs three at a
	time.

	HALLWAY AND APARTMENT DOOR:  THE MAN COMES RACING OUT AND
	TURNS TOWARD THE STAIRS, JUST AS RUBEN REACHES HELEN'S
	FLOOR.  THE MAN TRIES TO DO A 180, BUT RUBEN THROWS A BODY
	BLOCK AND THE MAN FALLS BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

	LIGHT FROM HALL GIVES US OUR FIRST LOOK AS RUBEN TEARS THE
	BALACLAVA OFF HIS FACE.  He is a middle-aged Afro-Asian with
	a knife-scarred face.

				MAN
		I can explain!

				RUBEN
		The fuck you can!
			(shouts)
		Helen!  Are you okay?  HELEN!

	Then he sees her.  In shock, she stares down at the MAN.

				RUBEN
		Did this animal touch you?

	She shakes her head, turns and runs out of the room, as
	RUBEN catches sight of BURT.

				RUBEN
		Turn on a light and call in the
		unit.  NOW!

	BURT rushes to okay.  RUBEN FRISKS THE MAN.

				MAN
		No gun!

				RUBEN
		Bullshit's gonna get your balls
		stomped on!  What's your name?

				MAN
		Chow.  Conrad Chow.

	The improbability of this name makes RUBEN deliver an angry
	kick to the man's side.

				MAN
		Swear to God!  Conrad Chow.  Never
		carry a gun.

				BURT
		Backup's here...

				RUBEN
			(to Burt)
		Then you get your ass outta here, I
		don't wanta see you again...

				CONRAD
		I brought a present for the lady,
		there.  I'm looking for her, to give
		her the present...

				RUBEN
		You break into her apartment to
		deliver a gift?  Where is it?

				CONRAD
		The door was open, swear to God,
		I'm just looking for her when you
		come charging up the stairs...

				RUBEN
		Where is it?

				CONRAD
		I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the
		lady's pillow...

	Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands.

	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruben comes running in, sees a parcel lying on pillow... 
	scoops it up, and rips it open.  It's a book.  He returns
	to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police.  Ruben holds the
	book up like a question.

				CONRAD
		Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that
		book, he wanted the lady to have
		it.  They won't let him send it to
		her, so I'm getting out, he asks me
		to deliver it in person, he says,
		put it on her pillow.  It has all
		about how he tried to kill her.

				RUBEN
		He told you she was loaded, any-
		thing you could steal you could
		keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself
		a return ticket to Quentin,
		breaking and entering.

				CONRAD
		The door was already open...

				RUBEN
		We know...
			(to a cop)
		Send the book to evidence...

				CONRAD
		She's supposed to have it.

				RUBEN
		She don't want it.

	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her
	chest.

				RUBEN (V.O.)
		Helen?  Open the door.  The guy's
		nothing.  A burglar.

	She sits there, says nothing.

				RUBEN (V.O.)
		Open the door.  Please.

				HELEN
		Why don't you shoot off the lock?

	She starts to laugh.  The sound is awful.  After a moment,
	she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door.  RUBEN takes
	her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it.  Wets a
	washcloth, goes to sponge off her face.  She is trembling.

				HELEN
		He was in my apartment!

				RUBEN
		I know, baby.  I know.

	Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,
	she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down
	the hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around
	her.

				RUBEN
		It's okay... you're safe with me!

	He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight
	around her, holding her still.  He smoothes her hair, rubs
	her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.

				RUBEN
		When I was a little kid, and I'd be
		in a state, my father would hold me
		on his lap, until all the fight
		would go out of me...

	She breaks free and whacks him across his nose.

				HELEN
		You think you're my Daddy?

	There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that
	RUBEN kisses her.  She goes limp, kisses him back, then
	she's suddenly sobbing.  His nose is bleeding, but she's
	smiling.  Something between them has finally connected.
	Been agreed upon.

				RUBEN
		Helen...honey, you know I gotta go.

	He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.

				RUBEN
		You know how to use this?

				HELEN
		They taught me at the FBI.  I was
		very good at it.  It scared me... I
		liked it.

				RUBEN
		You take it, hang on to it, it'll
		make you feel safer.  Stay put.

				HELEN
		What else?

	He goes.

	A SONG BEGINS, PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES:  "MURDER BY
	NUMBERS" BY THE POLICE...

		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art..."

	HELEN OPENS THE WEAPON, SEEMINGLY COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HANDLE
	IT WELL, AND EMPTIES OUT THE BULLETS.  SHE LOCKS IT UP AND
	HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF.

	THE SONG CONTINUES...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	THE FBI ARRIVES.  High angle, looking down: three identical
	cars draw in front, park with military precision: all four
	doors on the all three cars open at the same time and
	identically dressed men, in suits, get out, slam the doors
	in sync., and march toward the front steps to HQ, ignoring a
	couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk...

	INT. POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS

	As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down
	the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing
	a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
	continue away from CAMERA down another corridor.  Through
	the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
	pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between
	cops and FBI.  The cops are at ease; bellies slop over
	belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat
	stains; shirtsleeves.  The marching men wouldn't sweat.

	QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving.  He
	gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals
	a few top officers to follow.  He looks resigned...

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)

	M.J., RUBEN, NIKKO, and a number of other officers are being
	addressed by SAKS, an FBI agent.  At the back are three more
	FBI AGENTS, suited and tied.  QUINN stands off to one side.
	THE SONG IS JUST ENDING, ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM.  A
	projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
	phone booth.

		Dr. Hudson:  Don't lose your head.
		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art.
		Well, if you have a taste for this experience
		You're flushed with your very first success
		Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
		Before your conscience bothers you much less.
		Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious
		In history's great dark hall of fame
		All of our greatest killers were industrious
		At least the ones that we all know by name."

	SAKS speaks...

				SAKS
		Hello.  I am (research title)
		Meryhew Saks.  The song is called
		"Murder By Numbers."  The
		performers are a group called The
		Police.  Adam here...
                ... from Behavioral Science is
		working out exactly what this
		perpetrator is trying to telegraph
		in the note.  This is an extremely
		complex case, and we have a lot of
		fancy theories floating around.
		We're not ruling out the possib-
		ility of three Copycat serial
		killers.  We have Quantico working
		on graphology, the Washington lap
		is cloning DNA from the secretor.
		It's our feeling that the best lead
		we have is the two sperm samples in
		one of the victims.  We have a team
		sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want
		to say a few word to you local
		people.  Your Commissioner asked
		for our assistance.  The Bureau
		does not send us in on these cases
		to lord it over the local police.
		We couldn't catch up on what you
		people know if we had a year.  We
		have nation-wide resources and hard
		state of the art forensic science;
		you have the local savvy.  Together
		we can be unbeatable.  Which one is
		Inspector Halloran?

				M.J.
		Over here.

	SAKS approaches M.J., guides her away from the others.
	TWO SHOT:  Saks is unctuous and insincere, self-confident.

				SAKS
		We don't see too many lady homicide
		detectives.  You have my respect.
		Have you discussed the note with
		Dr. Hudson?

				M.J.
		Someone broke into her place last
		night.  It wasn't connected to our
		case, but it shook her up pretty
		bad so I haven't...

	QUINN joins them, SAKS gives him a nod.

				SAKS
		I was just about to advise the
		Inspector here not to show Dr.
		Hudson the note.

				M.J.
		Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a
		pattern develop...

				SAKS
			(riding over her)
		We know Helen.  She's not exactly a
		credible collaborator.  Especially
		late in the day...

				M.J.
		She takes tranquilizers her doctor
		prescribes.

				SAKS
		Who prescribes the brandy?

	M.J.'S look makes SAKS smile.  QUINN is called to the phone.

				M.J.
		How come you're so up on Dr.
		Hudson?

				SAKS
		She is a writer, writing best
		selling books about serial killing.
		Giving lectures she's well-paid
		for.  Her interests are not the
		interests of law enforcement.

				M.J.
		Okay.

				SAKS
		We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's
		phone.  I know you won't mention
		it.

	So much for any trusting relationship, right?  QUINN has
	arrived, addresses SAKS.

				QUINN
		Sorry to interrupt.  I need a word
		with my officer...

	He turns to M.J.  Diplomatically, SAKS moves away.

				QUINN
		M.J., I'm going to have to borrow
		Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing
		in Chinatown is going down tomorrow
		night and Jack's kid got hit by a
		car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.

				M.J.
		What does this mean?  Now we got
		the FBI, my team is expendable?
		I'm working my ass off, is anybody
		listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He
		and Nikko don't even get on
		together...

				QUINN
		Teach both of them a lesson in
		cooperation and self-discipline.

				M.J.
		If this is a first step in kicking
		me off the case, just tell me, to
		my face, sir, don't waste time
		being diplomatic.

				QUINN
		Just, I need results.  And -- I am
		short-handed.  Who else am I gonna
		give him?

				M.J.
			(looking at Saks)
		Give him thatpompous son of a
		bitch.

	She turns and leaves, brushing past Saks as she goes... Gigi
	meets her...

				GIGI
		Lab called.  They got a result on
		the drug test you requested...?

	It takes a moment to remember what it was...

				GIGI
		They said it was Windex?

	If there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's
	gone now.  She starts after Quinn, sees he is in spirited
	dialogue with SAKS and decides to wait.

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	HELEN and M.J.  Helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note, that
	M.J. has just given her.

				HELEN
		..."I'll be back..."

	As she looks at the back of the note... she looks up into
	M.J.'S face.

				M.J.
		Yeah.  Addressed to you.  "Don't
		lose your head."

	Helen puts down the note.  She is holding herself together
	by main will power... doesn't want to face that note...

				HELEN
		They put  Merry Saks on it?!

				M.J.
		He said to send you his regards and 
		to tell you that the Bureau holds
		you in the highest esteem.

				HELEN
		What I can't believe is that in an
		earlier life I slept with him!
		Christ!  Any God that loved his
		people would give women a rewind on
		their life and an erase button.
			(looks at M.J.)
		Just give me a minute here.  The
		letter is addressed to me...
			(she's breathing
			 fast, controls it)
		You don't feel fear, do you?
		You're young.  You feel like you'll
		live forever.  How wonderful.

				M.J.
		I put my ass on the line, giving
		you that.

				HELEN
		They weren't going to show it to
		me?!  The arrogance!  It's my life!

				M.J.
		It's also the major piece of
		evidence, and it makes you a key
		part of his plan.  You can't run
		away from it anymore.
			(beat)
		Look at the order he's doing
	them... He did three as the Boston
		Strangler just to tell us a copycat
		serial killer was at work.  Then he
		did one like the Hillside Strang-
		ler.  And then one as Son of Sam.
		To lead us on -- to where and what
		end?  And he's doing more than that
		-- he's imitating each killer's
		method as closely as he can -- in
		details.  Injecting Windex.  Using
		.44.  Playing Abba.

				HELEN
		It's not chronological: Son of Sam
		was before Hillside.

	She begins to read.

				M.J.
		It's clear he thinks he knows me.
		He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't
		lose your head.'  Is that a threat?
		Does he want to cut off my head?
		Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else?
		Kemper.  Did Gacy?  Rivkind?  I
		think Rivkind did.

	She puts the note down on the table, smoothes it out.  She
	closes her eyes for a moment.  We begin to see certain
	filtered images.  As they come, we INTERCUT them.

				HELEN
		He attacks what he feels he can't
		have.  What he feels excluded
		from...

	EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

	Lush, pastoral green.  We see PETER sitting by himself.  He
	wears a WHITE LAB COAT, like one we saw hanging in his
	basement.

	HIS POV:  of students on the green, playing Frisbee,
	studying together, picnicking.  Women sunbathe, their straps
	pulled down on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to
	expose their midriffs.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		'First you make a stone of your
		heart.'... Oh yes!  He doesn't
		suffer.  That's past.  Now it's our
		turn.

	One of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round, then
	takes her top off entirely.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Kemper said in order to have the
		experience he wanted with them, he
		needed to evict them from their
		bodies.  By making the body a
		completely passive object, he
		releases himself from passivity.

	CLOSE:  HELEN, DEEP IN THOUGHT...

				HELEN
		But the relief he feels is only
		temporary.  '...Before your
		conscience bothers you much
		less...'  But the tension always
		comes back.
			(she now picks out
			 the words:)
		'You can join the ranks of the
		illustrious...'  He wants to be
		like them.  The best.  To become
		the best.  But, he has his own
		desires, his own compulsions apart
		from theirs.'  His own horrors...

	FLASHBACK: PETER'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

	An incremental flash of a SMALL BOY standing by his bed
	which he has wet.  His pajamas are soaked.  His powerful
	MOTHER grabs him by the hair and drags him with her.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Some horrors that are all his
		own...

	The SMALL BOY is flung into an under-stairs closet where
	firewood and stacked papers are kept.  The door is slammed
	hard.  He gropes around in the darkness, finds a big box of
	matches, lights one.  Then, angrily, he sets fire to a pile
	of newspapers.  They start to burn.  We see, but do not,
	hear, his screams for help.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		He needs to prove they don't
		control him, that he's the one in
		control.  But the feeling of power
		never lasts.  He can control his
		victims, but he can't control
		anything else... his place in the
		world.  He want s to be recognized.
		He puts messages in my computer; he
		sends me a letter...

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	She picks out the lines... "then you must try a twosome or a
	threesome."

				HELEN
		Of course he wants to do a

		one day.  Is Bundy next?  But Bundy
		should be last... the grand finale.
		What about Kemper and Ramirez?
		Gacy, Dahmer, Williams?  Rivkind?
		Who else is on his list?  In what

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	PETER in his car.  Ahead, he see TWO GIRLS at a bus stop.
	We see PETER take a long bladed-knife and carefully conceal
	it under his right thigh.  The TWO GIRLS are wearing
	backpacks.  'FESTIVAL OF LOVE' stickers decorate the bags.
	PETER pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says
	something.  They giggle, shake their heads.  He laughs,
	holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a 'Not

				HELEN (O.S.)
		It's not a real name: it's the name
		of a mass murderer in Germany in
		the 1930s.  They called him the
		Monster of Dusseldorf.

	M.J. is turning into the Office; she carries a portfolio of
	lists of her own.

				HELEN
		Let's speed up the game plan...
		call all the living serials to ask
		if they've had contact with a Peter
		Kurten.  We could use some help on
		the phones...

				M.J.
		They're not talking to me.  Saks
		looks right through me.  I ask him
		for some bodies, for the phones --
		he's so encouraging: "you make that
		your little job."  Condescending
		bastard.
			(careful)
		Helen, on your lists to call is San
		Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?

				HELEN
			(beat)
		You do that one, I don't want it...

							CUT TO:

	INT. SAN QUENTIN WARDENS' OFFICE

				MITCHELL
		Sergeant Halloran is it?  I've
		got a list of Daryll Lee's
		correspondents.  There is a
		Peter Kurten among them.
		Daryll Lee claims he has
		information about Kurten, but
		he'll only talk to Dr. Hudson
		personally.  Nobody else.  The
		creep's been studying his
		amendments.  My guess is he
		doesn't have zip.  Just
		angling for a chance to ask if
		her bra size is still the
		same.  We get this shit all
		the time, but it's her call.

				M.J.
		Thanks, Warden.
			(determined)
		She'll talk to him.

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	HELEN, M.J.  They are waiting, Helen tense, smoking,
	atmosphere charged...

				M.J.
		Do those things really help?

	Like she really wished they might, so she could have one.
	Helen looks at her cigarette as though she'd never seen one
	before... grinds it out...

				HELEN
		Not a damn bit...

	And unconsciously lights another during following...
	PHONE RINGS.  M.J. PICKS IT UP, LISTENS, HANDS IT TO HELEN...
	Gestures encouragement; fist in victory gesture...

							INTERCUT TO:

	INT.  PENITENTIARY INTERVIEW ROOM

	DARYLL LEE CULLUM is on the phone, a Warden is attendance,
	but not on the phone line.  On this rare contact with the
	outside world HE IS MANIC...

				DARYLL LEE
		Hey, Doc!  How you doing?

	She turns on speakerphone.

				HELEN
		Hello, Daryll Lee.

				DARYLL
		You read my book which as you know,
		hit the stands a couple of weeks
		ago.  You read it yet.

				HELEN
		What book?

				DARYLL
			(indignant)
		I sent it by private courier, he
		didn't give it to you?  That son of
		a gun...!

	Helen looks at M.J., who indicates 'tell you later.'

				HELEN
		I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.

				DARYLL
		Bet you never figured I'd follow in
		your footsteps.  It's real well-
		written.  You should read it --
		you're in it.

				HELEN
		I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and
		talk to you about it after I've
		read it.  Right now I have a
		question... Peter Kurten.

				DARYLL
		Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I
		told that son I'd send him what he
		wanted if he leave you alone.

				HELEN
		Ah ha.  What did he want?

				DARYLL
		Something personal.  Is he bothering
		you?

				HELEN
		I don't know.  I'd like to know
		where he is.

				DARYLL
		Listen, you want my advice?  Steer
		clear.  He's writing me he's gonna
		finish 'my unfinished symphony.'
		He's gonna give me $550 for some of
		my cum, he says he's in a position
		to see that I will be immortal if
		he has some of my spunk.  I'm
		offended.  Right away I smell
		freak.  Writin' about him and me
		and you bein' joined and he's gonna
		finish my symphony?  I didn't care
		for his drift.  I sent some liquid
		soap in a sandwich baggie with a
		message from Jesus to mend his
		ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And
		what's funny is, now I don't mind
		bein' inside.  If I was out, even
		Born Again, I'd probably get
		restless again.  It's maybe better
		I stay here, what do you think?

				HELEN
		I think whatever is best for you,
		Daryll.  And maybe you're right,
		that's the place.

				DARYLL
		You come and visit.

				HELEN
		Where did you send the message to
		Peter Kurten?

				DARYLL
		Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too!
		That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to
		Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in
		return for getting my book to you.

	At this mention of Conrad, M.J. leaps to another phone...

				HELEN
		How was Conrad supposed to find
		Kurten?

				DARYLL
		Conrad has the phone number.
		Conrad, where is he?

				HELEN
			(from M.J.'s pantomime)
		In jail.

				DARYLL
		That Klutz.  They send him back
		here, I'll kick his ass good.

				DARYLL LEE
		Helen, how is life, you okay?  Come
		see me, talk to me.  I think about
		you, worry about you all the time.
		I am so glad Jesus didn't let me
		kill you.  You know -- you're
		blessed by Jesus.  That's why you
		need to come talk to me, because
		Jesus kept you alive for a reason,
		and I was his sacred instrument...
		In the moment Satan was in my heart
		raising my hand to kill you, Jesus
		took my hand to spare you.  I am
		both death and life to you...

	Helen hangs up.  M.J. has already left...

							CUT TO:

	INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

	Pandemonium: the Chinatown raid has been carried off and
	NIKKO AND RUBEN and a dozen other cops are booking a group
	of Chinese gangsters of all ages, and a group of frightened
	and confused Chinese illegal aliens.  TOTAL UPROAR.

	THROUGH IT, WE MOVE WITH M.J.  SHE PASSES RUBEN WHO IS
	GRABBING A CHINESE KID STRUNG OUT ON SOMETHING, OUT OF A
	LINE OF SUSPECTS... HE ASIDES:

				M.J.
		I brought back a gin-seng popper
		for you.  Guaranteed all-night
		orgasms.

				M.J.
		Save it for Helen.

				RUBEN
			(enough already!)
		Wait a minute, wait a goddamn
		minute...

	He manhandles the KID INTO DOCILITY WHILE...

				RUBEN
		The woman was in shock.  She was
		totally out on ranks.  I stayed
		because I didn't want her to wake
		up alone in a place where she'd
		just been under attack.
			(to the Kid who is
			 restless)
		Stop that, you son of a bitch!
			(back to her)
		The place wasn't secure.  I was
		doing my goddamn job!  And, for the
		second time, I slept in her living
		room.

				M.J.
		Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't
		have the face for it.  I need you
		to help interrogate the burglar in
		Hudson's place...

				RUBEN
		Talk to Nikko...!

	SHE MOVES ON TO FIND NIKKO

	NIKKO sites at his desk, processing the papers for the sullen
	YOUNG THUG who is handcuffed to a chain next to NIKKO'S
	desk.  Nikko  unholsters his gun... he shoves it into his
	desk drawer...

				NIKKO
		You speak English?
			(Chinese)
		You need an interpreter?

	QUINN, walking past the ILLEGALS, speaks to GIGI.

				QUINN
		I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted
		just the bastards dumping them in
		the harbor.  What's keeping those
		bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in
		here...

	M.J. STANDS OVER NIKKO

				M.J.
		I gotta have Ruben, and a...

	HARROWING SCREAM!!!  ILLEGAL WOMAN IS SCREAMING --
	PANDEMONIUM AMONG THE DETAINEES.  COPS RUSH TO CONTROL THE
	PROBLEM.

				NIKKO
		Outta your mind?  Look at this...

				M.J.
			(to Quinn)
		Lieutenant...?

	Just at that moment the kid Ruben was booking goes totally
	bananas; M.J. goes to his assistance, wrestling this wild
	kid.

	NIKKO starts from his chair, looking for the key to the
	drawer, but is isn't there... he goes to help Ruben get the
	kid under control.  Quinn steps in...

				M.J.
		The prowler in Hudson's apartment
		turns out to have a meeting with a
		suspect...

				QUINN
			(amazed)
		You got a suspect...

	THEY MOVE BACK TO NIKKO'S DESK.

				QUINN
		How'd you get in on the deal?

				M.J.
		I'm gonna drop charges on the
		break-and-enter at Hudson's...

				QUINN
		You have no authority to make a
		deal like that.  That' s for the
		D.A...

				M.J.
		Or the F.B.I.?

				QUINN
		Saks.  If he knew you did that!
		They're all asking me, 'what is she
		doing,' as it is.

				M.J.
		Give me Ruben back...

				QUINN
		Nikko?

				NIKKO
		We get through this shit, let 'em
		all go.

	NIKKO has stood and moved the handcuffed THUG toward the
	door to jail cells.  M.J. checks her time, (WALL CLOCKS HELP
	US HERE:  8:47)

				M.J.
		I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll
		be in the jail when you wind this
		up...

				RUBEN
		I gotta get something to eat, I
		haven't eaten all day.

	M.J. goes... RUBEN can't find a desk to work at, and
	commandeers Nikko's.  He slams the KID into NIKKO'S chair
	and cuffs him.  KID starts to rattle his chairs, spew
	Chinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his
	teeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds.

	RUBEN yanks the papers out of the KID'S mouth, pulls the
	KID'S chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves
	the KID into place facing away from the desk, so that he
	can't do any more damage.  Then RUBEN can't figure out where
	he can work.  At the next desk, where he has been working,
	MAC rises.

				MAC
		Here... I'm finished...

				RUBEN
			(to Kid)
		I'm going to the coffee machine.
		Hold the fort.

	He moves off, the KID'S eyes move calculatingly around the
	room.  He twists against the cuffs, trying anything to get
	free, and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer.

	CLOSE UP:  The KID'S FREE HAND rifling through the drawer
	behind his back, finding the gun.  PULL BACK to show the
	KID.  He is as Ruben positioned him, his back pressed
	against the desk.

	INT. CITY JAIL CELL - DAY

	CONRAD is brought in by a Guard.  Lightly shacked.  M.J.
	stands.  Conrad sits.

				CONRAD
		Who are you?

				M.J.
		Inspector Halloran.  Homicide.
		You were supposed to contact a
		Peter Kurten?

				CONRAD
			(cagey)
		I was?  How you spell that?

				M.J.
		Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the
		length of my arm...

				CONRAD
			(interrupting)
		I never hurt nobody...

				M.J.
		Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got
		felony breaking and entering,
		burglary, felonious...

				CONRAD
			(interrupting)
		I never carried a gun!

	She slaps him hard!  He is shocked.

				M.J.
		You don't listen very good.  This
		break in -- I can call it a felony --
		three strikes, and you got about
		sixteen strikes already, and you're
		in jail for the rest of your life,
		no parole.  Or I could see it gets
		forgotten.

				CONRAD
		You get me out first.

				M.J.
		Doesn't work that way.  You had your
		chance, now fuck yourself...

	She's walking to the door... Conrad holds out just one more
	beat to see if she's bluffing... her hand is on the door
	knob...

				CONRAD
		Tell me what you want me to say.
		Anything.

				M.J.
		You were going to make a delivery
		to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee
		Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone
		number.

				CONRAD
		I don't have it...

	M.J. starts to open the door...

				CONRAD
		Wait... wait... I already called
		him, I threw it away.

				M.J.
		You already made the delivery?

				CONRAD
		No, that's still in my jacket I was
		wearing.  We were supposed to meet
		on the docks, that number 47 wharf,
		10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand
		me 500 bucks.

				M.J.
		What Friday?

				CONRAD
		What day is this?  In jail you lose
		track.  This week.  Friday.

	M.J. is already on her way...

				CONRAD
		Don't forget me, please.  I told
		you what you wanted -- don't forget
		me.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

	DESERTED.  A LONG SHADOW OF A MAN STRETCHES OUT ACROSS THE
	DOCK.  IT IS PETER, WALKING LEISURELY FROM THE WATERFRONT
	DRIVE TOWARD THE HUGE WATERHOUSE AT THE END OF THE DOCK.  HE
	STEPS INTO THE DEEP SHADOWS AND SEEMS TO VANISH.

	CLOSE:  PETER.  HE CHECKS HIS WATCH AND TURNS TO WATCH THE
	DOCK AND THE SHORE.  HE CAN SEE AND NOT BE SEEN.  HE IS 
	ENTIRELY ALONE NOW.

	INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

	RUBEN takes coffee and doughnuts out of a box, then leans
	over the KID who seems to have calmed down.  He uncuffs him
	from the chair.

				RUBEN
		Behave.  You refuse my hospitality,
		I'm putting you to bed.

	He pushes the coffee toward the Kid, who WHIPS NIKKO'S GUN
	OUT FROM UNDER THE DESK, where it was hidden, and lays it up
	under Ruben's ear.  KID moves behind RUBEN and puts a skinny
	arm around RUBEN'S neck, pulling him upright.  RUBEN still
	clutching the doughnut box.  It takes a moment for the
	others to SEE.  Then the room is absolutely motionless.

				NIKKO
		Take it easy, Kid.  Nobody's gonna
		do anything.  Just let the gun
		down, so it don't go off...

	A CHINESE DETECTIVE REPEATS THE SAME IDEA IN CHINESE...

				KID
			(screams)
		Nobody comes through the door...

	Behind the KID, as he backs through the door, across the
	corridor we LOOK STRAIGHT DOWN A CORRIDOR TO WHERE M.J. IS
	COMING ALMOST AT A RUN -- SHE SEES what is happening.

	The KID doesn't see her, yet, as he is backing away from the
	others... M.J. DRAWS HER GUN AND STANDS IN FIRING POSITION.

	IF SHE FIRES FROM HERE RUBEN IS DIRECTLY BEHIND THE KID, AND
	OTHER OFFICERS, IN THE LINE THE BULLET WOULD TAKE ARE STILL
	SCRAMBLING OUT OF HER LINE... SHE CAN'T FIRE.

				M.J.
		Hey, you...

	The KID turns, sees her, exposing his shoulder to her... SHE
	FIRES AND HITS THE KID.

	HE IS THROWN TO THE FLOOR AND TWISTED AROUND BY THE IMPACT,
	LANDING BEHIND RUBEN SO SHE CAN'T MAKE A SECOND SHOT.

	RUBEN GOES FOR HIS OWN GUN, BUT THE KID'S GUN THAT FELL FROM
	HIS HAND IS RIGHT BY HIM STILL.  THE KID GRABS IT AND FIRES
	BEFORE RUBEN HAS HIS GUN ALL THE WAY OUT OF HIS HOLSTER.  THE
	KID SHOOTS RUBEN IN THE THROAT AT AN ANGLE THAT TAKES THE
	BULLET STRAIGHT INTO HIS BRAIN.

	THEN THE KID THROWS THE GUN AWAY, AND STANDS, HIS HANDS UP
	IN SURRENDER, A GRIN ON HIS FACE.  THIS ENTIRE ACTION HAS
	TAKEN ABOUT SIX SECONDS.  THE KID GOES DOWN, FLATTENED BY
	BODIES OF THE COPS WHO HAVE RUSHED HIM.

		I'm a juvenile!  I'm a juvenile!

	M.J. RUSHES TO RUBEN.

	INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	The KID has been taken away.  PARAMEDICS are removing
	RUBEN'S body.  M.J. stands frozen as RUBEN'S stretcher is
	carried out of the room.  Her hand holds the doughnut box.

	Finally, M.J. blinks, her head turns as if she can't imagine
	what to do, where to go.  Then, suddenly conscious of the
	doughnut box, she clutches it tight against her chest.

	CLOSE:  M.J.

	She abruptly remembers: the rendezvous with Peter Kurten!

				NIKKO
		Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking

		You can't imagine how many times I

		Want to hear something weird?  I

		You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

				NIKKO
		Who gives a fuck?  In all the years
		I never seen you cry.

		You loved him.

	M.J. looks away.

				M.J.
		Who gives a fuck?

	QUINN enters to find his two senior officers in tears.  Pays
	no attention to Conrad.

				QUINN
		So I'm maybe gonna lose three good

	computer screen.

				HELEN (O.S.)
		Who's the married man?

				M.J.
		What does it matter?  This guy, you
		checked your course records, who
		signed up?

	Helen returns with the brandy.  M.J. holds it, doesn't drink,
	just stares at the computer screen, emotionally dead...

				HELEN
		The University computer is down for

		through my own notes...

				M.J.

		Look.  There's the order:  you
		wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi &
		Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's
		going to be Dahmer next.  Which
		means he'll kill a man.

	With an effort of will M.J. moves to the phone, putting the
	brandy down.

				HELEN
		Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...

				M.J.

		This is the first person close to

		Right.  Well.  He's going to do

				DETECTIVE 2
		They were combing Fertility

				M.J.
		You want to get onto the DMV, we

	Next station.  QUINN has appeared and is listening.

				M.J.
		Alert Campus Security on college

	SAKS has appeared and stands by Quinn: they both stare at
	her and she becomes more and more self conscious and aware
	of how impossible this is...

				M.J.
			(to them)
		That was Bundy.  He killed forty of

	SAKS (AND NOW WE SEE OTHER SWAT TYPES IN THE SHADOWS, HIDDEN
	FROM THE VIEW OF THE AUDITORIUM) STANDS IN THE STREET
	FLAGGING HER DOWN --

	SHE STOPS, PUTTING DOWN WINDOW.  SAKS RESTS HIS HAND ON THE
	DOOR... He shoves no sign of recognizing her...

				SAKS
		Ma'am, please get out of your
		vehicle...

				HELEN
		Merry, how... oh, Christ, of
		course, you had my phone tapped.

				SAKS
		Just get out of your vehicle...

				HELEN
		He's got Sergeant Halloran in
		there.  He'll kill her the minute
		he sees or hears your people...

				SAKS
		You've been very useful, Doctor, we
		appreciate all you've done, and now
		the professional will take over...

				HELEN
		He wants me, he doesn't care about
		her.  Let me...

	SAKS HAS THE DOOR OPEN AND IS REACHING TO PULL HER FROM THE
	DRIVER'S SEAT... HELEN SUCKS IN HER BREATH AND JAMS ON THE
	GAS.  SAKS IS ALMOST DRAGGED AWAY WITH HER, SPUN AROUND AND
	FALLING ON THE PAVEMENT.  SHE SLAMS THE DOOR AS SHE SPEEDS
	TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...

	SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN
	AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING
	HIM FROM SHOOTING.

	NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
	street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
	brakes behind M.J.'s car.

	CLOSE: HELEN.  Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.
	She gets out of the car.  As she walks even her sneakers
	make an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up
	the wide stairs...

	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The huge doors creak open and Helen enters.  She stands,
	listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall
	windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough
	without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily
	returns...

	Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.
	She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
	building cooling in the night air.  Or is the movement of
	Peter somewhere in the room?

	She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
	auditorium...

	CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE.  NOTHING.

	THEN:

	PETER IS STARING BACK.  HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE.  THE
	VISION SNAPS.

	HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO
	A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK
	CORRIDOR.  SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY.
	THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT.  AS SHE
	WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE
	SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE
	DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP.  SHE
	SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.

	REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM.  THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM
	BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN.  IN REVERSE, WE SEE
	FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM
	HER NECK.  WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP,
	BUT SHE IS PARALYZED, FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
	TERRIBLE SLOW MOTION INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING
	AT HER, HELEN'S HELPLESS HORROR, THE COP'S APPEALING LOOK TO
	HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE
	COP'S THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR.

	HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM!

	CLOSE: HELEN (PRESENT) RECOVERING.  (SHE HASN'T SCREAMED AT
	ALL.)  SHE PULLS RUBEN'S GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN
	THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.

	AS THE DOOR OPENS.  THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT,
	BLINDING IN HERE.  SHE STEPS IN.  THERE IS A SOUND THAT
	DRAWS HER ROUND, HER GUN COMING UP: BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE
	BROOM CLOSET... SHE FIRES TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CLOSET DOOR.
	IT SPRINGS OPEN AND MOPS AND PAILS FALL THUNDEROUSLY OUT
	ONTO THE TILE FLOOR.

	SHE WHIRLS TO COVER HER BACK; FACES THE STALLS.

	EXT. SAKS' ROADBLOCK - NIGHT

	THEY REACT TO ECHOES OF THE GUNFIRE.

				SWAT
		Oh, man?!  Let us in there.

				SAKS
		Go.  Go.  Go!

	Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows
	toward the Auditorium...

	INT. LADIES' ROOM

	HELEN MOVES ALONG THE STALLS PUSHING DOORS OPEN.  UNTIL SHE
	SHOVES ONE OPEN AND SEES:

	M.J. IS HANGING BY A NOOSE, DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID
	IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE.  SHE IS ALIVE, HOLDING THE NOOSE
	FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...

	HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO
	OUT.  PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER,
	REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.

				PETER
		You cheated!  You said you'd come
		die with me.

	WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE
	HANGS.  HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER
	HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR
	OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN,
	WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.

	EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	WITH EFFICIENCY AND CAUTION FBI SWAT TYPES MOVE TOWARD THE
	AUDITORIUM.  A GRAPPLING HOOK IS THROWN HIGH OVER THE ROOF;
	THEY PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT.  A HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN, BATHING
	THE SCENE IN ITS BRILLIANT LIGHT...

	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

	PETER HAS HELEN ON THE STAGE WHERE CHAIRS ARE RANDOMLY
	SCATTERED AND PUSHED HER TO A SEAT FACING HIM, ALMOST KNEE
	TO KNEE... HELEN WILL USE HER PSYCHOLOGICAL WILES TO TRY TO
	TAKE AWAY PETER'S CONTROL OF THE SITUATION... PETER LOOKS UP
	AT THE SOUND... HE IS PROUD AND THRILLED.

				PETER
		Listen to them!  We'll be on all
		three channels.

				HELEN
		Kill me, Peter, do it, now.

				PETER
		No.  Not yet.

				HELEN
		Do it.  If that's what all this
		carnage is about, then do it.  Have
		enough guts to do it.

				PETER
		Don't talk to me about courage.  I
		know death, what it's like to kill.
		You're not a killer -- you watched
		Daryll Lee kill that cop and you
		didn't make a peep, because you
		were paralyzed with fear.  You
		chocked.  I know something else about
		you.

	Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a
	pill into his mouth and swallows...

				PETER
		You want one?  No?  There was
		something in you that was
		fascinated, that wanted to see what
	it was like for a man to die.
		Everybody feels it.  Like every
		person who slows to see a bad
		accident, or runs to see a fire.
		That's true.  I see it in you...
		you're the same as me.

	THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE... LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN.

				PETER
		Oh, no.

	HE GRABS HER, AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM, WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AS
	HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE.

	FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE,
	INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND
	DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER.  GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.

	He leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair
	facing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

				PETER
		We'll keep talking.  Until they get
		here.  Then...
			(smiles)

				HELEN
		I have no life anymore.  I ruined
		your life, make me pay for it.

				PETER
		Why did you do that?  Didn't you
		have any idea how hard it was for
		me, to get that far?  I worshipped
		you.  You inspired me.  I thought
		you could understand me the way you
		understood the others.  I knew that
		about you -- the ones you admired
		were the great murderers; they
		fascinated you.

				HELEN
		That's not who I admire -- I admire
		people who are good at what they
		do, great artists, writers,
		thinkers...

				PETER
		I don't have the talent for any of
		those things.  All I have a talent
		for is death.  And I am one of a
		kind.  What do you think of your
		student now?  I have made you
		famous, I am your creation and your
		monument.

	BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A
	VANTAGE POINT: WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE FIGURE... HELEN SEES
	BUT PETER DOES NOT.

				HELEN
		If you let me, I can make you more
		famous than any of them.

				PETER
		Oh, please.  I know what's coming,
		now.  "Let me help you..."

				HELEN
		Do anything you want to me.  I give
		myself to you.  Only put the knife
		down.  Isn't this what you always
		wanted?  I know it's what we all
		want, to love and to loved.  I
		could love you.  You could work
		together in some safe place, learn
		to really understand you, help you,
		give you some peace of mind, some
		happiness...

				PETER
		Back in the driver's seat again,
		Doctor?  That old dream -- study us
		to see what makes us sick.  So you
		can find a cure -- they'd name it
		after you?  Death is the only cure
		for people like me.

	He leans toward her with the knife.  This might be the
	moment.  His gun lies on the floor beside him.

	HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT
	AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS,
	TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS.  HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING
	THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.

	HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM
	BACKWARD.  SHE STANDS... HE COMES UP WITH GUN... AND AIMS AT
	HER...

	BEHIND HIM M.J. STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS HAVING NOW A CLEAN
	SHOT.

	HELEN DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE, JUST LOOKS INTO PETER'S EYES AS
	M.J. AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER
	SHOT: SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER.

				HELEN
		Do it.  For God's sake, now...

	M.J. FIRES.

	PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT, STANDS THERE,
	SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT... HE STARES AT HER.

				PETER
			(surprised, like a
			 child)
		You hurt me!

	M.J. HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM, READY TO SHOOT AGAIN, BUT HE JUST
	GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING... AS:

	THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS
	EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.

	THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED
	SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION
	GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND
	SHADOWS.

	OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...

				M.J. & HELEN
		No!!

	PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN
	SCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...

	A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT
	TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.

	SWAT TEAM

	LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.

	PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND
	SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

	M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE
	BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.

				M.J.
		Jesus that hurts.  You think the
		rib is busted?

				PARAMEDIC
		That looks like just a bad bruise.
		I'll tape it up if you want to...

				M.J.
		I'll take some Tylenol and codeine,
		instead, how about a lot of number
		six?

	The medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around
	them.  Helen sits down next to M.J.  M.J. begins to put on
	her shirt, wincing at the movement.  Helen helps her.

				M.J.
			(it hurts)
		Oh, God.

	SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND
	LIGHT AND SHADOW.  When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun
	and hands it to him.  It is what he expects, but she
	misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her
	resignation from the cops.  He takes it only as a part of
	officer related shooting routine.  SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE
	AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.

				QUINN
		I'll take it, kid.  You take two
		weeks paid leave.  Don't waste a
		second thinking about that shitbag.
		Then come back.  You're a cop, M.J.

	He nods to Helen...

				QUINN (cont'd)
		Get the civilians outta here.

				M.J.
		She's in no shape to give her
		statement tonight...

				QUINN
		No, she can come in tomorrow...
		gonna want to know a lot of
		things...

	B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING
	HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage
	and lifted him onto a gurney.  The body is wheeled past
	them, as...

				HELEN
		The only one who could tell you
		what you really need to know is
		dead.

				QUINN
		Yeah, it's a thought...

	Of no importance to him, he turns away...

	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big
	exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion
	grenades).  Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus
	under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault.  M.J. and
	HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...

	THE AUDITORIUM (POV).

	The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a
	small door -- easy escape.  They run toward it...

	EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	It is dark where they step out into the night.  Around the
	corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA
	CIRCUS.  THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.
	M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.
	SHE CATCHES UP TO HER.  HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK
	AWAY...

				M.J.
		You could use a long hot bath, you
		know that?  You better get somebody
		to drive you home.

				HELEN
		Why can't I drive home?  I will.
		You.  Look at you.  You need a ride
		home.  And you don't even know it.

				M.J.
			(beat)
		Well, thanks.

	The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside
	the circle of media.  CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL
	SHOT.

	THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.

				SUSAN
		Hey!  Halloran!  What's the story
		here?

	On the two women getting in the car...

				HELEN
		If she has to ask, she's never
		gonna know.

	HIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE
	NIGHT.

				THE END
CUBE
 

 
  


 

 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------- At first we see an eye. Closed and slowly it opens up and looks around. Later we get a full view of a man lying on the floor in a strange-looking room. 4 walls, 1 ceiling, 1 floor. 6 sides just like a cube. There is a kind of door on each side. Each door has a handle. On the walls are weird-looking pictures. They doesn't seem to look like anything seen before. The man stands up in the middle of the room. The camera pans around him. Then he makes some sounds and opens a door in one of the walls. As he looks in to the open door, he sees a new room like the one he is located in, but the light in the new room is blue. He turns around and the door closes by itself. Then he opens the door in in the floor. Under that door, there's a new room excatly like the first, but in this room the light is red. The door closes. He opens a new door in one of the walls. The light in there is red. He looks back and then crawls into the new room. As he lands on the floor in the new room it makes a loud sound, and then the door closes behind him. He takes one step, and then there is a loud sound. The man stands still. Slowly he begins to bleed, and slowly his body begins to fall apart. As the last parts of his body hits the floor, we see a sort of trelliswork. First it moves to the floor, and afterwards it is being folded up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- TITLE AND INTRO -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- A man lies on the floor. A door is open beside him. Slowly we see a hand trying to find something to hold on to. A man crawls up from the hole. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Hey... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin closes the door in the floor. He sits down beside the man lying on the floor and tries to wake him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Hey... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin stands up and opens a door in one of the walls. He looks into a new room. Red light. He closes the door again. The man from before is now awake. We hear a sound from one of the other doors in the walls. Quentin stands beside the door preparing to attack whatever that comes out from there. As someone looks out, Quentin grabs her by the neck, throws her to the floor and tries to beat her, until he realises that it is a lady. The lady screams, and sits down in a corner of the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN I'm sorry... It's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you. HOLLOWAY What do you want? QUENTIN I thought you were... HOLLOWAY What? QUENTIN I don't know... -------------------------------------------------------------------- We hear a loud sound and everybody in the room looks around. As the sound stops, someone screams for help. Quentin opens a door real fast. As the camera switches to a new angle, we see a girl in a red room screaming for help. When she sees Quentin she walks towards him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN STOP! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls into the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN What, what? QUENTIN It's ok, come here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin helps Leaven into the room where the others are located. Holloway helps Leaven out, but not good enough, because Leaven falls and drops her glasses. Leaven sits up against a wall and Quentin comes towards her. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN It's ok, calm down, evrything's gonna be fine. HOLLOWAY What was in there? QUENTIN Just give me a minute to figure things out. HOOLOWAY Why are you afraid of that room? QUENTIN Just give me a minute I said. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door in the ceiling is being opened. We see an old man. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN How many people are in this thing? Listen! We can't go climbing around in here. HOLLOWAY Why not? QUENTIN There's traps. HOLLOWAY What do you mean, traps? QUENTIN Ubitraps. I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my head off! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man crawls down to the others, while Quentin talks about the traps. Leaven breathes heavily. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Holy God, holy, holy God! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man sits down and begins to untie his shoe. Leaven suddenly hugs Quentin. Holloway sits down beneath Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Are you alright? Mister? Worth? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway gets the attention from Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Alright? WORTH I hit my head? HOLLOWAY Let me take a look at that. It's ok, I'm a doctor, it doesn't look bad. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What the hell are you doing? -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man opens a door and now looks into a blue room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Hey old man? -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man, Rennes, throws his boot into the room. An incinerator quickly burns the boot. Rennes pulls the boot back and then the door closes. Rennes drops the boot on the floor. -------------------------------------------------------------------- RENNES Motiondetectors integrated in the walls. Tough to spot. LEAVEN Oh God, oh God, oh God. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes is on his way to open a new door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Wait a second! Let's all just relax for a minute. Does anybody remember how they got here? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Long, nervebreaking silence. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Perogies! I was eating dinner. Perogies, cheese and potato. I ran out of sour cream and then I went to the fridge and then I... I don't know... QUENTIN You... Leaven? LEAVEN I... I just went to bed and then QUENTIN What about you? WORTH I just woke up here. HOLLOWAY Middle of the night. It's like Chile. They always come in the middle of the night. LEAVEN Who? HOLLOWAY Only the government can build something this ugly. QUENTIN Oh, it ain't government. HOLLOWAY Then what is it. QUENTIN I don't know. HOLLOWAY Aliens! QUENTIN Please, we're spooked anough as it is. Let's rule out aliens from now on and concentrate on what we know. LEAVEN My mom's gonna freak... QUENTIN Rennes... LEAVEN Just won't be there... QUENTIN What do you think Rennes? RENNES We don't solve the act, sitting still. I'm moving at this straight line, till I get to the end. QUENTIN Alright, I attend to agree. LEAVEN Shouldn't we wait here? To see if anybody comes. WORTH No one is gonna come. QUENTIN There's a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out. We can avoid the traps using the boot. Holloway is it. What do you think? For an exit? HOLLOWAY Ok. QUENTIN It can't be that simple. RENNES It ain't gonna be that simple. Take a look around. Take a good long look around, see it. Coz, I got a feeling it's looking at us. LEAVEN I just wanna wake up... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven blinks with her eyes several times. Quentin sits down beneath her. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Leaven, we can do this. We just have to stay calm, and work together as a team. There's gotta be a lot of people looking for us on the outside. I'm a cop, alright? LEAVEN You're a cop? QUENTIN Yeah... I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise, but you gotta be with me on this one... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven nods. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Ok. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes opens a new door, waiting for Quentin to give "signal" -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Boot it! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes throws the boot, nothing happens. -------------------------------------------------------------------- RENNES Clean. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Through several times of boot-throwing we see other rooms, with other colors on the walls. On the way to a new green room, Leaven notice some numbers in the passage between two rooms. A loud sound is to hear. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY That one sounded closer. RENNES It's mechanical. Seems to come at regular intervals. QUENTIN Maybe it's the ventilationsystem? RENNES No bets... HOLLOWAY No kidding, I'm boiling -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks at the numbers again: 566 472 737. Above these numbers are some others: 476 804 539. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What is it, serial numbers? HOLLOWAY Room numbers, they're different in each room. WORTH Oh great, so there's only 566 million 400.000 rooms in this thing. HOLLOWAY There'd better not be! We have about three days without food and water before we're too weak to move. LEAVEN They have to feed us, don't they? QUENTIN Holloway! HOLLOWAY Oh, we have heat, stress, physical exhaustion i.e. dehydration, headaches, dizziness, disorientation, confusement. Mental process. The body eventual begins to break down it's own tissue. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes rips a button of Holloway's shirt. -------------------------------------------------------------------- RENNES Suck on it... Keeps the saliva flowing. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Again the boot lands in a new room. This time, it's red. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What? RENNES The air seems dry in there. HOLLOWAY Trapped? RENNES Molecular chemical sensor. QUENTIN Why the hell didn't the boot set it off. RENNES The boot's not alive. It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from the skin. QUENTIN How come, you know so much about sensors, Renz? RENNES Rennes... Not Renz! It's french! QUENTIN Fine, you're french. I'm asking how... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes opens a new door and throws the boot. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Rennes... Sensorexpert... With the right age... I don't believe it... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin laughs. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN This guy is The Wren... HOLLOWAY The what? QUENTIN The Wren. The bird of Attica. through the coop on six major prisons. RENNES Seven! HOLLOWAY You're kidding right? LEAVEN You can get us out? RENNES Maybe. HOLLOWAY An escapeartist! RENNES Yes, I'm Harry "fucking" Houdini. The only reason I dragged you so far, is cause I need your boots. If you're not smarting up I'm gone like that. No more talking... No more guessing. Don't even think about something which is not right in front of ya. That's the real challenge, you gotta save yourselves from yourselves. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes jumps into the new room. We hear a click. -------------------------------------------------------------------- RENNES Merde. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes gets acid in the face. He screams, and the door closes. In the other room, the door begins to open. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Get him out! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes' head is partly dissolved. He screams quietly, because he has blood in his mouth. The others scream too. They lay him in a corner. After a little while they look to him again. He's dead, most of his head his been dissolved. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN So it was electrochemical or whatever, right? And he missed it. The Wren... That's great, that's fucking great. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns the corpse of Rennes around with a foot. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Alright... It's time to reassess this place. HOLLOWAY I've been over it again and again, why would they throw innocent people in here? Are we being punished? LEAVEN I've never done anything to deserve this! QUENTIN Forget about all that! You can't see the big picture from in here. So don't try. Keep your head down. Keep it simple. Just look, look at what's in front of you. WORTH That's what he said. QUENTIN Start with us. We got an escapeartist and a cop. There's gotta be a reason for that. You're a doctor Holloway. That gives you a function, a reason, right? HOLLOWAY No, it just makes me go: "Why me, and not one of the ten million other doctors out there"! QUENTIN Leaven. What are you? LEAVEN Nothing, I jst go to school, hang out with my friends. QUENTIN What else? LEAVEN There is nothing else. My parents are these people I live with them... I'm boring. HOLLOWAY I think we have to ask the big questions: What does it want? What is it thinking? WORTH One down, four to go. QUENTIN Why don't you tell us what your purpose is Worth! WORTH I've wondered that myself. I'm just a guy, I work in an officebuilding, doing officebulding stuff. I wasn't actually bursting joie de vivre before I got here. Life just sucks in general. HOLLOWAY I can't stand that attitude. LEAVEN Because, he's right. QUENTIN What´s your purpose Quentin? QUENTIN Kids.. Three of them... I haven't made my piece yet. I'm getting out of here no matter what. That's where my strength comes from. You people find yours wherever you got it. For Christ's sake. What do you live for? Don't you have a wife or a girlfriend or something? WORTH Nope, I got a pretty nice collection of pornography HOLLOWAY Nice, nice. I ain't got anyone either, but I'm not giving up. I'm pissed off. The came into our homes. They stripped us bare. They took my rings. They took my... my amethyst. I wanna know who's responsible. QUENTIN Leaven, your glasses? You don't need them? LEAVEN Only for reading. QUENTIN Well, they took off her jewelry, but they must have put these on you. If nothing is random... why are they here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens a door in the wall. We see three numbers: 582 434 865. On the other side there's the numbers: 149 413 568. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Leaven, what do you read in school? Math? HOLLOWAY What can they mean? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven takes the glasses and begins to study the numbers. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN 149? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a new door. The numbers we see are: 645 372 xxx -649 -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Primenumbers. I can't believe I didn't see it before. QUENTIN See what? LEAVEN It seems like if any of these numbers of prime, then the room is trapped. Ok, 645... 645, that's not prime. 372... no. 649... Wait, 11 x 59, it's not prime either. So that room is safe. QUENTIN Wait, wait, wait. How can you make that decision based on one primenumbertrap? LEAVEN I'm not. The incinerator thing was prime: 083. The molecularchemical thing had 137, the acidroom had 149. HOLLOWAY You'd remembered all that in your head? LEAVEN I have a facility for it. QUENTIN Leaven, you beautiful brain... Boot it. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway throws the boot. Nothing happens. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Ok, out of the way. LEAVEN Brains before beauty. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven jumps into the room............... Nothing happens...... -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN SAFE! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera pans around for some time. First we see the numbers: 656 778 462, then we see Leaven thinking. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN How long have we been in here QUENTIN Nine or ten hours. -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see a door closing. Then we see Leaven rubbing her eyes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY How do you know? QUENTIN 5 'o clock stubble. the last thing I remember was shaving. LEAVEN I guess I missed breakfeast... or lunch... or whatever QUENTIN Now don't worry. I'll be home in time for dinner. LEAVEN If we get out, I'l make you dinner. QUENTIN You got a date. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens a door and Leaven looks at the numbers inside. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Doing good. HOLLOWAY I need to smoke! I could smoke a butt of a sidewalk. QUENTIN Holloway... Just real yourself in a bit. Come on. Were moving along, things are looking up. HOLLOWAY Ok. You're right, I quitted smoking years ago. I just need to be occupied. QUENTIN Talk to me. Have a conversation. What kind of doctor are you anyway? HOLLOWAY Uh, you know, the free kinda... Er, come on help me. Tell me about your rugrats. QUENTIN Ok. We have three boys. Nine, seven and five. HOLLOWAY Oh, good God. Poor woman. There's no way I'd survived that. QUENTIN She didn't either................. She's not dead, we're just separated. HOLLOWAY I'm sorry, I can't just shoot the breeze. LEAVEN These numbers aren't prime. QUENTIN Ok. Clear. HOLLOWAY Excuse me, sorry. QUENTIN You could try and help me out here buddy. WORTH No, I couldn't -------------------------------------------------------------------- The group crawls into the new room. Shortly afterwards they are in a green room, with everyone looking down in a new room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN This one is trapped too. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin closes the door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY We have to backtrack? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin looks up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Not yet. LEAVEN Oh, no. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Everyone looks up on the door. the Quentin looks at Leaven. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Read them to me. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin takes of his shirt. Leaven is ready to hold it. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY What are you? His coatrack? Oh please. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin begins to crawls up to the door. As he wants to open the door, he says: -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN It's stuck! -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin opens the door, a guy falls down and almost hits Leaven. Quentin jumps down and the new guy stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN This room is green. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan begins to knock his head into the wall. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Holloway. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway now looks at Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Hi there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway puts a hand on Kazan's forehead. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN This room is green. HOLLOWAY Yes it is. KAZAN I wanna go back to the blue room. QUENTIN Is it shock or what? HOLLOWAY I think he's mentally handicapped. KAZAN I like the blue room. QUENTIN Jesus Christ! LEAVEN He almost broke my neck. HOLLOWAY Hey there, are you all alone? Do you wanna hold my hand, honey? KAZAN Butter first, then honey, Kazan. Butter first then honey. LEAVEN How did he survive? KAZAN I wanna go back to the blue room. HOLLOWAY There's lots of blue rooms. We'll find another one to you real soon. LEAVEN This is just way too bizarre. HOLLOWAY Will you just worry about your own numbers... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks molested. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Go on, I'll look after him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven points at the ceiling. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Safe, obviously. Since he almost fell on my head. HOLLOWAY Shall we go for a walk? Kazan, do you wanna go for a walk? -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin begins to crawl up to the door. Kazan gets terrified. He hits himself with the one hand on his head. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Erm' Quentin. Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away. QUENTIN Holloway! KAZAN Holloway. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The screen fades and next time we see something is in a new room where Kazan opens a new door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico? QUENTIN What are you talking about Holloway? HOLLOWAY I'm talking about: "Where do you hide something this big?" It has at least got to fill something. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway stands walks over to Quentin and stands beside him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY I'm sorry to shake your foundations Quentin, but you have no idea where your tax-dollars go. QUENTIN Free clinic doctors? HOLLOWAY Only the military industrial complex can afford to build something this size. QUENTIN Holloway, what's the military industrial complex? Have you ever been there? I'm tellin' you, it's not that complex. HOLLOWAY And how would you know from where you are. QUENTIN What do you think these establishments is? It's just guys like me. Their desks are bigger, but their jobs aren't. They don't conspide, they... buy boats. No, this place is... Remember Scaramanga? The bad guy in "The Man With The Golden Gun". It's some rich psyco's entertainment. HOLLOWAY Is that what you think? LEAVEN Clear! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls into the passage. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Ok, you're a cop. Single bullet theory. Right on. -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Holloway lands in the new room, she starts to lose her breath. It seems like she's being choken. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Gas! QUENTIN Holloway! Get back here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- But Holloway stays where she is. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY It's ok. I just swallowed my button. LEAVEN I hate this! I hate this! QUENTIN Your boy's having a conniption sitting there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- A door is being opened. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN It's like crème without coffee. WORTH She needs a break. QUENTIN She can do it. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls into Kazan and makes him touch her hair. And then back to the other room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH They don't look prime to me. QUENTIN Is that your two bits worth, Worth? WORTH Of course it's what is worth. QUENTIN Well? LEAVEN Well, he's right. Not prime. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin jumps into the new room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN STOP! In front of you!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- A lot of wires or whatever is being shot down from the ceiling and the slowly surrounds Quentin, rotates and Quentin just jumps away before he gets split up into several pieces. But it wasn't without pain. Quentin gets cut on one of his legs. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY What is it? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin gets back into the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN SHUT UP!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door closes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN I don't know what happened. it wasn't prime. HOLLOWAY Quentin, hold still! QUENTIN Somebody stop that rackets! HOLLOWAY Worth. QUENTIN Leave the boots. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth joins Kazan to make him shut up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN And shut the fucking door! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door closes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN I had a feeling about that fucking guy. He knew about that trap. LEAVEN But these numbers aren't prime. QUENTIN Then your numbersystem failed, but he knew. HOLLOWAY Knew what? How could he know? QUENTIN You're the paranoid, think about it. His only function so far is to kick us when we're down. HOLLOWAY So, he has a bad attitude. So you think that makes him spy. QUENTIN Trust me on this, it's my job to read people like an x-ray. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door opens and Worth comes in with Kazan. Worth holds him for his eyes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH He doesn't like red rooms. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth makes Kazan, sit by himself. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH So what happened? QUENTIN Pmfh, you saw what happened! HOLLOWAY Quentin! LEAVEN I guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought. WORTH Maybe they mean nothing at all. LEAVEN No, it means they're more involved, the works for us up to now have just been bad, I just need more time with them. HOLLOWAY We need to rest anyway. QUENTIN Well that's handy, like if there was nothing fucking else we could do. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades. Next time we see Leaven writing some numbers on a piece of metal. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Are they telling you anything? LEAVEN They're not Tarot-cards. Do you have any idea on how many variables I have to consider before I can decide from numbers this size!?!? They don't reveal themselves right away! QUENTIN They're like people. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan pulls down his pants to pee. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Oh, gross. HOLLOWAY Erm, not here honey, over in the corner. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Everybody looks at him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Well, he's just peeing! QUENTIN Jesus Christ! LEAVEN Excellent! Now it totally reeks in here! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth laughs. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN And you find this all pretty funny, don't you? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin goes really close to Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What's your fucking problem Worth? Even Holloway's holding up better than you. Get over there and help her with him. That's your job, babysitter! WORTH Jawohl, Kommandant! QUENTIN Somebody has to taka responsibility around here. WORTH And that somebody has to be you. QUENTIN Not all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists. WORTH Not all of us are conceded enough to play hero. QUENTIN It's the will to live, everybody's got it Worth, even you, especially you hiding behind that cynical front. WORTH The will to live. That's the warm, coasy feeling deep inside. Thanks partner, I'm a new man. QUENTIN Arh, poor Worth: "Nobody loves me". If that's the chip on your shoulders, then why did you lug it all this way? Why didn't you just lie down and die! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens the door to the trap from before. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Do it. Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine. Be a man. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Everybody's waiting for Worth to answer. Finally Worth stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Thought so. WORTH Fuck you Quentin. I don't wanna die, I'm just being realistic. Do you think they just builded this thing so we could just walk out of it? QUENTIN Do you think they would lay clues, if there wasn't a way out. WORTH You think we matter, we don't QUENTIN Put us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here. WORTH Oh, you're not getting out. QUENTIN Yes, we are! WORTH There is no way outta here!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Long and nervebreaking silence. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Got ya. HOLLOWAY How... Do you know? QUENTIN Answer the question Worth. HOLLOWAY Oh, God! QUENTIN Who are you? WORTH I am the poison. I designed the outer shell. HOLLOWAY What? WORTH The shell, the sarcophagus. LEAVEN You builded this thing? WORTH Not this part, the exterior. I don't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here. I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell. A cube. LEAVEN A cube! Why didn't you tell us? HOLLOWAY For Gods sake, Worth. You knew what it was. WORTH No QUENTIN Worth! You're lying. WORTH Not first. HOLLOWAY Who's beyond it? WORTH I don't know. QUENTIN Who hired you? WORTH I didn't ask. I never even left my office. I talked on the phone to some other guys like me. Specialists working on small details. Nobody knew what it was. Nobody cared. QUENTIN Bullshit! You knew from square one. Look at him, he's up to his eyeballs in this thing. HOLLOWAY No Quentin. That's how they stay hidden. You keep everyone separated so the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. The brain never comes out in the open. QUENTIN Whose brain? HOLLOWAY It's all the same machine right. Pentagon. Multinational coorporations. The police! If you do one little job. You build a widget in Saskatoon. The next thing you know, it's two miles under the desert, the essential component of a deathmachine. I was right! All along my whole life I knew it. I told you Quentin. Nobody's ever call me paranoid again. We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing. WORTH Holloway, you don't get it. HOLLOWAY Then tell me, please, I need to know. WORTH It's maybe hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy. Nobody is in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a masterplan. Can you grasp that? Big brother is not watching you. QUENTIN What kind of fucking explanation is that? WORTH It's the best you´re gonna get. I looked and the only explanation I can come to is that there is nobody up there. QUENTIN Somebody had to say yes to this thing. WORTH What thing? Only we know what it is. QUENTIN We have no idea, what it is. WORTH We know more than anybody else. I mean somebody might have known sometime, before they got fired or voted out or sold it. But if this place ever had a purpose, then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle. This is an accident, a forgotten propetual, public, worksproject. Do you think anybody wants to ask questions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck. I mean, I lead on my desk for months. This was a great job! QUENTIN Why put people in it? WORTH Because it's here. you have to use it or admit it's pointless. QUENTIN But it is pointless! WORTH Quentin... That's my point. HOLLOWAY What have we come to? It's so much worse than I thought. WORTH Not really, just more pathetic. QUENTIN You make me sick, Worth! WORTH I make me sick too. We´re both part of the system. I drew a box - you walk a beat. It's like you said Quentin is: Keep your head down, keep it simple, just look at what's in fron of you! I mean nobody wants to see the big picture. Life's too complicated. I mean, let's face it. The reason we're here is it's out of control. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Is that how we're ruining the world? LEAVEN Daah! Have you been on glue all of your life. I felt guilty for ruining the world since I was like... seven. God! If you need someone to blame, throw a rock. WORTH Now I feel better. HOLLOWAY That's why you stayed with us. To confess. WORTH Still looking for someone to bust, Quentin? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around again and begins to beat Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Quentin, Quentin, STOP IT! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven grabs Quentin's arm. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN We need him. QUENTIN What for? HOLLOWAY Have you gone absolutely mad? He's the only one who knows nything about the place. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth falls to the ground. Quentin walks away. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Worth... WORTH Hi... LEAVEN So there's this outer shell. WORTH Yeah. LEAVEN And it's a cube, like this? WORTH I assume so. LEAVEN Are there any doors? WORTH There's one door. LEAVEN Where? WORTH Wherever the doorguy put it. Six guesses and it's sealed from the outside. LEAVEN What are the dimensions of the outer shell? WORTH 434 feetsquare. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven starts to take steps inside the room until she gets to Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN May I? HOLLOWAY Come on. Side over. LEAVEN 14 by 14 by 14. WORTH The inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell. There is a space. LEAVEN One cube? WORTH I don't know. It makes sense. LEAVEN Well, the biggest the cube then can be is... 26 rooms heigh, 26 rooms across, so... 17.576 rooms. HOLLOWAY 17.576 rooms? Oh, God that makes me queasy. LEAVEN Descartes... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a new door and puts on her glasses. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Leaven, you are a genius! QUENTIN What? -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see three numbers: 517 478 565 -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Cartesian co-ordinates, of course, coded Cartesian co-ordinates. They are uses in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph. QUENTIN In English. Slower. LEAVEN Bonjour, these numbers are markers, a grid-referance, like altitude and longitude on a map. The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube. QUENTIN Then where are we? LEAVEN It works! Ok, all I have to do now is add the numbers together. The X co-ordinate is 19, Y is 26 rooms. So that places us... seven rooms from the edge. QUENTIN Alright, let's go. WORTH Just out of curuiosity. I mean don't hit me again or anything. But what are you gonna do when you get there? QUENTIN Maybe we can get the door open. WORTH Wrong. HOLLOWAY What we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps. QUENTIN I'm dealing with that Holloway. I'm looking for practical solutions here. HOLLOWAY Well, you haven't found any yet! QUENTIN We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first. HOLLOWAY No he won't Quentin, we take turns! QUENTIN Relax. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades. The first we see is someone nervous playing with his/hers button. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Is there room for two in there? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls in to Leaven. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QIENTIN What's the matter? LEAVEN These co-ordinates: 14, 27, 14. QUENTIN What about them? LEAVEN Well, they don't make sense. Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across, there can't be a co-ordinate larger than 26. If that was right, then we would be outside the cube. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks up, and looks around. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN No, not outside the cube. QUENTIN I guess that means we're not having dinner. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades. First we see the group opening the door in the floor. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Trap, trap, trap. TRAP! -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see a blue room. Just after Kazan says trap the last time. A lot of spears come out from the walls until the room is filled with spears. In the end the spears go back again. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN TRAP! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The spears come again, and goes away in the end. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN (Whispers) It's soundactivated. BOOOH! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The spears come, and goes away. They close the door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Lovely. LEAVEN How come the sound of the door-opening didn't set it off? QUENTIN Must be reat to ignore it. HOLLOWAY So that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps. LEAVEN Well, I guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else. QUENTIN Who knows how many detours we'll have to take. I say we cross the bitch. HOLLOWAY Right. QUENTIN How many boots do we have left Holloway? -------------------------------------------------------------------- They look at Kazan's feet. Just one boot left. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Get it off him. We know how it works, we just have to be quiet. WORTH Pretty fucking quiet. QUENTIN I'm glad you're on sight Worth, because you're up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan makes a sound. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN And he's not coming. HOLLOWAY Of course he is. QUENTIN No way! HOLLOWAY You're not leaving him behind. QUENTIN He's unpredictable. When we get to the edge we can come back for him, but he will get somebody killed here. Am I right? HOLLOWAY Shame on you. Will you look at yourselves. What have you turned into? They may have taken our lives away, but we're still human beings. That's all we've got left. LEAVEN We'll come back for him. HOLLOWAY That's a lie and you know it. WORTH He'll be quiet. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens the door and puts Worth down there. He hangs in the ceiling by himself now with a boot in his mouth. He crawls down the wall. Meanwhile we hear something nearby. As it's no longer is to hear. Worth opens a door, nothing happens, and crawls in. Leaven is up next. Afterwards Holloway. Next is Kazan. As Leaven is in Worth and Holloway stands on the floor. Kazan crawls in the ceiling and afterwards he crawls the wrong way. Holloway goes to get him. Suddenly his pants are stuck in the handle on the floor. Holloway tries to unloose it. Next up is Quentin. Now all is in except Quentin. He is on his way. In the floor the door is opening. So Quentin hurries up and aren't safe as the handle stops turning. He waits to be speared. Nothing happens. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Hah! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Now the spears come again, Quentin just makes it into the passage. Now we are in a red room. Quentin grabs Kazan and almost beats him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN You fucking fuck! HOLLOWAY That's enough! QUENTIN He's a trap! HOLLOWAY Let him go right now! QUENTIN Law of the jungle Holloway. He's a danger in the pack! HOLLOWAY Let him go you nazi! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin lets go of Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What did you call me? HOLLOWAY Quentin! You let that innocent boy go. QUENTIN You listen to me woman. Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart. The only reason why you exist is because I keep you! I know your type. No kids, no man to fuck you. So you go around outraged sticking your nose up in other peoples assholes, sniffing their business! You missed your boat Holloway. You are all dry up inside there aren't you? That's your fucking problem. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The others look shocked. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN How dare you say that to her? You don't know her Quentin. None ouf us know eachother here. QUENTIN Oh, I do. LEAVEN No you don't! HOLLOWAY No wonder your wife left you. All that bottled-up anger. And a thing for young girls. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin slaps Holloway in the face. He looks insulted. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY God help you Quentin. Did you smack your kids around too? LEAVEN Is anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that door? QUENTIN Open it. WORTH Door number six, not door number one, door number two. QUENTIN Open the fucking thing. HOLLOWAY ("singing") Sunshine. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens the door. Now we see something completely black. Only with a little light from rooms below and on the other sides. It's the edge, the shell. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Nighttime. WORTH My old friend the shell. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth crawls into the passage. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH It's there. Morning! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we hear a gigantic echo. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Hang on to me. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls in and Worth crawls into the room again. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Can't see shit. Nothing to hang on to. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls back. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN We have to try something. We gotta see if the door's over there. Someone has to swing over there and take a look. We make a rope of our clothes. Take it off. I'll tie it onto myself. LEAVEN Yeah, you're gonna go. You weigh like 500 pounds it'll snap in two seconds. I'm the lightest. QUENTIN Forget it. HOLLOWAY I'll go. QUENTIN I'm going Holloway. HOLLOWAY She's right Quentin, you're too heavy. I'm the lightest after Leaven. Anyways it's my turn. -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin ties the clothes, Holloway and Worth talks together. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY How long did you know people we're put in here. WORTH A couple of months. HOLLOWAY That's not long , if you consider your whole life. WORTH I am. HOLLOWAY You opened my eyes Worth, that´s something. WORTH David. HOLLOWAY Helen. WORTH And such a Helen. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway begins to crawl outside the room. She's almost crying. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN That's as far as you go. HOLLOWAY There's nothing down here. Hold tight. I'll try swinging over there. Place yourself I'm gonna try again. Ok, one more time. WORTH Hurry, you're getting heavy. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Third time Holloway tries to swing over to the shell there's a big crash. The others now drops the grip of the rope. Quentin just reaches the end of the rope, as Holloway is falling. The others graps Quentins feet as he is almost out fo the room too. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY What the hell is going on? QUENTIN Get up here now! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls up. In the end Quentin can reach her arm. First Quentin smiles, Holloway smiles too. But then Quentin looks someway different. Holloway knows what is going to happen. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Quentin... LEAVEN Do you got her? WORTH What's going on? LEAVEN Is she Ok? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin drops Holloway and crawls back into the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN She... slipped. KAZAN Holloway. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven sits down i a corner. Quentin walks over to her. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Sssh! Come on Kazan. Kazan will you please stop doing that! QUENTIN Leaven, you gotta be strong sweetheart. LEAVEN Don't even talk to me. QUENTIN We gotta get down to the bottom. It'll be easier to get on to shell from there. It's a long fucking way with only one boot. But we gotta do it, before we get too weak. You gotta keep cracking the numbers Leaven. LEAVEN I can't think anymore. QUENTIN Sure you can. It's your gift. LEAVEN It's not a gift, it's just a brain. WORTH Let her sleep for a while. We haven't slept for fucking hours. QUENTIN Ok, one hour. WORTH How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is? QUENTIN An hour is as long as I say. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The group go to sleep. In the background weird music is to hear. After a little while, we see someone taking the boot away from Worth. Then we see a hand holding Leaven for the mouth. Then Quentin is bending towards Leaven and afterwards we see him carry Leaven. The next we see is a door closing. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN What are you doing? QUENTIN We have to make it down to the bottom. There'll be quiet there and you can concentrate. LEAVEN Do you just wanna leave them? QUENTIN They're traps! We are the key. I get us down there. You think us out. Believe in me. Try to see what I see, how my mind works. THRASH! When I look into someone's head like a fucking x-ray. I looked through the walls. I dreamed him at his desk, designing everything. He can't let you solve the puzzle. There is a purpose. We are the purpose. The cube is us. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin begins to touch Leaven. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Quentin... QUENTIN We fit like numbers. A man and a woman. Two halves of the equation. I take you down. The perfect key. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin goes further and tries to touch her breasts. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN I'll slip you on the lock. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven runs away. Quentin stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Leaven... It's time to go down. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin tries to catch her. Meanwhile a door is being opened. Worth comes jumping hitting Quentin to the floor. Kazan enters the room too. The door closes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Get away from her. Leaven, they're fucking spy's. Him, the retard. Holloway had outside information about my family. She went too far. LEAVEN You dropped her. WORTH Just go Quentin LEAVEN Give us the boot, you pig! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around and suddenly hits Worth with the boot. Then he walks towards Leaven. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN You don't want the boot. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Then Quentin again hits Worth several times. Afterwards he opens the door in the floor. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN You wanna come with us Worth? Down the hatch. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin throws Worth down the hole in the floor. As Worth hits the floor, he starts laughing. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What the fuck's with him? -------------------------------------------------------------------- The others crawl down to Worth. He lies on the door, on the handle. As the camera switches angle, we see a corpse with the face down. Quentin turns the corpse with his foot. It's Rennes. Quentin drops the boot. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN How does he...? WORTH (laughing) It's The Wren, the old Renster. QUENTIN How could...? WORTH (laughing) We've been going in circles QUENTIN That can't be. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin grabs Leaven and opens a door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Where are we? LEAVEN I don't know. QUENTIN Where are we??? LEAVEN You figure it out! You haven't done anything. All you do is freak out! YOU MURDERER! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven starts crying. Worth stands up and laughs. Quentin sits down. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN You were right Worth. There is no outta here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin starts crying. Kazan comes and touches his hair. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN (crying) Get away from me. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Wasn't Rennes killed in that room? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens the door to were Rennes was killed. There's nothing. All we see is black. It's the edge, the shell. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH How come there's nothing out there. QUENTIN You see an edge. WORTH We were not at the edge before. Where's the room that killed Rennes? QUENTIN Fuck off! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin throws the boot after Worth, but the boot does not him it's being thrown out of the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Oh, that was good. QUENTIN What difference does it make? We're dead anyways. WORTH HEY! Listen to what I'm saying! There was a room there before! We haven't been moving in circles, the rooms have! LEAVEN Of course. QUENTIN The rooms? WORTH That explains the thunder, the shaking. We've been shifting the whole time. LEAVEN It's the only logical explanation. I'm such an idiot. WORTH What are you on to Leaven. LEAVEN Give me a minute. The numbers are markers point on a map, right? WORTH Right. LEAVEN And how do you map a point that keeps moving? WORTH Permutations. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven nods. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Permu... what? LEAVEN Permutations. A list of all the co-ordinates the room passes through. Like a map that that tells you where the room starts, how many times it moves and where it moves to. QUENTIN The numbers tell you all that? LEAVEN I don't know. I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is probably the startingposition. All I saw, was how the cube looked like before it started to move. QUENTIN Ok, so it's moving. How do we get out? LEAVEN 27. I know where the exit is. QUENTIN Where? LEAVEN Stay away from me. WORTH Back off, Quentin! QUENTIN I just wanna know, don't you wanna know? LEAVEN You remember that room we passed through before, the one with the co-ordinate larger than 26? WORTH What about it? LEAVEN That co-ordinate placed the room outside the cube. WORTH A bridge? LEAVEN Right, but only in it's original position. QUENTIN What are you talking about? LEAVEN Look, the room starts off as a bridge, then it moves it's way through the maze, which is where we ran into it, but at some point it must return to it's original position. WORTH So the bridge is just a bridge... LEAVEN ... in a short period of time. This thing is like a giant combinationlock, when the rooms are in their startingposition ht elock is open. But when they move out of the linement the lock closes. WORTH Well the size of us... It must take days to complete a full cycle. QUENTIN So when does it open? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we see Leaven doing some math again. Quentin crawls towards her. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Don't! We find it's original co-ordinates by adding the numbers, the permutations is found by subtracting the numbers. It's it. The room moves to 0, 1 and -1 on the x-axis, 2, 5 and -7 on y, and 1, -1 and 0 on z. QUENTIN And what does that mean. LEAVEN You suck in math? Ok, I need the roomnumbers around as a referencepoint. WORTH 666... 897... 466... QUENTIN 567... 898... ok? LEAVEN Yes! QUENTIN And 545... Did you get that? WORTH 656... 778... 462... LEAVEN That's enough. X is 17, y is 25 and z is 14. Which means this room makes two more moves before returning to it's original position. WORTH Do we have time? LEAVEN Maybe... QUENTIN Then let's go. WORTH Can you work out the traps in the system? QUENTIN Fuck the traps, let's get to the bridge. WORTH Well you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot. LEAVEN Technically I can identify the traps. WORTH Technically? LEAVEN First I thought they were identified by primenumbers, but they're not. They're identified by a number that are the power of a prime. QUENTIN Ok, so? WORTH Can you calculate that? LEAVEN The numbers are huge. QUENTIN But you can, right? You can? LEAVEN I have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set. Maybe if I had a computer... QUENTIN You don't need a computer. LEAVEN Yes, I do. QUENTIN Figure it out! LEAVEN Yes, I do! QUENTIN I'm not dying in a fucking ratmaze. LEAVEN Look! No one in the whole world could do it mentally! Look at the number: 567898545. There's no way I can factor that. I can't even start on 567. It's astronomical! KAZAN Two... Astronomical. WORTH What did you say? KAZAN Astronomical. WORTH Before that... KAZAN Factors... LEAVEN How many factors Kazan? Of 567? KAZAN Two... QUENTIN What are you fucking kidding? LEAVEN How many factors does 30 have? KAZAN Three... LEAVEN And seven? KAZAN One... Gumdrop. LEAVEN I don't have any gumdrops. KAZAN Gumdrop! WORTH Kazan, I'll give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer. KAZAN Gumdrops come in bags. WORTH You want 'em in bags, you got 'em in bags. KAZAN I don't like the red ones. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens a door and tells the numbers to Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH 8-9-8. KAZAN Two... WORTH 5-4-5. KAZAN Two... LEAVEN He's giving us the factors. KAZAN Astronomical. QUENTIN You're telling me Tell-A-Son boy is a genius. LEAVEN By those numbers the room should be safe. QUENTIN There's only one way to find out. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin takes Worth and throws him into the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Don't! WORTH Safe. QUENTIN Kazan, my man! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin tries to make Kazan give him the factors. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What's the numbers boy? Right here! Look here! Make him do it. LEAVEN Kazan, we gonna do some numbers, ok? We like to do numbers, right? KAZAN Primenumbers. LEAVEN That's right. Can you tell me the factors of 656? KAZAN Two... LEAVEN 779... KAZAN Two... LEAVEN 462... KAZAN Three... LEAVEN Clear. QUENTIN Move. Come on let's go. You too Worth. Move your scuddy ass Worth, I'm not through with you yet. Leaven open up that door, and get Einstein working on the numbers. -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin has his head in the room, Worth closes the door and tries to choke Quentin. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Oh, Jesus! WORTH Go! Hurry! QUENTIN Leaven. LEAVEN 563... Come on Kazan... 563... QUENTIN You fuckheads, you're dead! KAZAN Two... LEAVEN Clear... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin gets his head out, and Worth closes the door. Next we see the number 384. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN One.. LEAVEN Trapped! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth enters the room and closes the door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Check the floor. LEAVEN Is he dead? WORTH Not quite. QUENTIN Not even close, Worth! When I'm finish I'll throw you in a fucking trap on the way out of here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- On the other side of the door, we see Quentin opening the door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Where is he? Come here! I said come here riiight.......... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin falls down in the room under the floor. We see Worth hanging down there. Afterwards Leaven and Kazan help Worth up from there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Got ya. That way. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we see the number 805 -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Two... LEAVEN Clear. KAZAN Four... LEAVEN Clear. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The next door they open lead them to the edge again. This time there's much more light out there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Oh. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven puts her head outside the room, and quickly takes it back. A room is passing by. When they open the door again, there's a room there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH I guess that proves out theory. The numbers. -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see two numbers: 206 911 xxx -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Four, two, three. LEAVEN Clear. -------------------------------------------------------------------- They enter the new room, except Kazan, the room they just came from moves away. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN/WORTH KAZAN!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- In the background we hear Kazan screaming. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Listen. He hasn't moved far. WORTH I'm gonna find him. What do you think? LEAVEN You don't have a lot of lives left. -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see Kazan in a red room. He's terrified. Then we see Worth entering a blue room, then we see Leaven step on a piece of glass, the one from her glasses. Then we see Worth in the ceiling of the red room with Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Kazan? KAZAN I didn't move. WORTH Yeah, good. Erm, you have to climb up here, ok? KAZAN I don't like that. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a door and studies the numbers. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN 14... 26... 14... WORTH GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!! WORTH Five bags of gumdrops? KAZAN 27 bags total. WORTH 27 bags, deal. LEAVEN Come here Worth, this room's next move takes it to the bridge. WORTH We're coming. LEAVEN Over here. Move it. We don't have much time come on. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth and Kazan crawls in to Leaven's room. Leaven closes the door. They just make it, before the room moves. As we see the group again, they lie down. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Worth... WORTH Eaoh, it' better be it. LEAVEN It should be. WORTH Where? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a door, there's nothing behind it. She closes it again. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Ooh, arh. LEAVEN Give me a minute. Be patient. So guess what, this was the room we started in. I was right, we should never have moved in the first place. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The room starts to shake, it's moving. As it stops, Leaven opens the door. We see a red room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH The bridge. KAZAN Red... LEAVEN Kazan. KAZAN 38079 LEAVEN Clear!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- They enter the red room. Leaven closes the door. Kazan opens a new door. We see daylight. Worth sits down. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Worth??? WORTH Go ahead. LEAVEN What are you doing. You can't quit now. It's not your fault!!! WORTH I have nothing to live for out there. LEAVEN Was is out there. WORTH Boundless human stupidity. -------------------------------------------------------------------- In the background we hear a door opening. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN I can live with that. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven says some strange sounds, she rises. Behind her we see Quentin with a door handle. Quentin has stabbed Leaven in the back. He drops her to the floor. He's covered with blood. Kazan closes the door to the daily life. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Nooo! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth hits Quentin quite hard. But just after Quentin does the same to Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Kazan get out to the door! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin stabs Worth with the handle. Worth falls to the ground. Quentin tries to reach Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Red, Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan opens the door. Meanwhile the room starts to move. As Kazan is outside the room, Quentin grabs his t-shirt. As he is just halfway out he can't move anymore. Worth holds Quentins leg. Quentin gets split up in two parts. Afterwards we see the room move. There's blood on the inner cube. In the room again we see Worth crawl towards Leaven. Halfway he stops moving he dies. The last we see of the movie is Kazan looking at the inner cube, before he turns around and disappears into the bright, white light. --------------------------------------------------------------------
