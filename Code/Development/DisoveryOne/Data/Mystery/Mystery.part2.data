    As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink
    open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN
    near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind
    blowing, rattling a window.

                            A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
              What are you looking at?

                            CAROLINE
              The wind, Mother... They say a
              hurricane is on its way... You've
              been asleep... I was waiting to
              see you...

1   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          1

    Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white
    enamel paint trying without success to hide the years...
    An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green
    turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her
    blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's
    connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
    drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a
    Southern lilt.

                            DAISY
              If it wasn't for hurricanes we
              wouldn't have a hurricane season.

                            CAROLINE
              I've forgotten what the weather
              can be like here. I've lived with
              four seasons so many years now.

    We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver," DOROTHY BAKER,
    in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the
    window...

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              I saw on the news they're
              predicting trouble...

                            DAISY
              1928 they stacked people like
              firewood to close a hole in a
              levee.

    But Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                    2.

1   CONTINUED:                                                      1

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 It all runs together... like a
                 fingerpainting... I feel like I'm
                 on a boat, drifting...

                               CAROLINE
                      (tenderly)
                 Can I do anything for you, Mother?
                 Make anything easier?

                                DAISY
                 Hmmm. There is nothing to do,
                 Caroline. This is what it is...
                 I'm finding it harder to keep my
                 eyes open... my mouth all filled
                 with cotton...

    And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her
    nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take
    it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.

                               DOROTHY BAKER
                 There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll
                 scratch yourself to ribbons...
                      (to Caroline)
                 It's their way of letting go...
                      (the finality)
                 ...prob'ly today.

    Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her
    admonition of death being so close at hand, makes
    everything even more present...

                               CAROLINE
                 Do you want more medication,
                 Mother? The doctor said you can
                 have all you want.

    Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline,
    seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to
    cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter,
    comforting her.

                               CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                 A friend told me she never had a
                 chance to say goodbye to her
                 mother.
                      (grateful to have the
                       chance)
                 I wanted to thank you, Mother, for
                 bringing me into this world. For
                 raising me so well.

                            CAROLINE (CONT'D)
              I wanted to tell you how much
              you've meant to me. I'm going to
              miss you so much...

    They hold each other for some time... They separate...
    And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
    about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in
    their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal
    question...

                            CAROLINE (CONT'D)
              Are you afraid?

                             DAISY
              Curious.   What comes next...

    She winces at some physical pain.

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              The pain's coming more steadily...
              Her breathing will falter soon...
              No need for her to suffer..

    She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes...
    drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a
    sound, crosses her mind... and she says...

                            DAISY
              They built that train station in
              1918. Your father was there the
              day it opened... He said a tuba
              band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...

2   EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         2

    And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting
    ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
    TRAIN STATION...

                            DAISY
              Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The
              finest clockmaker in all of the
              South built that clock...

3   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917           3

    We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless
    array of clocks and watches...

                            DAISY'S (V.O.)
              His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr.
              Cake.

                                                                3A.



4   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       4

    The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to
    herself again... "Mr. Cake..."

5   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       5

    We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small,
    delicate hands, "Mr. Cake," working in his downstairs
    workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a
    handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop...




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                   4.

5   CONTINUED:                                                     5

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 He was married to a Creole of
                 Evangeline Parish and they had a
                 son.

    Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed.

                               DAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from
                 birth, absolutely blind.

6   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917              6

    ...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 And when their son came of age,
                 like boys will do, he joined the
                 army. They saw him off at the old
                 train station.

7   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917                7

    An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his
    parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other
    soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his
    hat goodbye to his son...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 Oh how he worked, for months he
                 did nothing but work on the clock
                 for the great train station.

8   INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918        8

    The sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at
    work...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 One day a letter came...

    Blanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her
    hand... She reads to her blind husband...

                               BLANCHE DEVEREUX
                 "I am sorry to inform you that
                 your son was killed fighting for
                 his country, at the battle of the
                 Marne. In the death of Sgt.
                 Martin Gateau I lose one of my
                 most trusted men.

                                BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D)
                  When I informed members of our
                  company he had fallen, on every
                  face could be seen the mark of
                  sorrow... ...we were in hope the
                  Lord would spare him to return
                  home together... Alas this was not
                  to be. I send along his pants,
                  shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and
                  haircomb."

                                DAISY (V.O.)
                  Mr. Gateau, done for the night,
                  went up to his bed.

     Mr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  And their son came home.

9    EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                9

     We see "Mr. Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding
     his arm, standing among the rows of coffins.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  They buried him where the Gateau
                  family had been buried for a
                  hundred and seven years...

10   EXT. NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1918                          10

     An old New Orleans cemetery, vines crawling the
     sepulchers.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Mr. Cake went back to work on his
                  clock... laboring to finish...

11   INT. THE CLOCK WORKSHOP, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1918        11

     Mr. Gateau blindly setting the last spring, closing up
     the clock back... finished at last.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  It was a morning to remember...
                  Papa said there were people
                  everywhere...

12   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918            12

     And we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling
     of the clock. Politicians, citizens, and pickpockets
     alike...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                  6.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Even Teddy Roosevelt had come.

     And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt,
     in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders. We
     watch Mr. Cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing
     the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape...
     He stands for a moment... and with a simple tug, releases
     the purple swath... People gasp at the magnificent
     clock... "Mr. Cake" winds the clock, which chimes a
     glorious chime... Pushed by an angel, the second-hand
     begins its eternal journey...going around... Everyone
     cheers... until they realize the clock is going the wrong
     way... traveling backwards in time... A man shouts, "It's
     running backwards!"

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  I made it this way... so that
                  perhaps, the boys who were lost in
                  the war might stand and go home
                  again...

13   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY, 1918                                13

     And we see just that... bullets leaving mens' wounds
     sailing back into the rifles from whence they came...
     limbs, whole again... cannon balls rocketing backwards
     into the cannons' breech... Fallen come to their feet, to
     live and breathe again.

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU (V.O.)
                  ... home to farm, to work, have
                  children, to live long, full
                  lives...

14   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         14

     Teddy Roosevelt, bereft, removes his hat...

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  Perhaps, my own son might come
                  home again...

15   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, ANOTHER TIME     15

     And we see his own son, Martin, once again full of life
     hopping backward off the train to land where his journey
     started... back in the arms of his loving parents...

                                                                  7.



16   INT. TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                  16

                             MONSIEUR GATEAU
               I'm sorry if I offended anybody. I
               hope you enjoy my clock.

     And his wife holding his arm, he makes his way across the
     terminal and exits... The crowd is motionless. They look
     to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance... but he simply puts his
     hat on, and with his guardians, is gone...

                             DAISY'S (V.O.)
               Mr Cake was never seen again.
               Some say he died of a broken
               heart. Some say he went to sea...

17   EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - AT THE END OF A DAY             17

     Mr. Gateau, blindly rowing... away...

18   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT           18

                             DAISY
               He just rowed...rowed...away...

     The wind loudly rattles the window...they turn to look...

                              DOROTHY BAKER
               Do you mind if I make myself a
               call? I've got somebody watching
               my little boy.

                             CAROLINE
               No, please go call...

     It's quiet, Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying
     mother... with the wind knocking at the window... After
     some moments:

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               I hope I haven't disappointed you,
               Mother.

                              DAISY
               Oh honey, you could never
               disappoint me.

                             CAROLINE
               I wished I had more to show for

               liked to have had grandchildren.

                  My life hasn't been all that...
                  normal...

     As if to say the pieces haven't all fit... trying to
     articulate it...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  I'm either a step ahead... or a
                  step behind...

                                   DAISY
                  What's normal?     A hat full of
                  sand.

                                   CAROLINE
                  What?

                                DAISY
                       (going on)
                  I need my brown suitcase... The
                  envelope...

                                   CAROLINE
                  An envelope?

     Caroline doing what she's asked goes over to one of the
     suitcases by the bed... She opens it... and among the
     clothes and the keepsakes, there is indeed an old
     envelope.

                                   CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  This one?

                                DAISY
                  I tried to read it a hundred
                  different times... but I couldn't
                  bring myself...

                                CAROLINE
                  What do you mean?

                                   DAISY
                  Read it to me.

     Daisy closes her eyes... Caroline takes out a sheath of
     papers... It's a journal of some kind written in
     longhand... Pages have come undone... scraps of paper,
     even some napkins...

     And for her mother's sake she begins to read it... with
     no particular interest, like reading to someone a
     selection from a menu's choices...

                             CAROLINE
               It's dated "April 4, 1985." It
               says, "New Orleans."
                    (after a beat)
               "This is my last will and
               testament...
                    (which starts to
                     engage her)
               I don't have much to leave... few
               possessions, no money really... I
               will go out of this world the same
               way I came in, alone and with
               nothing.
                    (finding herself
                     engaged)
               All I have is my story... I'm
               writing it now while I still
               remember it..."

     She's interested. She looks over at her mother.    But her
     mother's eyes are closed...

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               "My name is Benjamin..."

     And Caroline's voice becomes a young MAN'S voice...

                             A MAN'S (V.O.)
               "Benjamin Button... and I was born
               under unusual circumstances."

19   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                                19

     THERE'S SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               The war to end all wars had ended.

     We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with
     drunken, singing revelers... cars jamming the
     cobblestones, people kissing, shouting joyful... Another
     burst of fireworks.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I was told it was an especially
               good night to be born...

     And we see in the fireworks' light, a young MAN in his
     early 30s, THOMAS BUTTON, running up to the gate of a
     fashionable town home. He nearly collides with a PRIEST
     who arrives there at the same time. Thomas runs past
     him, up the steps...

20   INT. BUTTON HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                20

     ...He runs past a solemn Maid and up a long staircase...
     barging into the MASTER BEDROOM...

                                                                    10.



21   INT. MASTER BEDROOM, BUTTON HOUSE - NIGHT 1918                 21

     ... where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed,
     frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the
     help of the small domestic staff... the PRIEST enters...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
                    (seeing him)
               Why are you here?

                             THE DOCTOR
               Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going
               to survive...

     And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty
     young woman... and the maids, bringing bedsheets,
     futilely start to change her bloody linens...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
               That's enough...! All of you!

     They move out of the way... and Thomas kneels beside his
     wife... She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes...
     He takes her hand...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               I came as quickly as I could...
               I'm sorry I took so long, the
               streets are filled with people...

     As if to underscore it, fireworks go off...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               You are going to be alright, my
               dearest darling... I will not let
               anything happen to you...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE
               Promise me, Thomas...

     And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY.    But
     Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE (CONT'D)
               Promise me, he has a place...

     He doesn't understand... She looks up at him... holds his
     hand tight... then she slips away... The Doctor listening
     for her pulse... He covers her... it's quiet... the
     Priest's murmured incantations... the housemaids
     crying...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  She gave her life for me... And
                  for that I am forever grateful...

     Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go...
     When we hear again the BABY CRYING... The BABY'S CRY is
     not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor,
     or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a
     deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all
     turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY
     continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to
     answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick
     blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to
     lift it, to see his son's face...

                                   MAID
                  Mr. Button...!

     He lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has
     seen some kind of horror... He makes the smallest of
     sounds, a whispered "Ohhhh." And then he suddenly
     snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of
     the room... downstairs... outside...

22   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                              22

     ... Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY,
     through the streets... Pushing through crowds...

23   EXT. A BRIDGE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                    23

     ... he comes along an old bridge over a waterway... the
     air heavy with the haze of fireworks... the water dark...
     brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the
     black water... He is just at the apex of this throw when,
     despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it...
     Instead, cradles the newborn...

                                THOMAS
                  I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

     A LANTERN lights his face... A POLICEMAN down the way...

                                POLICEMAN
                  What are you doing there!?

     The BABY starts to CRY...

                                POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                  What do you have there?

     Thomas takes off... the Policeman after him... Thomas,
     carrying the CRYING BABY, running...

                                                                  12.



23A   EXT. NEW ORLEANS, GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1918             23A

      Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow
      streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the
      large old moldering antebellum houses...

24    EXT. THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT, 1918     24

      He comes to an old three-story house with a screened
      porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and
      LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light,
      by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops
      its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath...
      He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of
      VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back
      porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has,
      tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can
      just see the figures of two people coming from inside...
      Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his
      decision made, he turns, moving away from the house,
      leaving his child behind.

                              A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                I could've sworn I heard somebody
                knockin'...

      When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto
      the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s,
      with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as
      QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR.
      WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the
      door, and not seeing anything...

                                 QUEENIE
                I guess not...

      She stands for a moment taking in the night air...

                              QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                The air smells sweet...

      And she sings to herself... a song from the time...

                              TIZZY
                You look very handsome tonight,
                Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever
                seen you... The green matches
                your eyes...

                              QUEENIE
                     (fingering dress)
                It isn't everyday a war's over,

                  We have to mark it somehow... You
                  ain't no slouch yourself.

     He smiles, tips his hat... And they stand in the quiet...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert's back in town... came
                  home legless, but he home... we're
                  gonna throw a party for him...
                  help get himself situated...
                       (beat)
                  I know you was sweet on him one
                  time...

                                QUEENIE
                  Sweeter than I shoulda been...
                  Lost his legs you say? "You never
                  know what's comin' for you."

     And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head
     out...

                                OLD WOMAN
                  Ms. Simone messed herself...

                                QUEENIE
                  She got to stop doing that, or
                  it's diapers for her... I'll be
                  right there, Mrs. Jameson...

     The woman disappears inside.    Queenie, not anxious to
     go...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  It sure is nice out here, Mr.
                  Weathers...

                                TIZZY
                  Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come
                  out back for a moment... take your
                  mind away from things...

     He pushes open the porch screen door...

                                QUEENIE
                       (smiles)
                  Just a moment's time...

     He offers her his hand... She takes it... He backs out of
     the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right
     on top of the Baby... The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles,
     nearly falls...

               What is that?     A fish crawl out of
               the river...?

     She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               God in heaven!

     IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we
     see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it
     has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an
     octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it
     would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed
     old man...

                             QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               My Goodness, the Lord did

               Look like a milk wagon run over
               it... three times... and back...

     And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I didn't see it layin' there... I
               hope I didn't hurt it none...
               steppin' on it like that...

     The BABY won't stop its mournful cry...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               We best leave it to the police...
               I'll go --

     Queenie hesitates... a longing.

                             QUEENIE
               It's for sure nobody wanted to
               keep it...

     And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying
     baby, taking it inside... Tizzy, anxiously whispering
     something, going in after her...

                                                                  15.



25   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918              25

     A piano's playing a standard, people singing.... There's
     a myriad of old dark rooms... heavy furniture and
     carpets... an eclectic mixture of the possessions of
     those who have lived and died here over many years... and
     we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to
     ninety-five, in various stages of health... various
     contraptions to keep them "afloat". An Old Age Home. We
     see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the
     crying baby so as not to be seen. Tizzy, following her,
     still anxiously whispering after her...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Where are you, Queenie...?

                             QUEENIE
               Hold your water...
                    (and to Tizzy)
               Go see to them.

     He does what she asks. She hurries the baby into a small
     room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs...

26   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM, OLD HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918     26

     A small room tucked under the staircase...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Queenie Apple... she went and
               messed herself all over again...

                             QUEENIE
               Jane Childress start her a bath...
               and mind your business, Mrs.
               Duprey... You'll be messing
               yourself soon enough too!

     There's a KNOCK on Queenie's door.

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                    (whispers)
               Somebody stole my necklace...

                             QUEENIE
               I'll be right with you, Mrs.
               Hollister...

     She whispers to The Baby, soothing it. And looking for a
     place to put it, she opens a dresser drawer...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                16.

26   CONTINUED:                                                 26

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  You may be as ugly as an old
                  pot... but you still a child of
                  God...

                                A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                  Queenie, Apple... she won't go
                  take a bath wit'out you...

                                QUEENIE
                  Mercy, I'll be right there.

     And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser
     drawer... with her unmentionables... and shuts it...
     leaving it open just a crack, enough to breathe...
     Turning, she sees an Old Woman, looking very lost,
     looking in the room...

                                MRS. HOLLISTER
                  My sister gave those pearls to
                  me... I can't find them
                  anywhere... People are stealing my
                  jewelry...!

                                 QUEENIE
                  They're right here, Mrs.
                  Hollister, right 'round your
                  pretty white neck...
                       (moving her)
                  Come on now...

     There's a sound of a door chime...

                                A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                  Dr. Rose has arrived for his
                  visit...

     Queenie takes a concerned look back at the Baby, and
     closes the door... And we stay behind for a moment...
     inside Queenie's underwear drawer, with the smell of a
     lilac sachet... is the Baby with the face of an old
     man... looking up at the sliver of light coming into the
     dresser drawer...

27   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918        27

     We see the Doctor, an older man in a tired suit, who has
     done this longer than he cares to remember, finishing
     examining one of the elderly boarders. He puts his
     things into his doctor's bag. Queenie comes beside him,
     saying something...

                                                                  17.



28   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT, 1918                       28

     The Baby is lying on Queenie's bed... Dr. Rose,
     stethoscope ever dangling, washes his hands in a sink.

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               ... He's nearly blind from
               cataracts... I'm not sure he can
               hear... His bones indicate severe
               arthritis... His skin has lost all
               elasticity... His hands and feet
               are ossified... He has all the
               deterioration, the infirmities,
               not of a newborn, but of a man
               well in his eighties on the way to
               his grave...

                             QUEENIE
               You mean to say he's dying?

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               Of old age. His body is failing
               him before his life's begun.

     They're still, looking at the strange baby.

                             DOCTOR ROSE (CONT'D)
               Where did he come from?

                             QUEENIE
                    (after a beat)
               It's my sister's child... From
               Lafayette. She had an unfortunate
               adventure.
                    (whispers)
               The poor child got the worse of
               it... came out white...

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               There are places for 'unwanted'
               babies like these, Queenie...
               There's no room for another mouth
               to feed here... The Nolan
               Foundation, despite their good
               intentions, thinks this place is a
               large nuisance as it is... A baby
               here --

                             QUEENIE
                    (appealing)
               You said he don't have long.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                     18.

28   CONTINUED:                                                      28

                                DOCTOR ROSE
                  Queenie -- some creatures aren't
                  meant to survive.

     She looks at the Baby, determined.

                                QUEENIE
                  He is a miracle, that's for
                  certain... just not the kind of
                  miracle one hopes to see...

29   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1918                     29

     The Old People are sitting around the parlor talking,
     playing cards... Queenie brings the baby bundle into the
     room.

                                QUEENIE
                  You all listen...

     And they stop what they are doing...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  We have a visitor that will be
                  staying with us for a little
                  while... My sister had a child but
                  couldn't see right by it... He's
                  known as...
                       (a hesitation naming him)
                  Benjamin...
                       (she likes the sound
                        of it)
                  Benjamin... He's not a well
                  child... so we need to take very
                  good care of him...

     We see Tizzy's come out of the kitchen , watching with an
     air of strong disapproval... And an OLD WOMAN says...

                                ONE OF THE WOMEN
                  I had ten children... there's not
                  a baby I can't care for... let me
                  see him...

     Queenie hesitates, and gives the Baby to her... The Old
     Woman pushes the blanket back from the baby's face...

                                THE OLD WOMAN
                       (startled)
                  God in heaven, he looks just like
                  my ex-husband...

     And there's laughter...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 19.

29   CONTINUED:                                                  29

                                QUEENIE
                  He's prematurely old... Doctor
                  Rose said he don't have much time
                  on this earth...

                                   A MAN
                  Join the club.

     They all laugh. Their laughter makes the baby seem to
     smile... the lonely smile of an old, dying man.

30   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT, 1918          30

     We see Queenie, unable to sleep, lying in bed, looking
     out a small window... there's a light KNOCK on the
     door... Tizzy...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert sends his remembrance to
                  you.

     She nods... The baby cries out... and then it's quiet...

                                TIZZY (CONT'D)
                       (meaning the baby)
                  Are you right out of your mind? I
                  know you don't got all the parts
                  it takes to make one of your
                  own... but this isn't yours to
                  keep... this isn't even human
                  kind...

     With nothing left to be said, he starts to go...

                                QUEENIE
                       (whispers)
                  Mr. Weathers. Stay with me
                  tonight.

     He slows.    She's quiet.     And she whispers:

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  "You never know what's comin' for
                  you."

     And as they move to be with one another, to make love; we
     look over at the dresser drawer -- open just a crack...
     Benjamin lying among the unmentionables, looking out at
     the world...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I found a home...

                                                                  20.



31   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           31

     Caroline with the "journal" on her knees. Daisy, eyes
     closed... the wind gathered in strength... furiously
     knocking...

                             CAROLINE
               Is any of this true?

                             DAISY
               You have such a lovely voice.

     Caroline shrugs.   She looks through the "book..."

                             CAROLINE
               Some pages seem to be torn out
               here...

     She discovers inside...

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               There's an old streetcar token.

     She gives it to her mother, folding her hand around it.
     But Daisy is somewhere else, looking out the window...

                             DAISY
               That clock... Just kept going,
               year after year after year...

32   INT. "NEW" TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1925    32

     And we see "Mr. Cake's" clock with its cherubs pushing
     the "hands of progress," still marking time backwards...
     The year is now, "1925..."

33   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM, NEW ORLEANS -            33
     EVENING, 1925

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               "...I didn't know I was a child.
               I thought I was like everyone else
               who lived there, an old man, in my
               "golden years."

     The boarders eating dinner. Queenie, in a white
     uniform... along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and
     apron, helping her serve. We move across the ancient
     faces... until we come to one particular face... Wearing
     eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come
     to know... the face of a very old man...



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                 21.

33   CONTINUED:                                                  33

     The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a
     six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small,
     shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with
     arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a
     hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one
     ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are
     sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the
     last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we
     watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might,
     banging it just for the hell of it making noise...

                                QUEENIE
                  Stop bangin' that fork...
                       (fixing it in his
                        arthritic hand)
                  It's for eating, not for playin'
                  with... And use your napkin,
                  please Mr. Benjamin...

     And he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of
     the old men, feeding him... Benjamin just another old man
     having dinner with his contemporaries.

34   EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925      34

     A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six-
     year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between
     them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough,
     sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making
     him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the
     other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking...
     Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children
     playing... people talking...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON
                  What's there?

     Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally
     curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself
     precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall
     is lower and he just sees the street... children running
     on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off
     for a party... He leans forward to get an even better
     view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him...

                                QUEENIE
                  Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come
                  back here...!

     ...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the
     safety of the old people... out of sight of the street...

                                                                  22.



35   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1925                            35

     The small room with the small window. We see Benjamin in
     a bed made on the floor... Queenie in her bed...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I loved her very much. She was my
               mother.

     And he reaches to hold her hand. She generously takes
     his hand... And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie
     in bed, her "son", the "old man" on the floor...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON
               Somedays I feel like I'm different
               from the day before...

                             QUEENIE
               Everybody feels different about
               themselves one way or another.
               We're all goin' the same way, just
               taking different roads to get
               there... You're on your own road,
               Benjamin.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON
               How much longer do I have to live,
               Mother?

                             QUEENIE
               Just be thankful you got what
               you're given. You already here
               longer than you supposed to be.

     We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Some nights, I would have to sleep
               alone.

     He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying
     him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy
     going back down into the room to be with Queenie...
     shutting the door...

36   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925            36

     An Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a
     book on her lap. Benjamin sitting alone in his
     wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I didn't mind. I would listen to
                  the house breathing. All the
                  people sleeping. I felt safe.

     Be he still wants to know "What's over there?" He wheels
     himself over to sit at the window looking outside...
     looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate...
     trying to see what's dangerous...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  It was a place of great routine...
                  Every morning at 5:30, no matter
                  the weather... General Winslow,
                  U.S. Army Retired... raised the
                  flag...

37   EXT. THE FRONT LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                  37

     And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just
     that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's
     naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with
     a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING
     OPERA...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                  Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted
                  opera singer... well, she'd sing,
                  Wagner...

38   INT. MRS. WAGNER'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925              38

     We see a Victrola playing, Mrs. Wagner in her nightgown
     at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the
     top of her lungs... while, down the hall we see Queenie
     giving Benjamin a bath... massaging his poor crippled
     legs...

                                 QUEENIE
                  We're gonna put some life into
                  these old sticks for you... get
                  you walkin'...

                  Breakfast was served promptly at

39   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                     39

     We see Benjamin in his wheelchair, under Tizzy's
     tutelage, learning to cook... and simultaneously, to
     read...

     Some staff come in getting platters of food...

     Tizzy smacks the back of his head.

40   INT. KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1925                      40

     Tizzy washing dishes...Benjamin working with him...
     putting away cans... reading from one of the labels...

                             BENJAMIN
               Tomato, brown sugar, salt,
               myasses...

     Tizzy swats at him with his dish towel...

                               TIZZY
               "Molasses"...

     And while washing the dishes...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I learned to read when I was five.
               My grandfather was a dresser for a
               famous actor. He'd bring home
               every play for me to read.
                    (Shakespeare)
               "Kind keepers of my weak decaying
               age, Let dying Mortimer here rest
               himself. Even like a man new
               haled from the rack. So fare my
               limbs with long imprisonment. And
               these gray locks, the pursuivants
               of death, Nestor-like aged in an
               age of care, Argue the end of
               Edmund Mortimer."

     Benjamin's mouth agape, awed, taken by him, his majesty.

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               You thought I was plain ignorant,
               didn't you?

     Benjamin never thought about it...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               The actor my grandfather worked
               for was John Wilkes Booth. He
               killed Abraham Lincoln. You never
               know...

     An old man looks in...

                             A MAN
               When's dessert...?

                  When it's served. Now sit your
                  wrinkly butt back down, Mr. Lee.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  On Saturday nights I would go to
                  Queenie's church...

41   INT. CHURCH TENT, NEW ORLEANS - A SATURDAY NIGHT, 1926           41

     A sweltering shout 'em up Negro gospel tent. Queenie
     pushes Benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people
     looking to be healed, bringing him face to face with a
     mountain of a PREACHER, pouring sweat and full of fire...

                                THE PREACHER
                  What can I do for you, Sister?

     And Queenie whispers something to him.

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Her parts are all twisted up
                  inside so she can't have little
                  children...

     He puts his hand on her stomach...

                                PREACHER
                  Lord, if you could see clear to
                  forgive this woman her sins so she
                  can bear the fruit of the womb.
                       (and shouts)
                  Out damnable affliction!

     He presses on her stomach... making Queenie nearly fall
     over... held up by a "NURSE" in a crisp white uniform.
     And once she's regained her balance...

                                THE PREACHER
                       (at Benjamin)
                  And what's this old man's
                  irrediction?

                                QUEENIE
                  He's got the devil on his back...
                  trying to ride him into the grave
                  before his time...

                                THE PREACHER
                       (touches Benjamin)
                  Out, Zebuchar! Out, Beelzebub!
                       (after a beat)
                  How old are you?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      27.

     And he says what is only true.

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm seven, but I look a lot older.

                                   PREACHER
                       (laughs)
                  God bless you.    He's seven!

     The congregation laughs...

                                THE PREACHER
                  This is a man who has optimism in
                  his heart! Belief in his soul!
                  We are all children in the eyes of
                  God. Now we are going to get you
                  out of that chair... we're gonna
                  have you walk...
                       (his hands on Ben's
                        shoulders)
                  In the name of God's glory, rise
                  up!

     And Benjamin, doing what he's asked, barely able to, his
     legs akimbo, stands... The people all applaud...

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Now God is going to see you the
                  rest of the way... He's going to
                  see this little old man walk
                  without the use of a crutch or a
                  cane...! He's going walk by
                  himself on faith and divine
                  inspiration alone...! We'll show
                  that Devil where to go...! Walk
                  on...!

     And Benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor
     arthritic legs give out... and he sprawls to the floor...
     The Aides in white nurse's uniforms move to help, but:

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Don't touch him!
                       (kneeling to Benjamin)
                  Rise up, old man!

     But Benjamin stays crumpled on the floor... The Preacher
     comes to his feet, standing like a mountain over him...

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Rise up like Lazarus!

     Benjamin still lies on the floor...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                   28.

41   CONTINUED: (2)                                                41

                             THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
               I said rise up!!

     And Benjamin, slowly but surely, makes his way to his
     feet...

                             THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
               Yes, and say hallelujah!
                    (Hallelujah!)
               Now walk, my old friend...
               Walk on...!

     And Benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across
     the stage... The people urging him on... a string of
     "Hallelujahs...!" Queenie comes to join him... urging
     him...

                             QUEENIE
               Let the Lord carry you... ...

     ...The Preacher, walking along with him, more a dance
     than a walk, shouting the name of the Lord... Queenie and
     The Preacher walking Benjamin across the stage...
     Benjamin making it to the other end... to a roar of
     "Amens"!

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Now, when I look back on it, it
               was kind of miraculous... But you
               know the saying, "...the Lord
               Giveth and the Lord Taketh
               away..."

     ... That mountain of a Preacher... in full exaltation to
     God...

                             THE PREACHER
               Praise be to the Lord on the
               highest...!

     Suddenly pitches over, flat on his face... Having had a
     spontaneous coronary... lying center-stage, deader than
     the proverbial doornail... The crisp uniformed "nurses"
     running to attend to him, and poor "old" Benjamin
     haplessly looking around.

42   INT. THE PARLOR ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY 1926          42

     The people are gathered...

       A lit cake is being brought in celebrating General
       Winslow's birthday. He stares at the cake, unhappily
       gets up, mutters something... and leaves. The oldsters
       eye the cake, and without a moment's hesitation, dig
       in...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                    And mortality was a common visitor
                    to our house... People came and
                    went... Death was so frequent, I
                    was never afraid of it.

43     EXT. NOLAN HOUSE, ANOTHER MORNING, 1926                        43

       Mrs. Wagner's window open... and not a sound coming
       out...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                    You could hear when someone left
                    us... there was a silence in the
                    house...

44     EXT. AN OLD NEW ORLEANS' CEMETERY - DAY, 1926                  44

       A small funeral at   an old cemetery... And while "DIE
       VALKYRIE" PLAYS on   her crank VICTROLA, an old man bangs
       cymbals as a grand   finale to the music... while we see
       SYBIL WAGNER, laid   to rest to sing in another choir:

45     EXT. THE FRONT PORCH, THE NOLAN HOUSE - DUSK, 1926             45

       Benjamin with his wondrous ancient face sitting in his
       wheelchair with the old people on the porch... watching
       the sun go down...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                    It was a wonderful place to grow
                    up. I was with people who had put
                    away all the inconsequences of
                    life, left in a state of purely
                    being...wondering about the
                    weather...the temperature of a
                    bath...the light at the end of the
                    day...

       And one of them, as if to underscore the point, farts...

47B   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY, 1927           47B

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                For everyone that died, someone
                would come to take their place...

      And we see Benjamin coming into the kitchen... Tizzy busy
      preparing lunch... Benjamin stops, seeing a tiny African
      man, his back to us, surrounded by old people standing on
      the lawn... He hears him telling them...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                ... My first wife and I are
                captured by neighbor tribe,
                cannibals...

      The old people shrink at the mention...

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                I escaped across the river...

                              AN OLD WOMAN
                     (wide eyed)
                You escaped cannibals?

                              NGUNDA OTI
                My wife, she can't swim, so she
                eaten.

                              TIZZY
                     (telling Benjamin)
                That's Mr. Oti... He's an
                acquaintance of an acquaintance of
                mine...he'll be stayin' with us in
                the staff quarters for awhile...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                     (telling old people)
                ...Second wife stepped on viper
                and dies... (jocular) It was bad
                luck to be married to Mr. Oti.

      They laugh.

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                I am captured with six others by
                Baschiele tribe. They sell us to a
                big white man...

      He instinctively turns and sees Benjamin standing in the
      window watching him. When Mr. Oti spots him he quickly
      moves out of the window out of sight.

                                                                   31.



47C   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME, 1927            47C

      We see Benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing
      with some metal army men... when Mr. Oti's distinctive
      laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs...
      Benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look... Mr. Oti,
      standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the
      help, telling them his life story... but it's a
      completely different tone... a mockery of white people
      and their insanity...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                The Big White Man brings us to St.
                Louis, where they make our village
                at the 1904 World's Fair... They
                have us livin' in these little
                huts like we're livin' in
                Africa... people behind bars
                staring at us... we told not to
                look at them... to just go about
                our normal lives... what the hell
                they talkin' about... ?

      They all laugh...

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                At night we're done bein'
                "savages..." we go over the wall
                into The Rosebud... we drank and
                laughed until the sun come up...
                and then we savages again...

      They nod enjoying the idea... And as Mr. Oti senses
      Benjamin's presence, turning... Benjamin retreating on
      his canes as fast as he can back up the stairs...

47D   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1927            47D

      Benjamin sitting at the dining room table reading an
      oversized book of "Imaginary Beings..." He senses a
      presence... and Mr. Oti sits down across from him.

                              NGUNDA OTI
                I hear you not so old as you
                looking. You just foolin'
                everybody. What happen, you get
                Madjembe?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What's a madjembe?

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Worms.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't think so. This is just
                   how I am.

      Mr. Oti looks out at the street.

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   You want to get a cold root beer?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (an echo)
                   It's dangerous.

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Who said that?

      He gets up ready to go. Benjamin hesitates. He can see
      Queenie busy leaning out a window banging dust from a
      rug.

                                 NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                        (last chance)
                   ...Come on little man...

      Despite knowing the consequences he takes up his canes
      and follows Ngunda outside...

49    EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927       49

      They come outside. Children on the street playing.
      Seeing Benjamin, they come to a dead stop... staring at
      the freak from the old people's home, with another
      freak... Mr. Oti suddenly runs into the street...

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Hurry...

      Benjamin tries as best he can to keep up... Mr. Oti darts
      directly in front of a street car, waving his arms,
      making it come to an abrupt stop...




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                   country and say he want to talk to
                   me...

50    INT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927                 50

      We move along the aisle of a streetcar... the various
      people...

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   Then I am in the monkey house at
                   "Philadelphia Zoological Park."
                   Three thousand people show up my
                   first day...

      Benjamin and Ngunda siting in the back of the streetcar
      behind a moveable metal bar that has "Coloreds" painted
      on it... Mr. Oti taking a slug from a flask... A group of
      school children nearby can't take their eyes off the two
      of them... Mr. Oti takes his wallet out, taking out a
      folded piece of newspaper, showing it to Benjamin...
      "Bushman shares cage with park apes."

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What's it like living in a cage?

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   It stinks. The monkeys, they do
                   some tricks... I throw spear... I
                   wrestle with Kowali, she is
                   orangutan... They have me file my
                   teeth like a cannibal...

      He shows him his teeth filed into points like a
      cannibal...

                                 NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                   When I'm not playing with monkeys -
                   - they want me to run to bars in
                   my cage with teeth to scare little
                   children...

      And he suddenly jumps up and does just that, charging
      with his teeth bared at the school children... They
      scream... Mr. Oti, taking his seat again, laughs with
      Benjamin...

50A   INT. (OR) EXT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY             50A

      Benjamin, ecstatic, his head out the streetcar window,
      Mr. Oti holding onto the back of his breeches from
      falling... Benjamin feeling the wind and the city wash
      over him...

                                                                 34.



51   EXT. THE PERISTYLE, NEW ORLEANS - PARK - END OF DAY, 1927   51

     Benjamin and Mr. Oti sitting on a bench at the peristyle
     of a park. Benjamin takes his first slug of a coca cola,
     taking too big a hit, the coke pouring out of his nose...
     Mr. Oti gives him a handkerchief... after he's wiped
     himself up...

                             BENJAMIN
               Why didn't you go back home?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               War between English and Dutch
               people had broken up kingdom.

                             BENJAMIN
               What did you do?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               I leave zoo. Go here. Go there.
               Everything okay. But I alone.

                             BENJAMIN
               You were all alone?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               You'll see little man, plenty
               times you be alone. You different
               like us, it's gonna be that way.
               But I tell you a little secret I
               find out. We know we alone. Fat
               people, skinny people, tall
               people, white people... they just
               as alone as us... But they scared
               shitless...

     He smiles a knowing smile...

                             NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
               Not a thing wrong with being
               alone... no sir...

     He looks out...

                             NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
               I think about the river I grew up
               on. It would be good to sit by my
               river again.

     He looks at his watch.   He suddenly gets up...

                                                                 34A.



52   EXT. BOURBON STREET CORNER, NEW ORLEANS - DUSK, 1927         52

     Mr. Oti and Benjamin coming along the street, music
     pouring out... They reach a corner where a tall octoroon
     woman is waiting. She broadly smiles seeing Mr. Oti.

                             THE WOMAN
               There's my little man. You ready,
               sugar.

                  Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

                                FILAMENA GILEA
                       (respectful of his
                        age)
                  It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir.

                                NGUNDA OTI
                       (to Benjamin)
                  You can find your own way home,
                  can't you?

     Although he's not sure he can... he nods, yes.

                                NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                  The St. Charles Avenue line to
                  Napoleon...

     And with that, his arm around Filamena's waist, the two
     of them laughing, walk off... Benjamin's left standing on
     the street corner... he looks around to get his
     bearings... he moves along Bourbon Street... A streetcar
     comes along, bell clanging, it rushes by him... he
     watches it go... Clasping his canes, determined, he
     starts walking... bent over, one cane after the other...
     making his way along the street...

53   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1927                53

     We see Benjamin coming back to the gate... and we hear:

                  Where in God's name have you
                  been?!!

     And we see Queenie standing on the porch... She's worried
     sick... she sees his hands are bleeding from blisters.

54   INT. KITCHEN, QUEENIE'S SINK, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT               54

     Queenie cleaning his hands...

                  Like to scare the Holy Hell out of
                  me! I was so worried about

                  Shallow.

     Dorothy nods.

                  late in the day... I'm goin' to
                  get my baby and take him to my
                  sister's... they said there's
                  nothin' to worry about here in the
                  hospital...Nurses are right here
                  if you need them...I'll see you in
                  about an hour if that'll be

                  No, that's fine...please...

     She leaves. It's momentarily quiet, the wind knocking at
     the window... Daisy, ruminating...

                                DAISY
                  Was there just company?

                  Dorothy had to go home...

     But Daisy's mind is elsewhere...gesturing for her to keep
     reading...

                                DAISY
                  Caroline...

     Caroline looks back at the book.       Daisy closes her
     eyes...

56   EXT. THE LAWN, THE NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1930                   56

     The boarders on the lawn with their loved ones... And we          *
     see an OLD MAN, walking with the aid of a cane coming out         *
     of the house onto the lawn... And as he moves through the         *
     people we see it's Benjamin... He has a single cane,              *
     standing more upright now, a distinctive shock of white
     hair, eyebrows... A distinguished looking man in his              *
     seventies, or, in normal years, a growing twelve-year-old
     boy...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               It was Thanksgiving 1930, I met
               the person who changed my life
               forever.

     A chauffeured car has stopped... A Man is standing in the
     road, looking at the house through the gates... And we
     realize it's THOMAS BUTTON... looking for a glimpse of
     his son... Benjamin instinctively turns, but it's too
     late, his father's back in the car, being driven away...

57   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THANKSGIVING, 1930           57

     The families, along with Ngunda and Filamena, are
     gathered in the dining room, their heads bowed in prayer.
     We see Daisy across from Benjamin... The prayer's
     finished, it's noisy...

                             NGUNDA OTI
               We pray to Bembe... the creator of
               all living things... she retired
               after all that work...

                             DAISY
                    (needing to top that)
               Did you know turkeys aren't really
               birds...?

                             BENJAMIN
               Why do you say that?

                             DAISY
               They're in the pheasant family.
               They can hardly fly. It's sad
               don't you think? A bird, that
               can't fly.

                             NGUNDA OTI
               I like birds that can't fly.
               They're easy to eat.

     They're quiet.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  While we're giving thanks for
                  God's blessings... I've had a
                  miracle happen.
                       (she touches her
                        stomach)
                  The Lord saw fit to answer my
                  prayers.

     The people applaud the good news.

                                BENJAMIN
                  What does she mean "answered her
                  prayers?"

                                DAISY
                  She's going to have a baby, silly.
                  That's what my mother said when I
                  was going to have a little
                  brother. He didn't live long
                  though. He didn't breathe
                  right...

     And we can see Benjamin's heart beginning to break... he
     looks over, Tizzy, proudly smiling... And as Queenie
     accepts congratulations... Benjamin's old wrinkled face,
     watching her... looks like he's going to cry...

58   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER, 1930                    58

59   INT. A ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT, 1930                 59

     We see Benjamin asleep in bed with one of the Old Men,
     MR. DAWS. The door opens. And Daisy, in her nightgown,
     has come inside... she slightly touches Benjamin...

     and with the aid of his cane, follows her...

60   INT. BACK STAIRWELL, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930            60

     The old house still. Daisy, moving quietly down the
     stairs. Benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps,
     following her.

                    (whispers)
               Where are we going?

     She doesn't say anything. She leads him into the DINING
     ROOM... where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and
     pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and
     a smaller side table, and a buffet...to dry...

                               DAISY
               Under here...

     And she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table...
     Benjamin follows her into the "fort..."

     They sit... The little girl, and the old man with the
     maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret
     lair... She takes a candle out of the folds of her
     nightgown... She tries to light it, but doesn't really
     know how to use matches...

                  Don't be chicken...

     Despite his caution, he lights the candle... the
     candlelight making it feel more secret...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                  I'll tell you a secret then you
                  tell me one...
                       (whispers)
                  I saw mommy kissing another man.
                  Her face was red from it.

     Benjamin doesn't know what to say.

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                  Your turn to tell.

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm younger than I look.

                                DAISY
                       (whispers)
                  You don't seem like an old
                  person... like my grandma... Are
                  you sick?

                                BENJAMIN
                       (whispers)
                  I heard Tizzy and my mother
                  whisper. They said I was going to
                  die soon.
                       (smiles)
                  But I fooled them so far.

     Daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight.

                                DAISY
                  You are different than anybody I
                  have ever met. Can I?


                                                       (CONTINUED)

     She innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to
     see what it feels like... When suddenly a sheet is pulled
     back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there.

                             GRANDMA FULLER
               What are you doing under there?
               Who's idea was this candle?

     She angrily blows it out... and... to Daisy... taking her
     by the arm...

                             GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D)
               It's after midnight, you come
               right out here and get back up to
               bed...!
                    (and for Benjamin,
                     but saying it to
                     Daisy)
               You are not to be playing
               together! Play with people your
               own age...!
                    (moving her along)
               Now, you come back to bed, young
               lady...! You're too young to be
               wandering around in the night by
               yourself...
                    (and a last word to
                     Benjamin)
               You should be ashamed of yourself!

     And they're gone... Benjamin left sitting along under the
     sheets. There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in
     her nightgown, standing in the doorway...

                             QUEENIE
               You are a different child... a man
               child. People aren't going to
               understand how different you are.

                             BENJAMIN
                    (forlorn)
               What's wrong with me, Mother?

                             QUEENIE
               God hasn't said yet. Now, back to
               bed and behave yourself.

     He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane,
     and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the
     back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask.
     He looks at Benjamin as he goes by.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    (takes a drink)
               You get used to it...

                             QUEENIE (V.O.)
                    (shouts)
               You get back in that bed or I'll
               cane your old ass!

     Benjamin turns down the hallway and slips into the
     bedroom --

61   INT. BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930                 61

     Benjamin climbing back into bed with the Old Man.
     Turning his back to the old man. And Mr. Daws, unable to
     sleep...

                             MR. DAWS
               Did I ever tell you I've been
               struck by lightning seven times.
               Once, when I was fixing a leak on
               the roof.

     And we see just that, the old man on a roof getting
     blasted.

                             MR. DAWS (CONT'D)
               Once, when I was crossing the road
               to get the mail...

     And we see that, the man peacefully crossing a country
     road to get the mail, getting hit by lightning... But
     Benjamin just lays there looking out the window... all he
     can think about... despite everything...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I never forgot her blue eyes...

62   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           62

     The words linger. Daisy, her extraordinary blue eyes,
     lying on her death bed... the rattle of the window in the
     wind...

                             CAROLINE
               Are you alright, Mother?

     She nods "yes."

                  This man. He loved you from the
                  first time he saw you.

     She doesn't say anything.

                                CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                       (without complaint)
                  Nobody has ever loved me that way.

                                DAISY
                       (impelling her)
                  Go on.

                                CAROLINE
                  He crossed out something... and
                  then he's written... "When..."

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  "...When the baby came things were
                  different..."

63   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1931                     63

     We see Benjamin in his pajamas, quietly coming into the
     kitchen for something to eat... And he slows, seeing
     Queenie, taking a moment to herself, sitting at the
     kitchen table, peacefully breast-feeding her infant... as
     Benjamin slips back out unseen, closing the door after
     him...

64   INT. ATTIC, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1931                           64

     We see Benjamin lying on a small bed in the ATTIC...
     cluttered with years of accumulated things...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I moved into my own room in the
                  attic... I realized, despite a
                  house filled with people that I
                  loved, I was alone...

     There's a noise. And we see Ngunda Oti is at the door, a
     suitcase in hand.

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  I come to say goodbye. I'm going
                  away.

                                 BENJAMIN
                  Going away?   Where?



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  I don't figure that out yet. I
                  will send you a postcard when I
                  get to there.

                                BENJAMIN
                  What about your friend?   The tall
                  lady?

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  We're not friends anymore. That's
                  what happens with tall people.

     He starts to go...

                                BENJAMIN
                  Goodbye...

     And he's gone.   Benjamin gets up going to the window.
     He looks outside. He can see Mr. Oti come onto the
     porch. There's a full moon. And as he walks off, his
     arrogant little walk, suitcase in hand, going out the
     gate, Benjamin watches him disappear into the night.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I spent a lot of time by myself
                  that year...

65   INT. FRONT ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1931                  65

     Benjamin sitting at a table, an old man to look at but no
     more than twelve, busy playing with magnets...

                                BENJAMIN (V.O)
                  Until...

     We see a refined, genteel OLD WOMAN, wearing a hat and
     gloves, a suitcase at her feet, flanked by an old DOG,
     just inside the front door...

                                BENJAMIN               (CONT'D)
                  Hello...

                                THE WOMAN
                  I'm moving in today.

     And just then Queenie appears, the baby on her hip...

                                QUEENIE
                  Welcome... we was expecting you...
                       (to Benjamin)
                  Could you show her upstairs?
                                (MORE)

                  She will be staying in Mrs.
                  Rousseau's old room. I'll be
                  right with you with some fresh
                  towels...
                       (frowning)
                  We don't usually let dogs in the
                  house.

                                THE WOMAN
                  He's as old as the hills. Blind
                  too. Can hardly get around, he
                  won't be a bother much longer.

     Benjamin, like any young boy, immediately pets the old
     dog...

                                QUEENIE
                  I guess as long as he stays out
                  from underfoot.

     Benjamin helps her with her bags showing her up the
     stairs...the old dog dutifully following them...

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm Benjamin...

     The woman starts to tell him her name... but we don't
     hear it because...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                       (after a beat)
                  As hard as I try, I can't remember
                  her name. Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs.
                  Hartford, or maybe it was Maple?
                  It's funny how sometimes the
                  people we remember the least, make
                  the greatest impression on us.

66   INT. THE OLDER WOMAN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1931     66

     Benjamin sits petting the dog while the Woman puts her
     things away...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I remember she wore diamonds...
                  and she always dressed in fine
                  clothing as if she was going out.
                  Although, she never did and nobody
                  would ever come to visit her.

                                                                    48.



67   INT. NOLAN HOUSE, PARLOR - VISITING DAY, 1931                  67

     We see the Woman dressed nicely, sitting in a chair
     reading a book. She takes a look out the window at the
     families on the lawn and bends back to her book.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               ...She taught me how to play the
               piano...

     The Woman sitting with Benjamin teaching him how to play
     piano...playing a classical piece like Chopin...Benjamin
     trying his hand...sounding pretty bad...

                             THE WOMAN
               It isn't how well you play, it's
               how you feel about what you're
               playing. (whispers) Try this.

     And she plays a ragtime piece...New Orleans music...music
     for the other whole part of the soul... Benjamin tries
     his hand and actually plays it fairly well

                             THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
               You cannot help but put your
               entire self into the music.

     And he plays along with her...a piece he won't soon
     forget...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               There were many changes going on,
               some you could see... some you
               couldn't.

69   INT. A BATHROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1932                     69

     We see Benjamin taking a bath. An he notices a single
     gray hair floating on the surface...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Hair, had started growing, in all
               sorts of places...

     And he sees some hair is under his arms... and as he
     looks downward...

                  I felt like I could do anything,
                  that I could sprout wings...

     And as he flexes his muscles, feeling like a man.

70   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT                  70

     It's started to rain, the wind blowing, splattering rain

                  I'll get the nurse...

     She hurries out of the room. Daisy looks out the window.
     The maelstrom of wind and rain. Caroline comes back with
     a Nurse.

                                THE NURSE
                  You're not feeling too good?

     She adjusts the morphine drip.      Daisy lays back.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  Nobody seems to know whether to
                  stay or leave. The roads are
                  filled from New Orleans to Baton
                  Rouge already. I think I'm gonna
                  ride it out.
                       (finishing with the
                        drip)
                  There, that should make things
                  easier.

     Daisy starts to feel the effects of the drip...

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                       (to Caroline)
                  Have you had a chance to say your
                  goodbyes?

     Caroline nods.    The Nurse nods.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  My father waited four hours for my
                  brother to get here from Boger
                  City. He couldn't go without him.

     She affectionately touches Daisy's cheek.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  She seems like a sweet woman.

     Caroline nods.

                                CAROLINE
                  I haven't spent as much time as I
                  would have like with her the last
                  few years.

     Another NURSE looks in...

                                THE WOMAN
                  You busy?

     The Nurse quickly   goes out of the room. Caroline sits
     back down looking   at her mother...Daisy opens her eyes...
     they look at each   other... Caroline knowing Daisy wants
     to hear the sound   of her voice...

     The busy docks... Men waiting, hoping to find work...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               These were hard times... people
               were doing anything they could to
               find work...

     And we see Benjamin, with Mr. Daws, "the lightning man,"
     sitting on a bench with a line of other old men, "killing
     time," watching the boats going up and down the River...

                             MR. DAWS
               Did I ever tell you I was struck
               by lightning seven times? Once,
               when I was in a field tending to
               my cows.

     And we see just that, Mr. Daws, along with a cow of his,
     being hit by lightning.

               Anybody want to make $2 for a
               day's work around here...

     Benjamin turns... And he sees a man in his late 40s with
     his three man crew, standing on the deck of a TUGBOAT,
     and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron... The man,
     its Captain MIKE... Has a thick Irish accent... For some
     reason none of the able-bodied men needing work
     respond...

               What's wrong, nobody wants to get

     And as Benjamin gets on the boat, heading out to sea...

72   EXT. TUGBOAT, MISSISSIPPI RIVER, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1932       72

     And we see Benjamin "learning the ropes..." Helping to
     tow the freighters, into and out of the River ports...
     Benjamin in this element, like a boy, his hair blowing,
     thrilled to be on the boat, thrilled by the adventure...
     willing to do anything...

                  Absolutely, damn right! So you

                  "What the hell you think you can
                  do?" I tell him. "Well if you
                  askin' -- I want to be a artist."
                  He laughs. He says, "If God
                  wanted you to be an artist he
                  would made you one." "God wanted
                  you to work a tugboat just like
                  me, and that's what you goin' to
                  do?" "Now, if I ever hear you
                  mention art again, I'll throw you
                  overboard!" Well, I went and I
                  show him... I made myself an
                  artist...

     And he suddenly takes off his shirt, pulls down his
     pants... And we see he's covered, from head to toe, with

               different! You got to do what you
               meant to do! And I happen to be a
               god-damned artist!

                             BENJAMIN
                    (stating the obvious)
               But you're a tugboat captain.

     Which stops Captain Mike in mid rant... And he has no
     answer for... His only response is to glare at
     Benjamin... A back door opens, a slinky woman coming
     in...

                             THE WOMAN
               Captain Mike, we're ready for you
               and your friend...

                             CAPT. MIKE
               Let's go old timer... Break your
               cherry... This one's on me...

     As they go...

                             CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                    (reconsidering)
               And here's you pay for today...
               Don't ever let anybody tell you
               Captain Mike didn't give a man
               what he deserved...

                             BENJAMIN
                    (looks at change he
                     was given)
               I thought it was $2 for a day's
               work...

                             CAPT. MIKE
               "you can't put a price on
               education..."

75   INT. WHORE HOUSE, THE QUARTER, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1932    75

     Captain Mike and Benjamin in a small parlor where girls,
     both black and white, are sitting around...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               It was a night to remember...

     Captain Mike knows just who he wants and moves off with
     her... Benjamin left standing, not knowing what to do...
     None of the women seem to anxious to be with the old
     man...

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                 ONE OF THE WOMEN
                   He gives me the willies...

                                 ONE OF THE WOMEN (CONT'D)
                   He's not for me, no ways...

      A thin Girl, maybe 19, of mixed ethnicity, decides to
      take a chance...

                                 THE GIRL
                   How are you tonight, Grandpa?

76    INT. A ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932         76

      And we see Benjamin and the girl sitting on a bed... And
      as she undresses him... First things first... tossing him
      a wash cloth...

                                 THE GIRL
                   Clean yourself up...

      He doesn't know what she means.. Taking the wash cloth he
      goes over to the sink and does what he knows how to do,
      wash his face...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Is that any better?

76A   INT. THE ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932       76A

      She's pushing him down, hiking up her skirt, all
      business...

                                 THE GIRL
                   Let's go... Time's a wastin'...

      She climbs on top of him... And instinct takes over...
      But Benjamin being just a boy... and this being the first
      time, his excitement gets the immediate best of him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Ohhh...!

                                 THE GIRL
                        (hopping up)
                   Come by anytime...

      She starts to leave... But Benjamin, who likes this an
      awful lot...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Again?

                   Again?

      She looks and sees, sure enough... She climbs back
      on...the results are virtually the same if a bit longer

                                 THE GIRL (CONT'D)
                   My hat's off to you old timer.

      She gets up to go...she's made it to the door... when
      Benjamin says...

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Again?

                                  THE GIRL
                   Again?

      She slows, turns to look... And sure enough... He's as
      ready as he's ever going to be... As she looks at him, a
      look bordering on amazement...

77    INT. THE ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932      77

                                 THE GIRL
                   What are you, Dick Tracy or
                   something? I've got to rest...

      And that's just what she's doing... trying to catch her
      breath...

                                 BENJAMIN

78    INT. PARLOR, WHORE HOUSE, THE QUARTER - LATER STILL, 1932     78

      And we see Benjamin, at the door, happily smiling...

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Thank you...

                   No, thank you...

      Benjamin, floating on air, hovering, never wants to
      leave...

                                 THE GIRL (CONT'D)
                   Have a nice night...

                  You'll be here tomorrow?

                                THE GIRL
                  Every night, but Sunday...

     And she's finally able to go...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  It sure made me understand the
                  value of earning a living... the
                  things it can buy you..

     Benjamin turns to leave... we hear footsteps... And we
     see a man, putting on a raincoat, coming downstairs from
     one of those other rooms... We see it's Benjamin's
     father... THOMAS BUTTON... Seeing Benjamin he slows...
     Benjamin, unaware of who he is, turns and goes out...

79   EXT. STREET, FRENCH QUARTER - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932              79

     It's a rainy night. Benjamin, feeling like a million
     bucks, walks along the street, going home... A
     chauffeured car pulls alongside him, the window rolled
     down... And we see Thomas Button in the car...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  It's awful wet out. Can I offer
                  you a ride somewhere...?

                                BENJAMIN
                  That's very kind of you, Sir.

     He gets into the car.

     They drive in awkward silence.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

                                  BENJAMIN

                  Benjamin... Yes, Benjamin... It's
                  a pleasure to know you.

     They shake hands.

     A small old bar. Benjamin and his father sitting in the

     age...

                                THE WAITER
                  What will it be sir?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'll have whatever he's having.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  A Sazerac for both of us...with
                  whiskey instead of brandy...

     The waiter leaves.

                                THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                  You don't drink do you?

                                BENJAMIN
                  It's a night for firsts...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  How is that?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I've never been to a whore house
                  either.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  It's an... experience...

                                 BENJAMIN
                  It certainly is.
                       (and honestly)
                  I'm not very experienced about a
                  lot of things.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  That isn't a bad thing.

                                BENJAMIN
                  There's a first time for
                  everything.

                  True enough. I don't mean to be
                  rude... but your hands seem awful
                  bent... It must be quite painful?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I don't really know what I have.
                  I have some form of a disease. I
                  have a lot of catching up to do.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  What kind of a disease?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I was born old.

     Thomas is quiet.    And for many things...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  I'm sorry.

                  No need to be. Nothing wrong with
                  old age.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  I'm sorry about your disease.

                                BENJAMIN
                  My mother says we're all born with

                  I'm adopted.

     Thomas looks at him... They get their drinks... Tap
     glasses, and drink. Benjamin coughs at the taste... But
     forces it down... And as they laugh at his discomfort...

     And there's a moment when it seems like Thomas might tell
     him, but despite the alcohol he thinks better of it...

                  Buttons. "Button's Buttons."
                  There isn't a button we don't
                  make. Our biggest competition is
                  B.F. Goodrich and his infernal
                  zippers...

                  If you'll let me pay for it, Mr.

               I enjoyed talking to you...

                             BENJAMIN
               I enjoyed drinking with you...

     He starts to wobble inside...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
                    (after him)
               Benjamin...

     Benjamin slows...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               Would you mind, if time to time, I
               stopped by to say hello...?

                             BENJAMIN
                    (a drunken wave)
               Anytime.

                             THOMAS BUTTON
                    (happily)
               Goodnight, Benjamin.

                             BENJAMIN
                    (drunkenly)
               Absolutely... Mr. Button...

     Benjamin turns inside. Thomas looks after him for a long
     moment... And then he drives away...

84   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1932                            84

     Benjamin holding the railing for support starts up the
     stairs for bed.

                             QUEENIE'S (V.O.)
               Where have you been!?

     And we see Queenie has been sitting in the front room...
     where she can see out the window...

                             BENJAMIN
               I listened to some music.... I --

     He doesn't mention the whore... But generically says...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                     63.

84   CONTINUED:                                                      84

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  I met some people.

     And right on cue Benjamin, wobbles...

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  I think mama... I'm going to...

     And to finish the evening, he throws up.

85   EXT. LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1934                      85

     The family's on the lawn...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I loved the weekends when she
                  would come and spend the night
                  with her grandmother.

86   INT. GRANDMA FULLER'S ROOM - DAWN, 1934                         86

     Daisy, nine now, asleep in bed with Grandma Fuller... We
     see Benjamin quietly enter... He gently nudges Daisy
     awake...

                                BENJAMIN
                       (whispers)
                  Do you want to see something?   We
                  have to keep it secret.

     Daisy, always willing, always brave, gets up...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                       (whispers)
                  Get dressed. I'll meet you behind
                  the kitchen...

     And he leaves the room as quickly as he came...

87   EXT. BEHIND THE KITCHEN - NOLAN HOUSE - DAWN, 1934              87

     Benjamin, in an old peacoat, holding another -- waits...
     Daisy comes out... as he stops the door from slamming...

                                BENJAMIN
                  Ssssh...
                       (whispers)
                  Can you swim?

                                DAISY
                  I can do anything you can do...

                                   BENJAMIN
                  Put this on...

     He gives her a heavy coat...she puts it on... It's two
     sizes too big for her...

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  We have to go fast...

     And she follows him between the houses... the two of them
     going quickly down the street...

88   EXT. THE DOCKS, MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAYBREAK, 1934             88

     Fog. The first light of dawn. A full compliment of
     boats tied up for the night... They scamper along the
     dock... to the "Chelsea" ...Benjamin helps her climb
     aboard...

89   INT. TUGBOAT, MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAYBREAK, 1934               89

     He goes downstairs to find -- Captain Mike sprawled
     across his bunk -- in all his naked tattooed glory, an
     empty bottle on the floor...

                                DAISY
                  What's wrong with him?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I think he has mejembe.
                       (shaking him)
                  Captain Mike... could you take us
                  out?

     Captain Mike opens one eye... sees them standing there...

                                CAPT. MIKE
                  You know what day it is?

                                   BENJAMIN
                  Sunday.

                                CAPT. MIKE
                  Do you know what dat mean?

     He doesn't.

                                CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                  It means I was very drunk last
                  night.

                                BENJAMIN
                  You're drunk every night.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                  Is that a girl?

                              BENJAMIN
               A close friend... I wanted to show
               her the River.

                             CAPT. MIKE
               I'm not supposed to be joy-ridin'
               with civilians... I could lose my
               license.

     That notion stops him for about a nanosecond.

                             CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                    (grabbing a bottle)
               What you standin' there for!

90   EXT. THE TUGBOAT, THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - EARLY, 1934       90

     The tugboat making its way through the fog... Benjamin
     standing with Daisy on the prow... the wind in their
     faces... And suddenly out of the fog a HORN BLARES... As
     loud as anything they have ever heard... and moving out
     of the mist, horn still echoing, a huge ocean liner
     appears... With three other tugboats pushing it to sea...

                             CAPT. MIKE
               She put in for repair... a wounded
               duck... She's flyin' now...

     Captain Mike joins the tugs at the liner's side... the
     tugs sounding horns of their own... a symphony of a
     kind... What interests Benjamin...

                             BENJAMIN
               What does it take to build
               something like that?

     Passengers line the railing... continuing their
     adventure... And what interests Daisy...

                             DAISY
               Imagine all the places they're
               going to see...

     Daisy, thrilled, waves to them -- the passengers along
     the rail, waving back... Benjamin stands by Daisy, their
     hair blowing in the salty air....

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
                    (to Benjamin)
               I wish we could go with them...

     As they watch the liner, like a foggy dream, sailing
     away...

                                                                  66.



91   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           91

     The rain and wind knocking at the window...

                             DAISY
                    (murmurs)
               I wish we could have...
                    (the morphine)

                             CAROLINE
               Did you say something, Mother?

     And there's a hint of anxiety in Caroline now... anxiety
     coupled with exhaustion... Daisy doesn't say anything.
     Caroline worriedly looks out the window.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               It seems to be getting worse.

     Daisy doesn't respond.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               Are you hearing me, mother?

                             DAISY
               Look at that... time just seeped
               out of me...

                               CAROLINE
               What?

                             DAISY
               Somebody will come and mop it up
               and that will be the end...

     Caroline can only listen... She takes a deep breath,
     gathering her strength...And when her mother's settled
     again...

                             CAROLINE
               Do you want me to go on reading?

     She murmurs, "Hmmm?" as if she didn't know Caroline had
     stopped. Caroline looks back down at the book.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               "Things were changing quickly."

92   INT. OLDER WOMAN'S ROOM   - NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY,       92

     Benjamin sitting in a straight back chair... getting a
     haircut... the dog at their feet... the VICTROLA, as
     usual, is working overtime...




                                                   (CONTINUED)

                             THE WOMAN
               I don't know how it's possible,
               you seem to have more hair...

                               BENJAMIN
                    (a   little arrogant)
               What if   I was to tell you I wasn't
               getting   older -- I was getting
               younger   than everybody else...

     And she then says, taking the wind out of his sails...

                             THE WOMAN
               Well, I'd feel very sorry for
               you... to have to see everybody
               you love, die before you.

     He's quiet, he hadn't thought of that...

                             THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
               That would be an awful
               responsibility...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I had never thought about life or
               death that way before...

     He's still... And seeing he's upset, she says the most
     beautiful of things...

                             THE WOMAN
               Benjamin... We're meant to lose
               the people we love. How else
               would we know how important they
               are to us.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               And one fall day... a familiar
               visitor came knocking on our
               door...

93   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1936                        93

     We see Benjamin knocking on the Woman's door...

                             BENJAMIN
               Would you like to go for a walk?

     There's no response. He opens it, going inside... The
     Woman is sitting in a chair by the window, the dog at her
     feet, the familiar Victrola playing dance music... He
     comes around the chair. And he sees she's still...
     perfectly still... her soul moved on...

                                                                  68.



94   EXT. CEMETERY PLOT, NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1936         94

     We see an old New Orleans paupers' cemetery... Benjamin
     and the mourners, and because he can't remember her name,
     around an unmarked grave...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               She had taught me how to play the
               piano.

     As Benjamin watches the woman go to her final rest.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               And she taught me what it meant to
               miss somebody.

95   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, ATTIC - NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1937        95

     We see Benjamin taking some things out of a dresser
     drawer, packing a suitcase...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I had gone to a whore house, I'd
               had my first drink, I had said
               goodbye to one friend and buried
               another... In 1937, when I was
               coming to end of the 17th year of
               my life, I packed by bag.

     We see him putting some final things into the suitcase,
     closing it...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...and said goodbye...

96   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1937            96

     We see Benjamin moving through the parlor, one by one,
     saying his good-byes to the old people...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I knew, life being what it was, I
               would probably never see them
               again...

     The familiar faces... And as we watch him affectionately
     touch or talk to each of them... we can just see out a
     screen window DAISY, almost thirteen now, leaning against
     the side of the house... Out of sight... as if she didn't
     say goodbye, he wouldn't leave...

                                                                    69.



97   EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1937                 97

     We see TIZZY on the porch holding Benjamin's suitcase for
     him... The woman's old dog lying beside him...

                             TIZZY
                    (shaking his hand)
               Good luck, son.

     And we see Queenie has come out onto the porch with her
     little girl... and he holds Queenie... tears running down
     her face...

                             BENJAMIN
               Goodbye, Mother...

     He bends to pet the old dog goodbye... He takes up his
     suitcase and starts off the porch... going down the
     walkway... he hesitates, and opens the gate... moving out
     onto the street... When suddenly Daisy is calling him...

               Benjamin... Benjamin...

     She comes running.   He stops to let her catch up to
     him...

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
               Where are you going?

                               BENJAMIN
               To sea.    I'll send you a postcard.

                             DAISY
               From everywhere. Write me a
               postcard from everywhere...

     And with so much she wants to say, she can't say
     anything. So she runs away... He watches her go,
     watchers her thin legs running back down the street...
     and he turns and moves off along the street...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               And I went off to sea...

     We see him in the distance, the "old man", a 17 year old,
     suitcase in hand, going to find out who he is and what he
     is to become...

     Caroline, not sure what she wants, opens a red velvet
     bag... she finds a wooden cigar box...

                  Of course.

     She gives her the box... Daisy, opens it... It's filled
     with postcards... Daisy, going through them...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)

                  Newfoundland... Baffin Bay...
                  Liverpool... Glasgow...Narvik...

     She takes one out, reading it... Taking up some others...
     looking... reading where they came from... reading off
     like an adventure...

     Daisy, the postcards, fond memories spread out on the bed
     around her...

                Captain Mike had contracted for
                three years with Moran Brothers
                Tug and Salvage... The old ship
                had been refitted with a diesel
                engine, and a new sea winch... We
                went around Florida and up the

      sitting with Captain Mike, their crew, and a mixture of
      other seamen, Russians and other ethnics, all speaking
      different languages, sitting and standing around tables
      cluttered with bottles and glasses... Captain Mike,
      drunk, his shirt off, is telling a Russian sailor,
      another interpreting for him -- about a tattoo he has
      over his heart... an upside down hummingbird...

                back in Singapore by Sakumoro, the
                greatest tattoo artist ever lived.
                I puts it on myself from mem'ry.

      And now we know why it's upside down...

                   languages, the color of their
                   skin, had one thing in common...
                   they were drunk every single
                   night...

      Then there's a shout -- and as if to underscore things,
      the Brody twins are kicking the shit out of each other
      again...

114   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941               114

      We see Benjamin waiting for the small caged elevator to
      take him to his room. He gets in, the elevator operator
      about to shut the grill door...

                                 A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                   Would you wait, please...

      And we see a WOMAN in her late 40s... getting on the
      elevator... Benjamin looks over at her...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her name was Elizabeth Abbott. She
                   was not beautiful. She was plain
                   as paper... But she was as pretty
                   as any picture to me...

      "Plain as paper," ELIZABETH ABBOTT... Directly behind her
      walks a tall, tired man, in his 50s... By the look of his
      ruddy face, and her silent mien... they're both drunk...
      Benjamin finds himself looking at her...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                   76.

114   CONTINUED:                                                  114

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   What are you looking at?

      She has a distinctly English accent. Benjamin doesn't say
      a word.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   If you must know, we have a long
                   standing agreement never to go to
                   bed sober. Isn't that right
                   darling?

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her husband was Walter Abbott...He
                   was Chief Minister of the British
                   Trade Mission in Murmansk... and
                   he was a spy...

      They ride up. Elizabeth has her shoes off...She sees him
      noting her stocking feet... The elevator finally rattles
      to a stop, and George and Elizabeth get off... Starting
      down the hall...she abruptly turns to say to Benjamin...
      so that it's completely understood...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I broke the heel off of one of my
                   shoes...I don't usually walk
                   around in my bare feet...

      And as he watches her saunter along the hallway... the
      way drunks do... endeavoring to keep her dignity...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   They were long days there...

115   EXT. MURMANSK HARBOR, RUSSIA - DAY, 1941                    115

      Benjamin on the tug, but it's less fun now, not much
      adventure, just hard work... Fighting the snow and the
      wind, they tow a large freighter into port...

                                                                  76A.



116   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM - "WINTER PALACE" - NIGHT, 1941        116

      Benjamin, in his small room, cold air blasting through
      the windows, looking out the window into the snowy
      night...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And longer nights...

      He lays on his bed looking out at the dark sky... the
      snow falling...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

116   CONTINUED:                                                     116

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   One particular night... when I was
                   having trouble sleeping...

117   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941                117

      Benjamin trudges down the stairs, stepping tentatively
      into the empty lobby... He slows, seeing ELIZABETH ABBOTT
      in her bathrobe, sitting, alone and lonely... and it's
      not the first time for her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm sorry... I can't sleep...

      She's quiet... She finally looks up... but doesn't say
      anything... There's an awkward moment...exacerbated by
      the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I was going to make some
                   tea...would you like some?

      She shakes her head no... He crosses through the empty
      bar, into an old KITCHEN... He looks for tea... Puts
      water in a kettle... As he watches the kettle boil...
      Elizabeth, her arms folded across her chest as if she
      were chilled, stands by the door... Benjamin, without
      asking, takes a cup for her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Milk...? Honey...?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Some honey, thank you.

      He finds a large honey jar... and seeing some dead flies
      in with the sweet syrup he asks...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Do you like flies with your tea?

      She smiles...for the first time... A thin smile... He
      starts to stir the tea... Elizabeth stopping him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You must let it steep for a
                   minute...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Steep?




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                       78.

117   CONTINUED:                                                      117

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Sit. There's a proper way to make
                   tea.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Where I'm from, they just want it
                   to be hot.

      She doesn't smile. He gives her a cup of tea... She
      cradles the cup... They're quiet, drinking their
      tea...two strangers... After some moments...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You're a seaman? I don't mean to
                   be rude...but aren't you rather
                   old to be working on a boat?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   There's no age limit... as long as
                   you can do the work...

      She nods... They're quiet again. She sits at an old wood
      counter.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You have trouble sleeping?

      It's an invitation to sit with her... He pulls a stool
      over sitting across from her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I didn't know I did... I usually
                   sleep like a baby. Something kept
                   me up.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I never sleep... Well, rarely
                   anyway...

      He doesn't say anything.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   My father, when he was in his
                   eighties, was so sure he was going
                   to die in his sleep... He would
                   only take naps during the
                   afternoon... so that death
                   couldn't catch him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Did he?



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                    79.

                               ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Did he what?

                              BENJAMIN
                Die in his sleep?

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                He died sitting in his favorite
                chair listening to his favorite
                program on the radio.

                              BENJAMIN
                     (smiles)
                He must have known something.

      She smiles at the idea... Another one... that goes as
      quickly as it's come... And it's quiet again...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                My husband's the British Trade
                Minister. We've been here fourteen
                months... We were supposed to be
                going to Peking... but it just
                never did work out. It never does
                seem to work out. Have you been to
                the Far East?

                              BENJAMIN
                I haven't really been anywhere. I
                mean outside different harbors.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Where are you from?

                              BENJAMIN
                New Orleans, Louisiana.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                     (pure Elizabeth)
                I didn't know there was another
                one.

      Which escapes him.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I've never been to America.
                Everywhere else. But not America.
                Am I missing anything?

                              BENJAMIN
                     (simply, guileless)
                The Mississippi River.

                And she told me all the places she
                had been, and what she had seen...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                I can tell you what bars look like
                in places all over the world...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And we talked until just before
                the dawn...

118   INT. KITCHEN, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - DAYBREAK, 1941       118

      The first hint of daylight...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Thank you for the tea...

      She leaves as quietly as she entered... Benjamin remains
      standing for a moment...then shuts the light off behind
      him.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                ...And we went back to our
                rooms... to our separate lives...

      And as he goes back up the quiet stairs...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And every night... we would meet
                in the middle Of the night...

119   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941 119

      Benjamin padding downstairs... slowing... happy to see
      Elizabeth, in her bathrobe, sitting in the empty lobby,
      waiting for him...

120   INT. KITCHEN, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - BEFORE DAWN, 1941 120

      Elizabeth and Benjamin quietly talking...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                A hotel in the middle of the night
                can be a magical place...

      And we see the empty front desk and tiny silver bell...
      The vacant lobby, with its musty old rugs... The open
      elevator, waiting... The dining room, with its crisp
      white tablecloths.

                   A radiator hissing. A sink
                   dripping. A floor creaking. A
                   curtain blowing.

      We see and hear it all... All the little sounds, a
      symphony, that make up life in a hotel in the middle of
      the night... Benjamin and Elizabeth sitting quietly
      drinking their tea.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   There is something peaceful, even
                   comforting, knowing that people
                   you love are asleep in their beds,
                   where nothing can harm them...

121   INT. VARIOUS BEDROOMS - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941                    121

      Queenie and Tizzy asleep together in her bed... Their
      child on the floor... The old people in their beds in the
      old house. Ngunda Oti asleep in a room somewhere. The
      unnamed woman's grave. A different kind of sleep. And of
      course Daisy, in a New York apartment loft with other
      dancers... sleeping peacefully.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Elizabeth and I would talk through

                   You must think I don't love my

                   Why do you say that?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Married women don't usually sit
                   with strange men in a hotel in the
                   middle of the night. I certainly
                   don't.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (honestly)
                   I don't know what married women do
                   or don't do.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Let's get one thing straight. I
                   love him very much. I happen to
                   think he is one of the smartest
                   and most considerate men I ever
                   met. It is not his fault I decided
                   to spend my life in his shadow.

      And with that she gets up and leaves... Benjamin, left
      with that thought...

123   INT. DINING ROOM, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941         123

      Benjamin and Elizabeth in the empty dining room at a
      table with a white tablecloth... with some wine and
      cheese... She's laughing now, measurably loosened up...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   He started to take his pants
                   off... I'm afraid he misread me
                   completely...

      He laughs. She looks through her wine glass at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Do you notice how people look
                   better through a wine glass...

      He holds his up.... looking at her....She moves her glass
      just looking at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You're a good looking man with or
                   without a wine glass...

      She picks at the tablecloth with her finger next to
      his... She puts her finger over his making a cross...



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                   83.

123   CONTINUED:                                                  123

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   We are all just crossing in the
                   night. Sometimes we intersect.

      She leaves her finger there for a moment... lingering...
      She abruptly moves it away...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   I should go to bed... he'll be up
                   soon.

      She hesitates... And she kisses him, and then hurries out
      of the dining room... As Benjamin sits in the empty
      dining room... the kiss left on his lips...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It was the first time a woman had
                   ever kissed me. It's something you
                   never forget.

124   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT          124

      The wind and rain knocking at the window. Daisy silently
      lying in bed.

                                 CAROLINE
                   Are you upset, Mother?

      She doesn't say anything. Caroline, seeing her feet have
      come out of the covers, caring, fixes her blanket.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Would you like some socks?

      Daisy's quiet.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Do you want me to stop reading?

      Daisy's answer for her is...

                                 DAISY
                   It must have been very cold. I'm
                   glad he had somebody to keep him
                   warm.

      Which Caroline takes as her cue to read on...

                                 CAROLINE
                        (after a beat,
                         reading)
                   "I couldn't wait to see her
                   again."

                                                                  83A.



125   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER LATE NIGHT, 1941     125

      Benjamin comes hurrying down the stairs. Elizabeth is
      waiting, as she normally is, but this time she is
      dressed... Lipstick and hair done... wearing a fur.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (self-conscious)
                   I'm not dressed --

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You're delicious just as you
                   are...

      She laughs, taking his arm, walking to the dining room as
      if going to dinner... They sit at a table... which she
      has set for them... Caviar and Vodka...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Don't bother with the cheese or
                   the wine here, they're quite
                   common... but the caviar and the
                   vodka are plentiful and sublime...

      She feeds him a spoonful of the caviar...Unaccustomed to
      it, he swallows it too quickly...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Take your time... If you eat it
                   all at once there will be nothing
                   left to enjoy... savor it...

      She gives him another spoonful... and takes one
      herself... He takes his time... They both do... savoring
      it...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                        (pouring)
                   Now, a swallow of vodka...

      Which they do... She laughs... Looking at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You haven't been with many women
                   have you?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   No. Not many. At least none on a
                   Sunday.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                        (smiles)
                   I feel like I'm with a virgin.

      She's not far off... And it's a lovely thought... and it
      makes her think of her youth.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                When I was nineteen, I tried to
                become the first woman to swim the
                English Channel...

126   EXT. THE ENGLISH CHANNEL ­ DAY, 1911                        126

      And we see just that....Young Elizabeth, in goggles, her
      body covered with grease, swimming with two escort boats
      across the English Channel.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                The current was so strong...that
                for every stroke I took... I was
                pushed two strokes back...

      And we see just that, Elizabeth fighting the current...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                I swam for 32 hours... I was only
                two miles from the French shore...

      Elizabeth in sight of the lights of Calais...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                When it started to rain...

      And it starts to rain on her... Harder and harder... the
      shore is suddenly gone from sight...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                When I couldn't go any further,
                and I just stopped...

      And we see her being taken onto a boat, a blanket wrapped
      around her...

127   EXT. CALAIS, BEACH - NIGHT, 1911                            127

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                They asked me whether I would try
                again...?

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Why wouldn't I?

      She smiles, a young girl, full of life...

                                                                   86.



128   INT. DINING ROOM - "WINTER PALACE" - LATE NIGHT, 1941        128

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                I never did. As a matter of fact,
                I have never done much of anything
                with my life after that...

      And it's quiet. She touches his rough hand.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                Your hands are very rough... you
                have grease under your nails...

      She runs her fingernail along his face...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I can feel the wind on your
                face...

      They look at each other. And this time, Benjamin kisses
      her. It lingers... She stops herself...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I'm afraid it's the witching
                hour...

      She quickly gets up... And she's gone. As Benjamin sits
      in the empty dining room.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                It took me a long time to go to
                sleep.

129   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER LATE NIGHT, 1941      129

      We see Elizabeth nicely dressed, a bottle of champagne in
      her hand, sitting anxiously waiting. The elevator doors
      open. Benjamin in a suit and tie, as handsome as we've
      seen him steps out. She stands, takes his arm.

                              BENJAMIN
                Do I look okay? I borrowed it from
                one of the men. It's his church
                suit.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                You take my breath away.

      She walks with him, champagne bottle in hand, through the
      empty lobby...

                   The thing about clothing is, it
                   should make you feel comfortable,
                   then you will be comfortable...
                   Come, let's take a walk...

130   EXT. MURMANSK, RUSSIA - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941                    130

      Their arms in each other's, their breath showing in the
      night, they walk through the sleeping Russian town, their
      shadows in the moonlight. They stop to share a drink from
      the champagne bottle. They laugh.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I feel so much younger when I'm
                   with you...

      And it seems he's about to go on... But Elizabeth,
      flattered, takes it metaphorically...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   That's such a nice thing to say.
                   You make me feel years younger,
                   too. I wish I was. I would
                   change so many things. I would
                   undo all of my mistakes.

                                    BENJAMIN
                   What mistakes?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I kept waiting, thinking I would
                   do something to change my
                   circumstance... Do something...
                   But I never did... It's an awful
                   waste, you can never get it
                   back... wasted time...

      They're quiet.    She looks at him.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                        (abruptly)
                   If we're going to have an affair,
                   you're never to look at me during
                   the day, we must always part by
                   sunrise, and we can never say "I
                   love you..."

      He's quiet...

                   And when it is over I will send
                   you a card that will simply say
                   goodbye... Those are the rules...

      They stand in the cold. His answer is...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Are you as cold as I am?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                        (laughs)
                   My god, colder.

      They stop to finish what's left of the champagne,
      Elizabeth hurling the bottle. The bottle falling silently
      into some fresh snow.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You can't even break a bottle
                   here.

      They look at each other and they kiss. And without
      anything else needing to be said, they start back...

                   Get a key.

      Benjamin goes behind the registration desk, taking an
      empty room key off a hook... They cross to the
      elevator...

132   INT. ELEVATOR, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941 132

      They stand in the elevator as it ascends. Anticipating
      what's to come...

133   INT. HALLWAY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941    133

      They move along a dark hallway. He quietly unlocks an
      empty room door... And as he follows her into the room...
      the door closing.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She was the first woman who ever
                   loved me.

134   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER DAY, 1941            134

      Benjamin, in his peacoat, and stocking cap, snow on him,
      hurries into the hotel from work... He runs to the
      elevator, the doors just closing.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Hold it...

      It opens. He goes inside.      And Elizabeth's husband is
      standing in the elevator.

135   INT. ELEVATOR, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE DAY, 1941     135

      They silently ride up, not a word exchanged. The
      elevator stops. Elizabeth's husband gets out. As he
      quietly walks down the hall...

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   We saw each other every night...
                   we always used the same room...

136   INT. HALL "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT TO DAWN, 1941     136

      We see the key going into the door... Benjamin and
      Elizabeth going inside closing the door behind them...
      leaving us with the quiet hallway.

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   But each time seemed new and
                   different...

      And we see them as dawn creeps along the hallway,
      Benjamin and Elizabeth, leaving the room, not wanting to
      part, passionately kissing, and as they start to go their
      separate ways...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (whispering)
                   Elizabeth...

      She turns.

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        (whispers)
                   You should swim the English
                   channel again.

      And as she laughs to herself and hurries off...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Until one night...

                                                                   90.



137   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1941           137

      We see Benjamin coming down the stairs, into the lobby to
      meet Elizabeth. And he slows...Elizabeth isn't there. He
      looks into the bar...the kitchen....the dining room... He
      goes back to the lobby, sitting on a lone sofa, waiting
      for her... A mouse runs across the marble floor, stops,
      looks at him and runs off... And he sits and waits.

138   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - EARLY MORNING, 1941 138

      Snow shrouds the windows. We see Benjamin has fallen
      asleep on the sofa... There's the distinctive BELLOW of
      Captain Mike's VOICE. Benjamin wakes... He follows the
      bellowing to find Captain Mike with the tugboat CREW in
      the bar...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Roosevelt says we all got to do
                our part! After them Japs
                attacked Pearl Harbor everyone's
                got to! The Chelsea's been
                commissioned to serve in the
                United States Navy, to repair,
                tow, salvage and rescue... Anybody
                don't want to go to war, now's the
                time to say so... Once you set
                foot on that boat again, you're in
                the Navy friend!

                              BENJAMIN
                     (right away)
                I'll go captain!

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Easy old timer.
                     (to the men)
                I'll hold it against no man. But
                speak up now or forever hold your
                water.

      And the Cook, Prentis Mayes...

                              THE COOK
                I was planning on talking to you
                Cap'n Mike... My wife's doing
                poorly. I'd like to see her one
                more time...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                     (understanding)
                You're free to get home any way
                you can Mr. Mayes.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                       91.

138   CONTINUED:                                                      138

      And the cook walks off.

                                 JOHN GRIMM
                        (always dour)
                   Who do you intend to have cook
                   then? One of the leading causes
                   of death at sea is food poisoning,
                   right after inadequate safety
                   equipment.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I grew up cooking, sir. I'll take
                   the job, if I'm not too old to
                   serve.

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   You a real Johnny on the Spot,
                   Benjamin. I'll take any able
                   bodied mens who wants kick shit
                   out of the Japs and the Huns.

      And with no one dissenting...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Then that's it! We's goin' to
                   war, gentlemen!

      And filled with fervor, they give a cheer.

139   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, "WINTER PALACE" LATER, 1941               139

      Benjamin unlocking the door to his room. An ENVELOPE has
      been left under the door, he opens it.

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   She had left a note. She wrote,
                   "it was nice to have met you."
                   That was it.

      And as he stands holding the letter in his room at the
      small Russian hotel:

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And so, I went to war.

140   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN, SOMEWHERE - NIGHT, 1941           140

      The men on the tug on a dark gray sea....

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It wasn't the war we expected. We
                   would tow crippled ships... scraps
                   of metal...
                                 (MORE)

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   across the high seas... If there
                   was a war, we didn't see it...

      And what seemed exciting, the idea of war... is
      tedious... The "Chelsea" towing a strange hulking shape
      on the dark, empty sea...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   There was a man assigned with
                   us... The Chief Gunner loved the
                   Navy, and most of all, he loved
                   America.

                                 THE MAN'S (V.O.)
                   There is no other country in the
                   world...! When YOU spell America,
                   A.M.E.R.I.C.A. You're spelling
                   freedom...!

      We see the young Gunnery Mate, no more than nineteen...
      sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun...
      ready to kick some enemy ass...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   His name was Dennis Smith and he
                   was a full blooded Cherokee... His
                   family had been in America for
                   over five hundred years.

                                 DENNIS SMITH
                   You have these pacifists. They
                   say they won't fight on
                   conscience. Where would we be if
                   everybody decided to act according
                   to their conscience?

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                        (out his Window)
                   Keeps it down, would you chief!

      He goes back inside... And as they settle into their
      tasks..

                                 DENNIS SMITH
                        (on his gun, to
                         himself, the last
                         word)
                   Where else can you shoot white
                   people and get away with it...

      Benjamin's the only one around to hear him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I worked in the kitchen...

                                                                   93.



141   INT. THE TUGBOAT KITCHEN - DAY, 1941                         141

      Benjamin busy preparing a meal in the galley kitchen. The
      Perpetually silent Pleasant Curtis, on kitchen duty,
      helping him with the preparation... while they work...

                              BENJAMIN
                     (trying to make
                      conversation)
                You're from the Kentucky mountains
                aren't you? It must be pretty
                there..

      Pleasant Curtis doesn't say a word. Benjamin shrugging,
      puts the pie in an oven.

142   INT. THE GALLEY - TUGBOAT - NIGHT                            142

      The men; including Dennis Smith, Pleasant Curtis, John
      Grimm, the "fighting" Brody twins, Benjamin serving them,
      silently eating dinner, rolling with endless rolling
      Ocean. Pleasant, not interested, just gets up and leaves.

                              JOHN GRIMM
                There's something not normal about
                him.

      As they silently eat, mostly bored...

                              DENNIS SMITH
                     (looking outside)
                Whoever said "War is hell,"
                doesn't know shit from shinola.

143   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN -- ANOTHER NIGHT, 1942          143

      We see "Chelsea," a steel tow line splayed out from its
      winch, towing a large crippled freighter across the
      ocean...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We were towing a British
                freighter, that had gone dead in
                the water, 800 miles to Halifax
                for repair...

      We see Benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow
      line run out some thousand feet behind them...

144   INT. CREW QUARTER, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942     144

      We see Benjamin awake in his bunk, Dennis Smith asleep in
      the bunk above him.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

144   CONTINUED:                                                     144

      Pleasant Curtis seemingly asleep in his bunk below him...
      Benjamin looking out at the black sea... and out of the
      silence Pleasant Curtis for the first time speaks...

                                  PLEASANT CURTIS
                   I've been watching you. You seem
                   trustworthy. If something happens
                   to me... could you see this gets
                   to my wife...?

      He hands Benjamin a folded up handkerchief...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   He had given me all of his pay...
                   he hadn't spent a dime of it...

                                 PLEASANT CURTIS
                   If anything happens I want my
                   family to know I was thinking
                   about them, and if I could have,
                   I'd have come back home.

      And that said he turns back over... And as Benjamin looks
      at the dark foreboding sea... suddenly:

                                 CAPT. MIKE (OVER)
                        (calls)
                   All hands on deck!!!

      They bolt from their bunks... Going outside...

145   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     145

      Captain Mike stands by the wheelhouse... silently looking
      at the ocean... They see bodies of men, dead men,
      floating by them... One and two at first... then three
      and four... and then more and more until they are moving
      through a carpet of bodies...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   The war found us.

      As they move through the water... their propeller
      literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to
      veritably shut their engines down...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   A transport carrying 900 men had
                   been hit by a torpedo. We were
                   first to arrive at the scene...

      And as the tug arrives at the scene we see a TRANSPORT
      VESSEL, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking
      quickly... Fuel oil burning on the water...
                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                       95.

145   CONTINUED:                                                      145

      It's then we see the true horror of the men in the
      water... in the burning black oil... The transport boat
      silently slips into the water, disappearing under the
      sea...

146   EXT. TUGBOAT - ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     146

      As the tug moves through the thick black smoke...
      Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the
      rails...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   There wasn't a sound...

      Except for the   lapping of water, and the tugboat's
      engines, there   isn't... just the silence of death...
      Something else   appears, doming onto the surface like a
      spectre... the   U-BOAT that had reeked this havoc...
      looking to see   the results... Captain Mike sees the
      sub...

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                        (mad as hell)
                   We can't run from the fucker and
                   we can't hide...! There's only one
                   thing we can do...!
                        (and he shouts)
                   Battle Stations...!!!

      They run to their battle stations...

147   INT. PILOT HOUSE, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942         147

      Captain Mike at the wheel in the pilot house, turning the
      tug, furiously bearing down on the surfaced submarine...

148   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                      148

      A German submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the
      Tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the
      tugboat... Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead
      cut open, bleeding... Despite the strafing the tug is
      relentless... The submarine, seeing it is about to be
      rammed tries to dive... but it's too late... the tugboat
      ramming the submarine... severing the U-Boat in half. The
      concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in
      the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo
      exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process,
      blasting away under the stern of the tugboat... the men
      on the stern blown to pieces... Benjamin's literally
      thrown against the wheel house... He manages to get to
      his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink... There's a
      man's voice...

      And he sees, Captain Mike riddled with bullets, his body
      covered with blood... Benjamin bends to him... Captain
      Mike trembling as he lays dying...

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   Look at what they did! They shot
                   holes in me! They shots the hell
                   out my paintin'!

      His body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is
      riddled...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   You've seen a lot of things. Tell
                   me it's going to be alright.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're going to heaven Captain
                   Mike. You're going to heaven.

      Benjamin sits beside him, his friend Captain Mike, dying.
      And a light comes in Captain Mike's eyes... an
      understanding.

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   You can be mad as a mad dawg at
                   the way things wents... You can
                   swear, curse the fates, regret
                   every'ting you ever dids... but
                   when it comes to the end... You
                   have to lets go...

      He looks in Benjamin's old eyes....

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Give me a hand, old man...

      And as he holds Benjamin's hand ready to meet his
      maker...

149   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - LATE AFTERNOON, 1942            149

      There are two destroyers and a hospital ship in the
      battle zone flow... Planes circling... The water still
      speckled with debris, and bodies...

150   EXT. A LIBERTY SHIP, THE NORTH ATLANTIC - DUSK, 1942           150

      We see Benjamin at the railing of a Liberty Ship.. He
      watches the "Chelsea" sink, disappearing under the sea...

                   736 men died that day... I said my
                   goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis
                   Smith, John Grimm who was right,
                   he was going to die there... I
                   sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his
                   money... I said goodbye to the
                   twin, Vic Brody...

      He instinctively turns, and sees Rick Brody looking out a
      porthole, lost without his twin brother...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   And to Mike Clark... Captain of
                   the tugboat "Chelsea."

      A storage cabinet is opened, a sailor taking out a
      wreath, from a supply of just such wreaths...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You mind...

      The Sailor shrugs, giving him the wreath...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I said goodbye to all the other
                   men... who had dreams of their
                   own... All the men who wanted to
                   be plumbers or singers or
                   insurance salesmen or doctors...
                   or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

      And suddenly, angrily, he throws the wreath into the
      water...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Out here, death didn't seem
                   normal.

      Benjamin standing at the rail of the ship... no longer a
      boy... And a SAILOR standing beside him....

                                 THE SAILOR
                   This don't get fixed...

      Benjamin's quiet. When suddenly a HUMMINGBIRD comes
      flying across the water... It circles the wreath, the way
      Hummingbirds do... and then flies off...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   ...I'd never seen a hummingbird

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                In the spring of 1945.... when I
                was 26 years old... I went home...

151   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT, 1945            151

      We see Benjamin, suitcase in hand, going up the walk to
      the old house. We're struck by the difference... the old
      man who had left to see the world has returned a
      strikingly handsome man in his fifties. The old blind
      dog, smelling ham, ambles off the porch to meet him.
      Nothing seems to have changed. An old woman we don't
      know is rocking on the porch. A black girl, just 14... is
      hanging out wash...

                              BENJAMIN
                Is your mother home?

                              THE GIRL
                She's gettin' supper ready....

      He goes up the porch, inside....

152   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT, 1945            152

      Some old folks are in the front room... Nobody we know...
      He moves by them into the kitchen... the stovetop smoking
      and gurgling... He goes into the dining room... Queenie
      is busy setting the table... He watches her for a
      moment...

                              BENJAMIN
                     (quietly)
                Queenie...

      She turns, seeing him... she drops a plate...

                              QUEENIE
                Lord have mercy....you're home...

      She runs to embrace him... We see she's aged... the eight
      years he's been gone... and the 25 years or so since
      we've known her... now in her fifties...

                              THE GIRL'S (V.0.)
                     (asks)
                Who is that mama?

      The Girl comes inside... curious...

                                 QUEENIE
                   Your brother, Benjamin...

                                 THE GIRL
                   I didn't know he was my brother.

                                 QUEENIE
                        (laughs)
                   There's a shit load of things you
                   don't know...

      But her interest is in Benjamin....

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                        (studying him)
                   You look like you've been born
                   again... you're younger than the
                   springtime... I think that
                   preacher laid the hands on you
                   brought you a second life... I
                   knew the moment I saw you -- you
                   were special... Every night I got
                   on my knees asking the Good Lord
                   to bring you back safely. Remember
                   what I told you...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You never know what's comin' for
                   you.

      And they both share a good laugh at her homily... glad to
      be together once again.

                                 QUEENIE
                   Did you learn anything worth
                   repeating?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I saw a lot of things.

      She touches the scar, from the bullet, on his forehead.

                                 QUEENIE
                   You seen some pain.

      He nods.

                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                   Some joy too?

      He nods, that too. And she holds him again.

                Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one
                night last April. He's sleeping
                comfortably now in the cemetery on
                St. James street, God rest his
                soul...

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm so sorry...

      She turns from him so as not to cry....

                              QUEENIE
                There's only one or two of them
                left now... They all just about
                new... waitin' their turn like
                everybody else... I am so glad to
                have I you back. Now we got to
                find you some proper work and get
                you married right...

      Benjamin sitting with a row of oldsters. And feeling out
      of place, out of time, he gets up and goes inside.

154   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER, 1945                 154

      We see Benjamin playing the piano in the parlor, the
      particular tune the Woman had taught him... an old man
      sitting nearby, seemingly listening... Queenie, looking
      in...

                              QUEENIE
                You're wasting your time... he's
                stone deaf... You'll be staying in
                what was Mrs. DeSeroux's room now,
                you're too much of a man to stay
                in the attic anymore.

      She goes about her business... And as Benjamin goes back
      to playing the piano for the deaf man... playing for
      himself...

155   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1945                    155

      We see Mr. Daws, much older now, asleep in an easy chair.

                   It's a funny thing about coming
                   home. Smells the same. Looks the
                   same. Feels the same.

      Mr. Daws awakens.    Seeing Benjamin.   As if he never left.

                                 MR. DAWS
                   Did I ever tell you I've been
                   struck by lightning seven times.
                   Once I was sitting in my truck
                   listening to the radio.

      And we see just that Mr. Daws sitting in his truck
      getting belted by lightning.

                   had been back...

156   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ONE EVENING, 1945                 156

      We see Benjamin, coming down the stairs. He happens to
      glance out a casement window... He slows... He can just
      see part of a TAXI coming to stop at the gate. He moves
      to the next landing...where he can see a figure is
      getting out of the cab... The figure of a young woman,
      wearing a beret, a dark coat and lace up boots... She
      strides through the gate... It takes us a moment to
      recognize her... the leggy thirteen year old girl is
      gone... replaced by a confident woman in her early
      twenties... with her red hair and her blue eyes she could
      be no one else but DAISY. Benjamin follows her progress,
      moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened
      windows... She moves gracefully past the porch with its
      swings... The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her,
      comes to greet her... Daisy going around to the back of
      the house... Benjamin moving to the back door, and just
      as Daisy starts to knock... Benjamin opening it...
      Momentarily startled, she doesn't recognize him.... and
      asks...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Daisy... it's me, Benjamin.

      She hardly can believe her eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   Benjamin...Oh my God it's you...
                   Of course it's you...

      They embrace, and there's a moment when the touch is not
      just of old friends, but something different... and they
      both, in that moment recognize that things will never be
      the same... Daisy, over-hugging him... the way young
      people do...

                                  DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin, how are you? It's been
                   such a long time... There's so
                   much I want to know... When did
                   you come back?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Just a few weeks ago...

                   I spoke to Queenie...she told me
                   you were in the war...somewhere at
                   sea... I was so worried about
                   you...

                                   BENJAMIN
                        (simply)
                   I'm okay.

                   When I had left she was a girl...
                   and a woman had taken her place...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I can't get over you -- You are so
                   lovely...

                                 DAISY
                   You stopped writing.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I feel terrible about it...

                Now that I see you I feel even
                worse... Look at you...Daisy
                Fuller...

157   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT             157

      Daisy's still. She touches her old face.

                                DAISY
                ...Beautiful.

      Benjamin and Daisy going up the back stairs...

                I can't get over you're home...
                I've been planning to come by for
                awhile... my grandmother, you
                remember Grandma Fuller... of
                course you remember her... she
                passed away...

                              BENJAMIN
                I heard that... I'm sorry...

                              DAISY
                I've been wanting to get some of
                her things...

      ...They go into her grandmother's room...

159   INT. GRANDMA FULLER'S ROOM - TWILIGHT, 1945                    159

      Her grandmother's things are in boxes neatly stacked in a
      corner, waiting to be taken away... Daisy starts to go
      through them... Benjamin gives her a hand... As they go
      through things...

                   I can't believe I open the door,
                   and you're actually standing
                   there...It must be fate... What do
                   they call it, "Kismet"? I read a
                   book about a man named Edgar
                   Cayce, a psychic, everything is
                   predetermined...I like to think
                   it's fate. What do you think,
                   Benjamin?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't know how it works, but I'm
                   sure glad it happened...

      They inadvertently touch... the electricity of
      friction... both aware of the closeness... they move ever
      so slightly apart...

                   just across the bridge from me...
                   I can actually see the Empire
                   State Building if I stand on my
                   bed... Where have you been? Tell
                   me everything. The last time you
                   wrote you said you were in Russia?
                   I always wanted to go to Russia...
                   Is it as cold as they say...? You
                   wrote you met somebody... did it
                   work out...?

                                  BENJAMIN
                        (holding out)
                   Remember this?

      He's comes upon the BOOK her grandmother had read to
      them, Rudyard Kipling's "Just So." She sits on the bed...
      Benjamin sitting beside her... the two shoulder to
      shoulder... Daisy looking through the book... and
      reading....

                                 DAISY
                   ...This is the picture of Old Man

      She looks at him.

                You don't look like an old man
                anymore...You always said you were
                different... I think you must
                be...

      He doesn't say anything. The two of them sitting with
      their backs to us like the old friends they are...They
      touch... acutely aware of their proximity and before it
      can go any further...

                              BENJAMIN
                Are you hungry? Would you like to
                get something to eat?

                              DAISY
                I would love that...

      And the moment's gone...

160   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT                           160

      ...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion...
      and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man
      helping her... and we see Benjamin a step behind getting
      out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked,
      elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... And we hear
      Daisy's voice, from somewhere else...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                ...I danced for a man named
                Ballenchine...He's a famous
                choreographer. He said I had a
                perfect line. They asked
                Ballenchine to describe what he
                did. He said, "I'm a carpenter."
                Isn't that amazing? In one of his
                rehearsals a dancer fell. He put
                it into the production. Can you
                imagine that in a classical
                ballet? A dancer intentionally
                falling? He isn't the only one,
                Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein,
                Richard Pleasant, Lucia
                Chase...There's a whole new word
                for dance now, it's called
                abstract..."

      The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy... another
      man showing her inside... Benjamin forgotten for the
      slightest of moments at the door... going after her.

                                                                   106.



161   INT. NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT, 1945                    161

      A crowded New Orleans restaurant. Daisy as a maitre d in
      slow motion is showing her to a table... Men's, and even
      women's, eyes following her...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                ...They have torn up all the
                conventions... the straight up and
                down style, all the things that
                bound dancers...It's not about the
                formality of the dance...the
                classical structure...it's about
                what the dancer's feeling...there
                are no rules; the movement can be
                tense or relaxed, abrupt or
                flowing, carefree or somber, it
                may suggest love or hate,
                attraction or repulsion. The
                unexpected shifts of weight or
                energy -- not just to shock but to
                reinvent tradition...putting the
                familiar form to new and
                unexpected uses. It's so basic
                Just you alone with your body...

      They reach a table... A chair in slow motion swept out
      for her to sit... another man in slow motion putting a
      napkin in her lap...

                              DAISY (V.O)
                They understand America's vigor
                and physicality -- they understand
                the freshness of the American
                people at their most modern, at
                their best.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                And she told me about this world
                that she was so attracted to...
                names that didn't mean a thing to
                me...I didn't really hear very
                much of what she was saying.

      We watch them at the table... Benjamin listening,
      appreciating her... her face aglow with the intensity and
      the passion of youth... Caviar is brought over...
      vodka... She screws up her mouth not wanting to eat... We
      can sense he's telling her, what he's learned from
      Elizabeth Abbott, how to savor it... He feeds her a
      spoonful... They drink the vodka washing it down... she
      laughs, delighted... And we now hear what she is
      saying...

                   Oh my god, I've been just talking

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm enjoying listening...

      She takes out a cigarette... He instinctively looks for
      matches, a man gets there first, lighting her cigarette
      for her... he watches the smoke curl around her...
      appreciating her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I didn't know you smoked...

162   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS PARK - NIGHT                                 162

      We see Benjamin and Daisy, their silhouettes walking
      through the park... She puts her arm around his
      shoulder... being close to him...

                                 DAISY
                   I have to go back tomorrow... I
                   wish I could stay...

      They reach a GAZEBO... Not a soul around... They stand
      for a moment in the silence...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   In New York we stay up all
                   night... I eat breakfast in a
                   diner on Houston with red booths
                   and watch the sun come up over the
                   buildings... there's always
                   something to do...

      Which is in stark contrast to Benjamin's life... Daisy,
      takes off her shoes...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Dancers... don't need costumes or
                   scenery.

      And showing him what she's been telling him about, she
      does a dance for him...

                   books were banned... The words are
                   like making love....

      He stands, hands in his pockets appreciating her... she
      moves closer to him... She comes next to him and she
      kisses him... and when he doesn't respond... she tries a
      different tact...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   In our group... you have to trust
                   people... not be afraid... Sex...
                   is a big part of it... A lot of
                   the dancers... are lesbians... A
                   woman wanted me to sleep with
                   her....

      He's quiet.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Does that upset you?

                   That someone wanted to sleep with
                   me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   People should want to sleep with
                   you... You're very desirable...

                   get a room somewhere... we can put
                   down your coat...

      She takes his hand, as if to lead him to the dark of the
      park... There's nothing he'd like more... but...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   It's not that I don't want to... I

                Do you think you are too old for
                me... I've been with older men...

      And when he still doesn't respond...   Daisy, rejected,
      takes up her shoes... And she starts   off... Benjamin
      coming beside her... but they're not   really walking
      together anymore... and the time for   them, this time, has
      gone away...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                You only get so many chances to be
                with someone... I let her go...
                and I missed it...

163   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT            163

      Daisy, caught in the distant time...

                              DAISY
                You look so handsome in that
                suit... your hair...

      A Nurse looks in...

                              THE NURSE
                They're sayin' the hurricane's
                going to miss us... blow right on
                by...

                              CAROLINE
                Oh, that's great.

      The Nurse goes off down the hall, her voice telling
      people the good news...

                   Isn't that good news, Mother?

      But Daisy is in still another place and another time...

                                    DAISY
                   Good news?

                                    CAROLINE
                   The hurricane.     It is going to
                   miss us.

                                 DAISY
                   I'll just stay under the blankets
                   with my mother. She said nothing
                   would happen to me.

      She looks at the book.

                                    DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin?

                   Would you like me to keep reading?

      Daisy nods.

                   He said, "Things were becoming
                   different for me..."

164   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1945                 164

      Benjamin lying on his bed, his glasses on, reading...
      "D.H. Lawrence"... We see he's squinting... We see his
      POINT OF VIEW, the print, is blurred... He takes off the
      glasses, looks at the print... and it's clear as a
      bell...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I didn't need glasses anymore...

      And we see Benjamin, naked, standing in front of a full
      length mirror, looking at himself, studying himself....

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   My hair had very little gray and

                   My sense of smell was keener... my
                   hearing more acute... I could walk
                   further and faster...

      He can see outside an ambulance has arrived... to take
      away another of the old people...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   While everybody else was aging...
                   I was getting younger... all
                   alone...

      And as he quietly looks at himself... There's a KNOCK on
      the door..

                                 A MAN'S (V.0.)
                   Benjamin...

      He puts something on, and opens the door. And as if to
      underscore what he's just said, he sees THOMAS BUTTON in
      his fifties himself now, leaning on crutches, his feet
      bandaged, standing in the doorway...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Hello, Benjamin... Do you
                   remember me?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Of course, Mr. Button... What
                   happened to you?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   My foot was infected... I'm afraid
                   they had to remove it...
                        (beat, without irony)
                   Welcome home, my friend.

165   INT. DELMONICO'S STEAK HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945         165

      The bar and restaurant crowded with men, many with
      various kinds of handicaps from the war, drinking away
      their demons... And we see Benjamin and Thomas sitting at
      a table... thick steaks, baked potatoes, drinks at their
      elbows...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're still drinking Sazerac with
                   whiskey instead of brandy.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I'm a man of habit.

                   Are you still visiting the house
                   on Bourbon street?

                   Not for a long time.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I told him about my life... about
                   my time at war... and he told me
                   how he had devoted his business to
                   making buttons for the war
                   effort...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   The war has been kind to the
                   button industry... we had gone
                   from making forty thousand buttons
                   a day to making two hundred and
                   fifty thousand... We employed ten
                   times the number of workers... We
                   were operating around the clock...

      And he quiets... the sound of the busy restaurant... And
      after some moments Thomas tells him...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I don't know how much longer I
                   have to live...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm sorry to hear that, Mr.
                   Button.

      And it seems like he is about to tell Benjamin the entire
      truth... but he can't bring himself and instead...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I don't have any people. I keep to
                   myself. I -- I'm frightened. I
                   hope you won't mind... but
                   whenever it's possible... I would
                   enjoy your company...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'll do what I can, Mr. Button.

      They quietly eat.

                "bouton," meaning a bud, or any
                round object...

      They come into a corridor. Thomas unlocking another door.

                They were originally decorative,

                              THOMAS BUTTON
                The practice of buttoning
                originated in the 13th century...
                when baggy clothing was replaced
                with more form-fitting clothes...

      Thomas, on his crutches...past the lines of work
      benches... Mannequins in uniforms of the armed
      services... with their various gold and silver buttons...

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                Button's Buttons has been in our
                family for one hundred and twenty-
                four years. My grandfather was a
                tailor. He had a small shop in
                Richmond. After the Civil War he
                came to New Orleans.

                   My father saw the wisdom of making
                   our own buttons. The tailor shop
                   grew to this... And today...
                        (a smile)
                   I can't sew a stitch.

      Benjamin is interested, but the obvious question is...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   It's all very interesting.   But
                   what do you want from me?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I said, our family has been in the
                   business for a hundred and twenty-
                   four years.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Our family?

      And it's as if he has opened a flood gate...

                   You are my family. Benjamin, you
                   are my son.

      And tears run down his anguished face... Benjamin's
      still...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I am so sorry not to have told you
                   before...

      Benjamin hasn't moved. The words ring in his ears.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   You were born the night the great
                   war ended... Your mother died
                   giving birth to you... I
                   thought... I thought you were a
                   monster... I left you on the back
                   steps of a house... I promised
                   your mother I'd make sure you were
                   safe... I should never have
                   abandoned you...

      Benjamin's dead quiet... He looks at this man, his
      father...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   My mother?

169   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, THE GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1945       169

      We see Benjamin and Thomas in a hallway leading to the
      kitchen of the large house... The hallway filled with:
      photographs of the Button Family. Thomas pointing out
      relatives... Family photographs...

                               THOMAS BUTTON
                ...A great uncle, from Germany.
                      (and a group picture)
                All of the men in the family at
                the Lake House...
                      (notices the date on
                       it)
                1915, three years before you were
                born.

      A photograph of an old man sitting in a wooden deck chair
      on the dock of a lake.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                Your grandfather at the summer
                house on Lake Pontchartrain. When
                I was a boy I would love to wake
                up before anybody else and run
                down to the lake to watch the day
                begin. It was as if I was the only
                one alive.

      And they've come to a young Woman's photograph... who
      could only be Benjamin's mother. He stops...

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                I fell in love with her the first
                time I saw her.
                     (beat)
                Your mother's name was Caroline
                Murphy. She was 20. She worked in
                your grandfather's kitchen...She
                was from Dublin... Her father,
                your maternal grandfather, was a
                chimney sweep... He died in the
                flu epidemic of 1900... Caroline
                came with her mother, two sisters,
                and four brothers in 1903 to live
                in New Orleans.

      They stop at the kitchen door.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                I would find reasons to go to the
                kitchen... just to look at her...

                                                                  116.

      He does just that... Looking through the round window
      into the empty kitchen... as if she was there those years
      ago... as if she was still there...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   The happiest day of my life was
                   April 25th, 1918 the day I married
                   your mother.

      They move along the hallway... Benjamin looking at the
      photographs... his bloodlines... After some moments:

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Why didn't you tell me?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I made a mistake.

      Benjamin looks at him.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   Come and take your rightful
                   place... with your family... with
                   me...

      When Benjamin doesn't say anything...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   We can catch up for all the lost
                   time...

      And when he still doesn't answer...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I'm planning on leaving everything
                   I have to you...

      His "bribe" strikes a nerve.

                                  BENJAMIN
                   I better go.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Where are you going?

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Home.

      Benjamin turns his back and walks out.

                                                                   117.



170   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1946                            170

      Benjamin standing by the door, Queenie sitting up in her
      bed...

                              QUEENIE
                     (unforgiving,
                      angrily)
                He's what?! All those years he's
                creeping around here, and never
                tells us who he is?!! I thought he
                was just queer or somethin' comin'
                around here... always askin' for
                you... He left us $18 that night
                you was found... Eighteen ratty
                ass dollars and a dirty diaper...!
                Now he wants to be your father? He
                wants you to sit at his side...!
                He wants your forgiveness! I won't
                ever forgive him for any of it...
                God's the only one that can
                forgive him!
                     (finished)
                Now I got to get up early with
                Mrs. Hamilton... or she gonna
                drown...
                     (but not finished)
                ...He thinks he can just show up,
                and everything gonna be fine and
                dandy, everybody gonna be
                friends... He got another thing
                coming...

      And with that she turns over, to go back to sleep,
      Benjamin quietly leaves the room.

171   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - BACK STAIRS, HALLWAY - NIGHT          171

      He climbs the back stairs to his room, as if he's
      carrying a terrible burden... as he comes onto the
      hallway, Mr. Daws is sitting on a bench in the hall...
      Seeing Benjamin...

                              MR. DAWS
                Did I ever tell you I was struck
                by lightning seven different
                times. Once, I was walking my dog
                along a country road.

      And we see just that, when suddenly he's struck by
      lightning. The dog, unharmed, licking his face.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      118.

171   CONTINUED:                                                      171

                                 MR. DAWS (CONT'D)
                   I'm blind in the one eye...I can't
                   hardly hear...I get twitches and
                   shakes out of nowhere... I lose my
                   line of thought... but you know
                   what... God, for some reason,
                   keeps on sending me a wake-up...
                   It's His way of reminding me I'm
                   lucky to be alive...
                        (a beat, sniffs the
                         air)
                   Storm's comin'.

      And   gets up and pads off into his room. Benjamin, left in
      the   hallway...He goes over to look out the window, like
      the   boy we remember looking out at the street lights...
      the   street...

172   EXT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                172

      We see Benjamin being let in by a Butler into the
      fashionable home.

173   INT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                173

      Benjamin in the dark hallway, quietly walking among the
      photographs of "his" family. He goes up the staircase. He
      goes to his father's room. He quietly opens the door. The
      room's dark, his father asleep. He goes to his father's
      bed. His father's frail figure.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (whispers)
                   Thomas...

      Thomas awakens...seeing Benjamin...

174   EXT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                174

      We see Benjamin wheeling his father in a wheelchair out
      of the house...And...

175   EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - SUNRISE                    175

      The endless lake. And we see Mr. Button's chauffeured car
      driving along the lake.

176   EXT. THE BUTTON SUMMER HOME, LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN - SUNRISE 176

      The car's stopped at a chain across the driveway of an
      old summer home. Benjamin helps to put Thomas into his
      wheelchair. He wheels him up the long drive to the house.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                     119.

176   CONTINUED:                                                     176

      All closed up. Shuttered. There are steps that lead down
      to the lake. He starts to wheel his father down the
      steps. The steps are too steep for the wheelchair.
      Benjamin reaches, picking his father up out of the chair.
      He carries him down the steps, but that too is arduous...

      And he puts his father on his back...His father holding
      onto his son, as Benjamin carries him on his back down
      the steps to the dock. There's an old wooden deck chair.
      He helps his father sit in the chair. And as his father
      sits for the last time, watching the lake...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Thank you, Benjamin.

      Benjamin sitting at a distance behind him...Both of them
      watching the day begin...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   You can be mad as a mad dog at the
                   way things went...You can swear,
                   curse the fates, regret everything
                   you ever did... but when it comes
                   to the end... You have to let
                   go...

      And as his father shuts his eyes, sitting in the sun.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   I buried him in the Button family
                   plot.

177   EXT. AN OLD CEMETERY, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1946                  177

      We see Benjamin standing at his father's gravesite in the
      family plot, with ornate headstones...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I had a tailor sew onto his best
                   coat -- a button for every year of
                   his life....fifty-five of them...
                   all different, pearl and silver,
                   brass and wood... in case he lost
                   one along the way...

      And as he stands at the gravesite... He hears something.
      Queenie has come to be with him...to comfort him...

                                 QUEENIE
                        (why she's here)
                   Don't you suffer alone for it.

      She takes his arm, always there for him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                      120.

177   CONTINUED:                                                      177

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                        (looking around)
                   It's a beautiful cemetery... And
                   buried here right next to your
                   mother.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (looks at her)
                   His wife.

      And as they stand at the gravesite...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I went to pay a visit to the
                   button factory.

178   INT. BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1946                    178

      We see Benjamin with an elderly woman, MS. SANDERSON,
      standing at the railing of a mezzanine above the factory
      work floor... looking down upon the workers, exclusively
      women, and exclusively white women, making buttons...The
      women, seeing him, look up, and there's a sudden hush...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   My name is Benjamin, Benjamin...
                        (for the first time)
                   Button...

      They stare up at him...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   As you know, my father...

      It still sounds strange to him.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   ...My father, Thomas Button...
                   recently passed...

      After a moment:

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   He asked that I take over the day
                   to day operation of Button's
                   Buttons.

      They silently stare up at him....

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Well, I don't know the first thing
                   about buttons...and I don't know a
                   thing about business...
                                 (MORE)

178   CONTINUED:                                                  178
                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        (after a beat)
                   Button's Buttons has been in my
                   father's family for over 100
                   years. It could not have survived
                   without people like you. My father
                   asked me to tell you how much he
                   appreciated the hard work you put
                   in for him and his company for so
                   many years.

      Dead still... And after a moment;

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I have decided that all of you --
                   his loyal employees, will have a
                   share, depending on your length of
                   employment, in the ownership of
                   this factory, his legacy.

                                 ONE OF THE WOMEN
                   We're the owners now?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   That's about it.

      They're literally dumbfounded.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Mrs. Sanderson will explain how
                   everything works and will answer
                   any of your questions...

      And with that he turns, walking away...Having "given away
      the store"... the workers in disbelief looking up at
      him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I went to New York.

179   EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT, 1947                           179

      We see a cab pull up and Benjamin, in a nice suit,
      flowers in hand, daisies, gets out, hurrying into The
      Majestic Theater, the marquee telling us "CAROUSEL," is
      performing.

180   INT. THE MAJESTIC THEATER, NYC - NIGHT, 1947                180

      Benjamin, coming in late, being shown to his seat. And we
      see the production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical
      "Carousel," with Mielziner's seminal stage design, as
      choreographed by Agnes De Mille... And we see the dancer
      is Daisy...dancing with the man of her dreams, the "bad
      boy" carnival barker... while Benjamin watches her.

                                                                   122.



181   INT. BACKSTAGE, THE MAJESTIC THEATER - NYC - NIGHT, 1947     181

      We see Benjamin, flowers in hand, making his way through
      a crowded backstage corridor filled with friends and well-
      wishers giving cast members congratulations. He comes to
      the door... to the attention of a STAGEHAND...

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm a friend of Daisy's...

      The man matter-of-factly opens the door... A dressing
      room crowded with dancers changing out of their
      Costumes... He calls out...

                              THE MAN
                Daisy has company...

      We can hear Daisy's name being said...Benjamin waiting...
      He sees Daisy, in a robe, coming through the room....

                              DAISY
                Somebody's looking for me?...

      ...And she sees it's Benjamin. And rather than excited to
      see him... She's startled he's there... and not
      altogether pleased about him showing up...

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                Benjamin... What are you doing
                here?

      And he realizes, as most of us have in one love affair or
      another, whatever his expectations may have been, his
      fantasy, is not the reality...

                              BENJAMIN
                I thought I'd come visit... spend
                some time with you if I could...

                              DAISY
                I wish you would have called...
                You caught me by surprise.

      He gives her the flowers, the daisies.

                              BENJAMIN
                I couldn't take my eyes off of
                you... you were mesmerizing...

                              DAISY
                That's so nice of you to say...
                These are lovely... Thank you...

      There's an awkward moment... and...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I better get changed... a group of
                   us are going to a party... would
                   you like to come...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Somebody told me about a
                   restaurant I thought you might
                   enjoy... I made a reservation...
                   Just in case --

                                 DAISY
                        (awkwardly)
                   ...all the dancers go out together
                   after the show... You're welcome
                   to come with us... There'll be all
                   sorts of interesting people... Let
                   me get changed.

      And she runs back inside the dressing room... Benjamin
      left to stand in the hallway....

182   INT. A NEW YORK LOFT - NIGHT, 1947                              182

      A loft elevator opens depositing Benjamin and Daisy along
      with a bunch of people into a large loft... crowded with
      her friends, dancers and show people, musicians,
      predominantly young people, straight and gay, beatniks
      before there were beatniks, bohemians... Music playing...
      People pressed together, having to shout to talk...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I met her friends...

                                 DAISY
                   I'll get you a drink...

      As she turns to a kitchen to get him a drink, she is
      startled as a young man, DAVID, suddenly grabs her,
      kissing her, a kiss that's not intended to be platonic...
      Daisy obviously involved with him... but embarrassed by
      the intimacy in front of Benjamin and not wanting to hurt
      his feelings... she pulls awkwardly away from him...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   This is my friend David... David
                   dances with our company too...
                   This is the man I've told you
                   about, Benjamin...

      They shake hands... Daisy, wanting to escape.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                   I'll get you that drink. - -

      ...she goes into the kitchen...

                                 DAVID
                   You were her grandmother's friend
                   or something like that...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Something like that.

      And Daisy comes back out with a drink for him... and one
      of her own... But before she can give him his drink, a
      woman takes it from her... and starts to dance with
      her... but not with her... the way dancers do... and many
      of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like
      it... David, comes to dance with Daisy... Benjamin
      standing watching Daisy dancing with him... as only
      dancers can... in complete control of their bodies and
      yet totally uninhibited... Benjamin sees David kiss
      her... and his jealousy getting the best of him, he turns
      and leaves...

183   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              183

      Daisy in her turban... listening to Caroline read..

                                  DAISY
                        (whispers)
                   I knew I'd hurt you... Maybe I
                   intended to...

184   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT, 1947                              184

      Benjamin on his way out of the apartment coming along the
      street. Daisy running after him...

                                 DAISY
                   I did what you told me to... enjoy
                   my life... I'm only going to be
                   young once... I had no idea you
                   were coming. What did you think I
                   was going to do...? You can't
                   expect me to just drop everything,
                   Benjamin... this is my life...

      And we see DAVID and a group of her dancer friends have
      come outside down the way into the street... looking for
      cabs...

                   There's a party downtown we're

                        (conflicted, to
                         Benjamin)
                   Why don't you come with us,
                   Benjamin... There'll be a lot of
                   musicians, interesting people
                   there.... You'll have a good
                   time...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I came here to tell you I made a
                   mistake before...A day doesn't go
                   by that I don't regret it...It's
                   not the way I felt...I should have
                   never let you go...I came because
                   I hoped I could be with you...

                                 DAVID
                   Daisy, you going to come...?

      Cabs have pulled up... She's torn... between her life and
      some other life... Benjamin, recognizing her conflict...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Do you love him?

185   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              185

      Daisy in bed...

                                 CAROLINE
                   Did you Mother?

      Daisy snaps back to the reality of the room... Starts to
      put the pieces together...

186   EXT. THE MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT, 1947                         186

                                 DAISY
                   I think so. I think I do.

      We see the dancers scrambling getting into the taxis...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (understanding)
                   Okay. Okay... I'll see you in New
                   Orleans...

      He turns to go... she's motionless, caught between the
      two worlds... And we expect her to yell after him, to
      stop him... But instead, she does what we all do in these
      moments, what feels good at the time... She runs to be
      with her friends... She gets into a taxi... The cab
      drives by him as they leave... Daisy turned to look out
      the back window... looking back at him... He waves...
      letting her go... And another chance for them is
      missed... The street's quiet. And hands in his pockets, a
      middle-aged man going on 26... he walks off into the
      night...

187   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          187

                   He came to tell me his father had
                   died.

                                 CAROLINE
                   You couldn't have known.

                                 DAISY
                   I was 23...I just didn't care...

      She's quiet with her thoughts... and, remembering, she
      hums to herself some distant memory of music...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...There are some photographs I
                   think... the zipper part of the
                   large bag...

      Caroline goes to the suitcases... she comes back with a
      manila envelope... Daisy dumps them out...and we see
      they're photographs of Daisy dancing at the height of her
      abilities...

                                 CAROLINE
                   I've never seen these... You never
                   talked about your dancing very
                   much...

      Daisy looks at the photographs...

                                 DAISY
                   I was as good as I was ever going
                   to be. For five years... I danced
                   everywhere... London, Prague,
                   Vienna, and I was the only
                   American invited to dance with the
                   Bolshoi... It was glorious...

                                                                   127.

      And we see Daisy, five years older, her arm inside a tall
      young blond Russian dancer's, ANITOLY, crossing a snowy
      street in Moscow...

                But Benjamin was never far from my
                thoughts...

                I'd find myself saying...

                Goodnight, Benjamin...

190   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1952              190

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                I'd find myself saying...
                     (a beat, saying)
                Goodnight, Daisy.

      And as they both lie in their beds... thinking of the
      other...

191   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT       191

                "Life wasn't very complicated..."

      Benjamin in work clothes on a ladder, painting some old
      window shutters... Queenie opens the window... to tell
      him...

                                 QUEENIE
                   Mrs. La Tourneau just passed away.

      Benjamin nods. Queenie shuts the window.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   Until one day...

      A Messenger on a bicycle rides up...

                                 A WESTERN UNION MESSENGER
                   I have a telegram for Mr. Benjamin
                   Button...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   That would be me....

      He comes down the ladder. The Messenger gives him the
      telegram and getting his tip, rides off, Benjamin opens
      the telegram.

194   EXT. A STREET IN PARIS, FRANCE - DAY, 1954                      194

      street in Paris... looking for an address... He stops, in
      front of an old HOSPITAL... runs up the stairs...

195   INT. A HOSPITAL, PARIS, FRANCE - DAY, 1954                      195

      Benjamin crosses an old tile floor to a reception desk...
      He asks for Daisy... a Woman calls up for him...

                                  THE WOMAN
                   It will just be a minute... please
                   have a seat...

      Benjamin sits in the waiting room.

                   Sometimes we are on a collision
                   course and we just don't know
                   it... Whether it's by accident or

      there... Before he can say anything... A Nurse comes in
      saying something in French... She pulls the curtains
      around the bed... Benjamin waits...

                   stand...maybe even walk...

      The Nurse leaves... Benjamin comes into the circle of
      curtains... It's reminiscent of when they sat under the
      table... the sheets over them... in their private
      world... But this time she lays in the hospital bed her
      back to him...

                   can leave you'll come home with me
                   to New Orleans. Where you can be
                   with people who love you.

                   What home? Who's we? I'm not going

                 We're not little children playing
                 under the table... Remember, when
                 you came to New York. You didn't
                 belong there. I didn't want to be
                 with you then, I don't want to be
                 with you now! I want you to leave!
                 I'm not going anywhere with you! I
                 want you to stay out of my life!

       And she turns away from him again...It's dead still...

       remnants of her mortality... The Nurse coming into the
       room... Caroline behind her... times her pulse.

                               THE NURSE
                 Let's get you comfortable.

       She raises the morphine level...straightens her
       covers...she stops before she leaves...motions to
       Caroline...Caroline going over to her.

                               THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Pulse rate's slowing...She's
                 getting less oxygen...You'll
                 notice her struggle to
                 breathe...Will you be alright?

       Caroline nods...The Nurse gives her a compassionate look
       and leaves...Caroline stands, her arms protectively
       across her chest, watching her mother...Daisy hums the
       particular ragtime song that Benjamin would play on the
       piano...She opens her eyes, as if not completely sure
       where she is...telling Caroline...

                               DAISY
                 Every morning Monsieur Foley
                 leaves eggs and bread and mil,.
                 There's a cafe across the street.
                 People sitting and drinking and
                 talking... I lay on my bed
                 thinking about the rest of my
                 life... about people... about
                 home... until I fall asleep.

       She looks at Caroline as if to say, "What happened to
       him...?"

                    He said, "I went back..." But then
                    there are a whole lot of pages
                    torn out...

       She looks at a loose piece of paper...

                                  CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                    "...I listened to the sound of the
                    house..." I think I already read
                    that...
                         (looking)
                    The next thing he wrote... he
                    spilled something on it... It's
                    hard to read... Something about
                    "sailing." Does that make sense?

                                  DAISY
                         (in her own reality)
                    A man would go up and clean it.
                    Try and fix what was broken.

198    INT. THE TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS- DAY, 1960                 198

       A man up on the clock doing just that. Closing its face.
       The cherubic angels pushing the hands on its way
       backwards... "1960."

199    EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - ANOTHER DAY, 1960         199

       We see a SAILBOAT out on the lake...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
                    I learned to sail on an old boat
                    of my father's from the Lake
                    House...

       And we see Benjamin, the wind in his hair, sailing an old
       sailboat... And the change in his appearance is
       startling... His hair is without a trace of gray... His
       face with barely a wrinkle, chiseled...He is a healthy
       man in his 40s now...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I can't lie, I did enjoy the
                    company of a woman or two...

                                                                   137.



200    EXT. A NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT                       200

       Benjamin and a Woman standing on the sidewalk outside a
       restaurant, in the middle of an ardent kiss... As a taxi
       pulls up...

200A   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - DAYBREAK                         200A

       Benjamin at the door kissing another Woman
       goodbye...going home

200B   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ANOTHER           200B
       MORNING, 1960

       Benjamin's door opening...Another Woman, disheveled,
       coming out of his room...

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                 ...Or maybe three...

       Benjamin seeing her to the stairs...And as she starts
       down the stairs to leave...we see a cluster of old
       people, ready for the day, looking up at them...the woman
       making her way awkwardly down the stairs and out the
       door...Benjamin gives a little self conscious wave to the
       old timers and starts back into his room...He slows at a
       second story hallway window...looking outside at the
       walkway...the familiar street beyond...If we didn't know
       any better he seems to be waiting for someone to come
       home

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                 And in the spring of 1962...

201    EXT. THE STREET, BY NOLAN HOUSE - END OF THE DAY, 1962      201

       We see Benjamin riding the old motorcycle along the
       street on his way home... leaves the motorcycle out in
       front...

202    EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - END OF THE DAY, 1962                 202

       He comes to the gate, opening it, coming into the yard,
       shutting the gate behind him, going up the walkway. An
       Old Man is on the porch, quietly rocking. And Queenie,
       for some reason is standing just outside the front door
       on the porch... an apron in her hands... She nods to
       Benjamin... talking to the Old Man in the rocking
       chair... but she seems to be watching Benjamin, as he
       walks around the house -- to the back door. He takes off
       his dirty work boots, leaves them on the porch.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                        138.

202   CONTINUED:                                                        202

      He hops the back steps, and starts to open the kitchen
      door, when it opens... And DAISY, now 36, but still with
      her unmistakable blue eyes, is standing before him...

                                    BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She came back.

      They look at each other in silence...and they simply
      smile, so glad to see each other after all the missing
      years... They embrace...for some time... and kiss... As
      people who haven't seen each other, and have thought
      about each other... for a very long time... And it just
      is...no big symphonies, no endless skies...just, two
      people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives...
      and the simplicity, just that, is what makes it real and
      breaks your heart.

203   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962                  203

      A radio plays... they sit at the kitchen table, eating
      dinner... the conversation muted... They don't know
      really where to begin, where did they leave oft...so they
      don't begin until they can....

                                 DAISY
                   Don't you want to know where I've
                   been?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   No. I don't care where you've been
                   -- I'm just happy you're back.

      And we see Queenie has come into the kitchen... in her
      nightgown now...

                                  QUEENIE
                         (pure Queenie)
                   How come you didn't write or
                   nothin'? Just disappearing like
                   that?

                                 DAISY
                   It was what I needed to do for
                   myself.

                                 QUEENIE
                   I never took you to be selfish. I
                   hope I'm not wrong. I'm not
                   usually wrong about people.

      And Queenie leaves the kitchen...

                                 DAISY
                   She's still taking care of you.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                   139.

203   CONTINUED:                                                   203

      Benjamin slightly smiles. They look at each other.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You're not talking. You haven't
                   said more than two words to me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't want to ruin it...

      And they sit quietly in the kitchen, looking at each
      other, silently eating...

204   INT. BACK STAIRWAY - NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962          204

      Benjamin carries her bags upstairs. They reach the third
      floor.

205   INT. HALLWAY, NOLAN HOUSE - 3RD FLOOR - THAT NIGHT, 1962     205

      All the years seem to surround them. They walk along the
      corridor to Daisy's room. What was her grandmother's
      room. She opens the door.

206   INT. THE BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962             206

      He sets her bags down. Queenie despite her reservations
      has left some clean towels on the bed for her... There's
      an inept quiet. The two of them with nothing left to
      say... And they listen to the quiet... The house with its
      symphony of night noises...

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Goodnight.

      He is just at the door... when she says...

                                    DAISY
                   Sleep with me.

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Are you sure?

                                    DAISY
                   Yes.

      He turns to her. They look at each other. And they kiss,
      A kiss that has waited for thirty years. A kiss that has
      waited a lifetime. And yes, there is passion... and
      need... but most particularly, the awkwardness of people
      discovering each other for the first time... While he
      gently, tenderly, kisses her, undresses her..

206   CONTINUED:                                                     206

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you sure you don't want to
                   know?...

      While they kiss and caress each other.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I lived in Lyon...

      Benjamin and Daisy undressing one another, touching,
      kissing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I learned to walk again

      Daisy and Benjamin, naked, passionately kissing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I worked in a flower shop...

      They lay on the bed, kissing, caressing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I went to American movies a
                   lot.

      They kiss more and more passionately...And Benjamin about
      to make love to her hesitates...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You won't hurt me...

      He kisses her scarred crooked leg. Kisses her body.     And
      as they make love in the old bedroom...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I asked her to come with me...

      What follows feels like a HOME MOVIE...without any sound.

207   EXT. THE FLORIDA GULF COAST - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                207

      And we see the small sailboat out on the gulf coast...

                                 BENJAMIN SUTTON'S (V.0,)
                   We sailed into the Gulf... along
                   the Florida coast...

208   EXT. THE FLORIDA COAST, A COVE - DAY, 1963                     208

      Daisy and Benjamin on the sailboat at a cove on the
      Florida coast. They watch a ROCKET, soaring into space
      from Cape Caniveral.

      As they watch it roar overhead, Benjamin marvels at its
      power...leaving its trail across the sky...Daisy, not so
      much interested, taking his arm, taking him back down
      below...

209   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - DAY, 1963                   209

      Daisy washing her hair off the side of the boat.

210   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - NIGHT                       210

      The boat anchored. Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the
      deck having a picnic with just a single lamp for light.

211   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - NIGHT, 1963                 211

      The boat in still another cove. Daisy and Benjamin in
      the water. Just their eyes above the dark water looking
      only at each other.

212   EXT. THE BOAT - CARIBBEAN -    NIGHT, 1963                     212

      The boat out on the water, Daisy sitting on the deck, the
      wind in her hair... Benjamin at the wheel...threatening
      clouds on the horizon...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   I'm so glad we didn't find one
                   another when I was 26... I'm glad
                   we missed...

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.0.)
                   Why do you say that?

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   It wasn't right...

215   INT. A CARIBBEAN HOTEL, BAR - DAY, 1963                        215

      A small Caribbean hotel. We see Benjamin and Daisy
      sitting at a table drinking, talking in a nearly empty
      bar... wind and rain lashing the hotel... waiting out a
      tropical storm...

                                 DAISY
                   We wouldn't have this... We
                   wouldn't be here... It happened
                   when it was supposed to happen...

      They look at each other...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Relationships have a time and a
                   place.

                                 DAISY
                   Don't say that.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What I mean is... You don't
                   usually get more than one chance.
                   If you miss it, it's too late...
                   and it's gone... We're lucky... we
                   had more than one chance.

                                 DAISY
                        (laughs)
                   That's easy for you to say...
                   You'll have plenty of chances.

      She tenderly touches his hand... They look at each
      other... And dedicating herself...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm going to enjoy every moment I
                   have with you...

      The waiter's come over.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Have you ever had a Sazerac with
                   whiskey not brandy?

                                 DAISY'S
                        (smiles)
                   I'm with you, aren't I?   I'll try
                   anything.

      And the wind changes direction, the rain coming in
      through the open windows of the bar, getting them wet...
      people run for cover...

                                 DAISY
                   Bet I can stay out here longer
                   than you can.

                                 BENJAMIN
                Bet you can't.

      And as they both sit doggedly in the rain...

216   INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CARIBBEAN HOTEL - NIGHT, 1963           216

      A white hotel room... The storm shutters closed... The
      wind and the rain banging at the shutters... Daisy and
      Benjamin lying together on a bed out of the storm... She
      touches his face as if for the first time...

                              DAISY
                You barely have a line, a crease,
                or a wrinkle... Everyday I have
                more wrinkles you have less...

      He touches her face.

                              BENJAMIN
                I love your wrinkles.

                              DAISY
                What does it feel like growing
                younger?

                              BENJAMIN
                I don't know... I'm always looking
                out of my own eyes...

      They're quiet, just the sound of the rain and the
      chattering shutters... She lays closer to him...
      warmly... She smiles...

                              DAISY
                Will you still love me when I
                can't stand straight... when my
                skin grows old and spotted...

      Benjamin laughs.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                Will you still love me when my
                step gets slow... when I sleep too
                much... when you have to push me
                in a chair...

      And his answer is...

                              BENJAMIN
                Will you still love me when I have
                pimples. When I think it's funny
                to make fart noises...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                  144.

216   CONTINUED:                                                  216

      She laughs...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Will you still love me when I
                   think all girls have cooties...
                   Will you still love me when I wet
                   my bed at night... Will you still
                   love me when I'm afraid of things
                   that aren't real...

      They hold each other... And Benjamin says... from what
      he's seen...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Nothing lasts...

                                 DAISY
                   Maybe some things last...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I've never seen anything not come
                   to an end...

                                 DAISY
                   Maybe it's something you can't
                   see...

      And a shutter slams open... the rain and the wind coming
      into the room... Benjamin gets up to close it... He comes
      back into bed... And Daisy, suddenly afraid...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm cold, Benjamin...

      And as he holds her in the white room with the wind and
      the rain trying to get in, banging on the shutters...

217   INT. HOTEL ROOM, CARIBBEAN HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT, 1963 217

      The storm's died down... Benjamin and Daisy falling
      asleep...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And you said...

                                 DAISY
                   Goodnight, Benjamin.

                                   BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   And I said...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Goodnight, Daisy...

                                                                  145.



218   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          218

                              DAISY
                     (that she's stopped)
                Caroline?

                              CAROLINE
                     (after a beat,
                      slightly confused)
                I don't understand. When did you
                meet Dad?

                              DAISY
                Dear Robert... some time after
                that...

                              CAROLINE
                Did you ever tell him about this
                Benjamin?

                              DAISY
                He knew enough. He loved me as I
                was. I loved him for who he was.
                What more was needed?

      She trails off... she's quiet... and wanting to know
      what's next, reading on...

                              CAROLINE
                "That night, in the Caribbean I
                had a visitor..."

219   INT. HOTEL ROOM, CARIBBEAN HOTEL - MIDDLE OF NIGHT, 1963    219

      Benjamin and Daisy sleeping... the shutters quietly
      talking on a breeze... when one of the shutters SLAMS
      open as if somebody's come in... Benjamin wakes up... And
      he literally sees QUEENIE is sitting on the side of the
      bed beside him...

                              QUEENIE
                I wanted to tell you I love you
                and your mama's gone...

      And she bends, sweetly kissing him...

      And Benjamin rolls over... His eyes come open... Daisy
      sensing he's awake, awakening, murmurs...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                  146.

                                 DAISY
                   Is anything wrong?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Queenie came to tell me she loved
                   me... and that my mother was gone.

                                 DAISY
                   ...go back to sleep...

      As she caresses him... falling back to sleep... the
      shutters talking...

220   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1963       220

      We see Daisy and Benjamin, with their few belongings,
      returning home... They go up the walkway... Benjamin
      trots up the steps, opens the screen door and goes
      inside...

221   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1963       221

      Benjamin comes inside... Daisy's just behind him... The
      front room is empty... The house still...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (calls)
                   Hello... Queenie... we're back...

      He looks into the parlor... The piano... He goes down a
      hallway into the kitchen...

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Queenie...?   Mama?

      Nobody... He goes down the hall looking in Queenie's
      small room under the stairs... Nobody's there... He moves
      back into the front room... calling...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Hello... Anybody here?

      When finally an old Woman, who's been sleeping, comes out
      of her bedroom...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   It's Benjamin, Mrs. Carter...
                   Where is everybody?

                                 THE OLD WOMAN
                   Benjamin... your mother died.

                                                                   147.



222   INT. A BLACK BAPTIST CHURCH, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963         222

      The church crowded... And we see Benjamin and Daisy
      coming in the back as the service is ending... They are
      the only white people there. Benjamin walks to the open
      casket... standing by his mother's side as the choir
      sings a Hallelujah chorus...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We buried her beside her beloved
                Mr. Weathers...

223   EXT. AN OLD NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1963                 223

      A predominantly African-American cemetery... overgrown
      and old... The mourners, almost all of them old white
      people, standing at Queenie's gravesite alongside her
      beloved Mr. Weathers. We see Queenie's daughter among
      the mourners... in her early 30s herself now... And
      Benjamin, standing over his mother's grave... saying his
      goodbyes...

                              BENJAMIN
                We are meant to lose the people we
                love. It's how we know how
                important they are to us.

                              BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                And so we could have memories of
                our own I sold my Father's house
                on Blaine Street...

224   EXT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, GARDEN DISTRICT - DAY, 1963           224

      The old house, in a now decaying New Orleans
      neighborhood... but despite the faltering area, the house
      retains a dignity of its own...

225   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                    225

      We see a young pregnant Woman, a renter, being shown by
      Benjamin along with a Real Estate Agent, around the old
      house.

                              THE WOMAN
                ...It's such a lovely place... You
                must have a lot of fond memories.
                It must be hard for you to give it
                up.

      Benjamin doesn't say anything. There's a knock on the
      door. Benjamin opens it, to let an OLDER MAN in... quite
      a bit older...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                148.

225   CONTINUED:                                                225

                                 THE MAN
                   Is Mrs. Williamson here yet... I'm
                   sorry to be late...

      And he sees his wife... pleased to see her... hugging
      her... tenderly kissing her... and their age difference
      readily obvious... Benjamin acutely aware of it...

                                 THE WOMAN
                   It's a wonderful old place,
                   darling... I think we will be so
                   happy here...

      They go into the hallway lined with the family
      photographs... She's taken by them...

                                 THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                   Oh, what a long family history you
                   have...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   They come with the house...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   And we bought a house of our
                   own...

226   EXT. A SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963        226

      Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the front steps of a
      suburban New Orleans townhouse, a small screened front
      porch with a tree in front...

227   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT            227

                                 DAISY
                        (murmurs)
                   I loved that house... it smelled
                   like firewood... The chimney
                   leaked smoke... We didn't care...
                   Oh don't stop dear... don't
                   stop...

      She closes her eyes...

                                  CAROLINE'S VOICE (OVER)
                   "It was one of the happiest times
                   of my life..."

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   We had no furniture to speak of...
                   we would have picnics in the
                   living room...

                                                                    149.

      Benjamin and Daisy having a picnic on the virtually empty
      living room floor.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0,)
                We slept on a mattress...

229   INT. BEDROOM, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS DAY, 1963       229

      We see Benjamin and Daisy sleeping on a mattress on the
      floor in the bedroom...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We vowed never to go to bed or
                wake up at the same time. We
                lived on that mattress...

      And we see just that, a short film of two people who
      can't get enough of each other living on a mattress...
      Daisy and Benjamin at various times, while they are
      either sleeping, or talking, or eating, or reading, or
      making love, ON THE MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Our neighbor, Mrs. Van Dam was a
                physical therapist...

230   INT. PORCH, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1953       230

      We see Daisy in the screened-in front porch, exercising
      her leg under the supervision of an older woman... MRS.
      VAN DAM...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                We lived four blocks from a public
                pool...

231   INT. A PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL, YWCA - DAY, 1963                 231

      We see Daisy in a bathing suit, resting from swimming,
      holding on to the side of the pool, watching a young,
      well conditioned girl, 18, with nothing but her life
      ahead of her, completely in tune with her body, swimming
      laps... And as it comes to all of us, painfully aware of
      the years passing, her own physical mortality, she starts
      to cry... And we see that Benjamin, come to meet her, is
      standing above her.

                              BENJAMIN
                You're crying...



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                      150.

231   CONTINUED:                                                      231

                                 DAISY
                   It's just the chlorine...

      Looking at the young girl... looking at her...
      understanding...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You chose something to do...
                   something so special... so
                   unique... there was such a short
                   period of time that you could do
                   it... Even if nothing had happened
                   ... Sooner or later you would be
                   in the same place you are now...

      She's quiet... she knows what he's saying is true...

                                 DAISY
                   I don't like getting old.

232   EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - DAYBREAK, 1964             232

      Benjamin, Daisy holding onto him, riding the old
      motorcycle along the lake...

233   EXT. THE DOCK AT THE LAKE - DAYBREAK, 1964                      233

      Daisy sits in the familiar deck chair his father had sat
      in looking out at the lake... Benjamin brings her a cup
      of coffee... He sits on the deck on his heels beside
      her...

                                 DAISY
                   I promise you, I'll never lose
                   myself to self-pity again...

      And as they watch the day begin...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I think, right there and then,
                   she realized none of us is perfect
                   forever.

234   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          234

      The window has started to rattle again... the wind
      knocking.

                                 CAROLINE
                   I thought the wind had shifted
                   away...



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                     151.

234   CONTINUED:                                                     234

      Daisy doesn't say anything, lying still, staring off...
      her breathing shallow, laboring...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Mother?

                                 DAISY
                        (agitated)
                   I don't remember if I turned the
                   lights off. Did I leave the
                   heater on?

      The Nurse, on her way by, seeing her distress... coming
      in...

                                 THE NURSE
                   Let's get you comfortable...

      She gently covers her... Daisy quietly lies back...

                                 THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                   She's getting ready to leave...

      She looks at Caroline and turns and leaves the room.
      Caroline quietly looks at her mother. Their eyes meet.

                                 DAISY
                   You have the most beautiful eyes.

      Caroline reaches to hold her thin hand. Daisy says
      something to herself. Caroline looks at her...she looks
      down at the book...

                                 CAROLINE
                   He said, "She found peace."

                                 DAISY
                        (says to herself)
                   Peace.

235   INT. A DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1967                   235

      A small dance studio... a scratchy phonograph record
      playing music... young girls learning how to dance...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She opened a dance studio...

      And we see Daisy, in a long skirt over a long sleeved
      leotard... wearing slippers...




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                      152.

      The first time we've seen her dressed like this in many a
      year... happily teaching young girls how to dance...

236   INT. DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1967                    236

      We see Daisy alone... cleaning up... music playing on the
      record player... and for a brief moment she stops, and
      dances... the smallest, most tentative of steps... she
      sees in the studio's mirrors Benjamin's been silently
      watching her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're still beautiful to watch...

      She looks at herself in the dance mirror... just what
      happens...

                                 DAISY
                   Dancing is all about the line...
                   the line of your body...after
                   awhile... you lose the line... and
                   you can never get it back...

      They look at each other in the mirror...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I figured out if you were born in
                   1918... 49 years ago... I'm 43...
                   we're almost the same age... In
                   three years we'll meet in the
                   middle...

      And what she doesn't say, what they both know, is she's
      going one way and he's going the other...Benjamin
      affectionately...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (smiles)
                   We finally caught up to each
                   other...

      She smiles, starts to turn...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Stay just like that... I want to
                   remember what we look like right
                   now.

      They stay like that for a moment longer... She turns to
      get her things... She shuts off the lights... She takes
      his arm...



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                 DAISY
                   I thought I was far too old... I'm
                   pregnant...

      He stops... They look at each other, she smiles, nodding
      "yes," it's true. And deeply moved he takes her in his
      arms... grateful...touching her face... holding her...

237   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              237

                   You were pregnant? You never said
                   anything, did you? I mean, what
                   happened to the child?

                                 DAISY
                        (wistful)
                   The child...

      We're not sure what more she is about to say, her
      breathing rasps... she's having some difficulty
      breathing...


                                 CAROLINE
                        (getting up)

                   I want to breathe on my own...
                   Please...(and) sit down, my
                   darling...

      Caroline respects her wishes...

                   I thought I heard the nurse slip,
                   and say "he..."

      As they ride Benjamin looks over watching a father
      sitting with his child... Daisy notices his look...

      Daisy with a hot Fudge sundae and a tuna sandwich...
      Benjamin just some coffee... They're quiet... And Daisy
      says...

                              DAISY
                I know you're afraid.

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm not hiding it.

                               DAISY
                Okay.   What's your worst fear?

                              BENJAMIN
                What if it has...what if its like
                me?...

                              DAISY
                Then we'll love it all the more...

                              BENJAMIN
                I want to be father... not a
                little brother... I don't want to
                be picked up from elementary
                school by my kid... I don't want
                anyone babysitting me...

                              DAISY
                I'm going to make this work...
                This is what I want, and I want it
                with you...

                              BENJAMIN
                You know, there's nothing I
                wouldn't do for you...

                              DAISY
                Would you tell a blind man he
                can't have children? You will be
                a father for as long as you can.
                I know the consequences. I
                accepted that. Your love, loving
                you, is worth everything to me.

      He smiles... She gets up and goes to the restroom. He
      sits with his thoughts... and he notices a television's
      on... a news report... something catches his eye...
      someone swimming? He gets up moving to the television...
      where he hears...

                   The oldest woman to ever swim the
                   English Channel arrived in Calais
                   today... having made the swim in
                   thirty-four hours, twenty-two
                   minutes and fourteen seconds...
                   the sixty-eight year old
                   Englishwoman, Elizabeth Abbott...

      And we see dear ELIZABETH ABBOTT, coming out of the
      water, completing the English Channel swim.

                   Anything's possible.

      And as she smiles, after a lifetime of waiting,
      triumphant... And Benjamin smiles for her, and for
      himself, too... where anything is possible... Daisy's
      come beside him...

                   Yes.

      He leaves some money. He takes her arm... and as they go
      outside, moving along the street...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She gave birth to a five pound
                   four ounce baby girl...

243   INT. THEIR BEDROOM - SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - DAY, 1968               243

      We see, lying on Daisy's chest, is a newborn baby...
      Benjamin, standing beside her... And a young Woman Doctor
      that's there... packing up her things...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're sure there's nothing wrong
                   with her?

                                 THE YOUNG WOMAN DOCTOR
                   She's a normal, healthy baby in
                   every way...

      And Benjamin moved, kisses the baby's head... as he looks
      at this precious child of his...

                                 CAROLINE'S (V.O.)
                   We named her Caroline, for my
                   mother...

      And as Benjamin holds Daisy's hand while she nurses
      her...

244   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT                244

      Caroline's stopped reading... dead still...

                                 CAROLINE
                   He was my father...? This
                   Benjamin was my father?

                                  DAISY
                    It doesn't change for a moment who
                    you are. You were a gift.
                    Sometimes the gifts we are given
                    are not free.

                                  CAROLINE
                    You never said a word to me...

       Caroline, upset, gets up...

                                  CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                    I need to go for a minute...

       She leaves the room...

                         (enigmatic)
                    My dearest darling, we were both
                    deprived of him...

       Daisy lying still... in her turban... her blue eyes...
       her breathing rasping...

244A   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT          244A

       Caroline stands in the hall. The bustle of the hospital,
       the exigencies of life going on about her. The Nurse,
       seeing her...

                                  THE NURSE
                    It can get to you...

       And Caroline, unable to hold it in, can't stop bitter
       tears from running down her face... The Nurse is called
       for... She goes off down the hallway... Caroline takes
       another moment and goes back into the hospital room...

244B   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          244B

       Daisy, seeing her come back in...

                                  DAISY
                    I was worried you weren't coming

       Caroline hesitates, then sits back down, and quietly
       takes up the "book."

                    "You grew, like the doctor had

245    INT. THEIR BEDROOM, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS -        245
       NIGHT, 1969

       The room's dark. We see Benjamin in bed, the baby
       sleeping between him and Daisy... And as Benjamin watches
       them sleep... he looks at his reflection in a wall
       mirror... his 51st year on this earth... 34 years old...
       a young man... He looks at his baby... he looks at
       Daisy... in her mid 40s... her hair's begun to gray...
       her face begun to show the natural touches of age... His
       stare awakens her... She looks at him sensing he's deeply
       troubled... He shuts his eyes... she watches him sleep,
       Daisy as troubled as he is... but for very different
       reasons...

246    EXT. A PARK - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969                        246

       Benjamin is sitting with Caroline while she plays in a
       park's sand box... Caroline helping herself to a mouthful
       of sand... Benjamin, trying to get the sand out of her
       mouth...

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Don't eat sand...

       Daisy comes over to sit with them...

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                    She's going to have a really
                    attractive diaper.

       As they sit watching Caroline playing in the sand...

                   I think you should find a real
                   father for her...

                                 DAISY
                   What are you talking about?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   She needs someone to grow old
                   with...

                                 DAISY
                   She'll learn to accept whatever
                   happens... She loves you...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   She needs a father not a playmate.

                                 DAISY
                   Is it that my age is starting to
                   show...? Is that what you are
                   telling me? Have you lost your
                   desire for me...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You don't need another child to
                   raise...

                                 DAISY
                   You're going to leave me, aren't
                   you?

      He doesn't say anything.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You can't leave me.

      He's silent.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You can't do this to me...!

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It was your first birthday. We
                   had a party... the house was
                   filled with people...

                                                                   159.



247    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969           247

       The birthday party. A cake with a big number "1" candle.
       One-year-olds not having a clue.

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                 The fathers and mothers were
                 there...

       He looks at the age appropriate mothers and fathers with
       their children...

                               A MAN
                 Before you look around they'll be
                 in High School dating.

       Benjamin manages a smile.

                 I remember your first birthday
                 like it was yesterday.

248    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATER IN THE DAY, 1969            248

       The house is empty, the guests gone... Daisy busy
       cleaning up from the party. She stops to look outside,
       at the backyard. Benjamin is sitting on a lounge
       chair... the baby, in her party dress, sitting on his
       chest... As Daisy stands at the window watching him with
       their baby...

249    INT. THEIR BEDROOM - SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT,    249
       1969

       Benjamin, dressed, watching Caroline in her crib, asleep.
       Daisy in bed, asleep.

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                 I sold the summer house on Lake
                 Pontchartrain... I sold my share
                 of Button's Buttons... I sold the
                 sailboat... I put it all into an
                 account for your mother... And
                 before you would ever remember
                 me...

       And he bends to kiss his sleeping daughter, whispering to
       her...

                               BENJAMIN
                 I want you to know I love you...

      He stops to put a bank book on the dresser, along with a
      house key... the sound of the key is just enough for
      Daisy to stir. He starts to leave... He turns to go...
      and he sees Daisy is looking at him... A look not so much
      of anger, or hurt, not of resignation, but a look of
      acceptance... that this is what her life is now... He
      crosses out of the dark room silently closing the door
      behind him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I left, so that you and your
                   mother could have a life.

250   EXT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1969              250

      He takes the old motorcycle out of the garage.

                         (after a beat)
                   I left with just the clothes on my
                   back.

      He starts the motorcycle, and with just the shirt on his
      back he rides away...

251   INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE AT NIGHT,           251
      1969

      Daisy still lying in bed, the sound of the motorcycle
      driving away. She gets up. She takes the baby out of
      her crib and into bed with her, holding her baby in the
      bare light...

252   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              252

      Daisy, in her regal turban, silently looking out the
      window... the wind knocking loudly again...

                   I almost wish I didn't know any of
                   this.
                         (she's quiet, after a
                          beat)
                   I feel odd, reading...it...

      She looks at the book...

                   I don't know.    I never heard from
                   him.

      Caroline, distant, picks through the book...She comes
      upon...

                                 CAROLINE
                   There are postcards...

      Looking through them...

                   They're all addressed to me...
                   They're from all sorts of
                   places...

      And she realizes...

                   They're for my birthday.

                   Nothing I ever did will replace
                   that..."

      Daisy murmurs... Which brings Caroline back to the

       And Benjamin's voice comes in... WHILE WE SEE HIM IN
       VARIOUS PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD, A MONTAGE, A FILM
       WITHIN A FILM, OF THE ROAD HE'S TAKEN...

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

                 early, to be whoever you want to
                 be...There's no time limit, start
                 anytime you want...change or stay
                 the same...there aren't any
                 rules...We can make the best or
                 worst of it...I hope you make the

                 startle you. Feel things you
                 never felt before. I hope you

                 you start all over again."

       When we come out of those images...

252B   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT         252B

       Caroline finishes reading...

                               CAROLINE
                 "... I hope you start all over
                 again..."

       It's quiet...just the wind knocking...She looks at her
       mother...but Daisy's staring, somewhere else...

                               CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                      (takes up reading

263    INT. THE DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1980    263

       A record's playing piano music. Classes are done.
       Parents taking their children. We see Daisy, in her long
       skirt... helping pick up with her hands and her nimble
       toes, errant clothing, the jackets, the sweaters...




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                    165.

      It takes us a moment to recognize her... in the some
      twelve years since we've last seen her, 56 now, her
      hair's cut short... and it's gone mostly gray... and,
      although her age is on her face, she still has a dancer's
      posture, her head held high... carrying herself with
      grace... and one thing that will never change, are her
      unforgettable blue eyes... We hear the door opening...
      Daisy, busy gathering, saying her goodnights... glances
      toward the door across the studio... And she sees a young
      Man has come in, a young man in his twenties... standing
      silently, a stranger, standing by the door... Daisy, as
      she closes up the studio, makes her way toward him,
      saying goodnight to people... she bends to pick up a
      ballet slipper...

                                 DAISY
                   Somebody left their slipper...

      Daisy looks over, the young Man hasn't moved... the
      studio has all but emptied... she walks toward him...
      he's wearing worn trousers, a coat that's seen better
      days...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you here to pick someone up?

      He shakes "no." Coming closer....

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm sorry, we're closed now.

      She moves to open the door to show him out... when she
      gets a good look at him. She stops, realizing who it
      is...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin?

      ...and she's taken aback by his youth, we all are...
      sixteen years younger... in his 20s now... it's at once
      staggering and heartbreaking... what age can do... And
      she realizes, at that very moment, he was right all
      along...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You're so young.

      They look at each other... When she's able to find the
      words...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Why did you come back?

                              BENJAMIN
                I wanted to see you both.

      She stares at him... just the piano music. And despite
      the gulf of time... there's a terrible aching they have
      for each other... and before they can say anything... the
      door swings open and Caroline, 12, comes hurrying in...

                              CAROLINE
                You ready, Mom?

      Benjamin stares at her appearance... And Daisy, can't
      help herself, and seeing Caroline, Daisy, overcome by it
      all, starts to cry.

                              CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                Is something wrong, Mother?

                              DAISY
                No... He was telling me a very sad
                story about a mutual friend we
                hadn't seen in a long time... This
                is my friend, Benjamin... you knew
                him when you were... just a
                baby...

                              CAROLINE
                Hi...

                              BENJAMIN
                Hello...

      He reaches, taking her hand... needing to touch her...

                              A MAN'S    (V.O.)
                Hello...

      And a Man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in...

                              THE MAN
                I'm sorry... I thought you were
                done...

                              DAISY
                This is a friend of my family's...
                Benjamin Button... this is my
                husband... Robert...

      They shake hands... There's an awkward quiet...

                              ROBERT
                It was nice to have met you...
                We'll be in the car, darling...

                I'm just closing up...

      And Robert and Caroline go outside to wait for her...

                              BENJAMIN
                She's so lovely... she looks like
                you... Does she dance?

                                 DAISY
                Not very well.

                              BENJAMIN
                I suppose that would be from my
                side of things.

                              `DAISY
                She's a dear sweet girl... she
                seems a little lost... But who
                isn't a little lost at 12?
                There's a lot of her that reminds
                me of you.

      And she shuts off a set of the lights.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                My husband. He's a doctor... was
                a widower... He's an incredibly
                bright, adventurous man...

      Benjamin smiles.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                He's been a terrific father... and
                a great partner and friend...

      And she shuts off the record player and another set of
      lights... and for a moment they stand in the dark
      studio... and they look at their reflections in the
      mirror... seeing who they are now...

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                You're so much younger.

                              BENJAMIN
                Just what you can see.

      She looks at him, and after all these years... she now
      understands completely... she looks outside at her
      daughter standing by the car with her "father,"
      waiting...

                               DAISY
                 You ware right. She needed a
                 father. I couldn't have raised
                 both of you. I'm not that strong.

      He's quiet.   They both are.   She looks at him.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 I never thought how it must have
                 broken your heart, too.

      His silence is enough.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 Where are you staying? What are
                 you going to do?

                               BENJAMIN
                 I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on
                 the avenue. I have no idea what
                 I'm going to do.

      And it seems like they want to hold each other. But they
      can't. It's still. And aware of the car's headlights
      waiting at the curb... she turns, holding the door open
      for him...

                                 DAISY
                 I have to go.

      He nods.   He walks by her, going out.

264   EXT. A STREET, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980                         264

      She stops to lock the door. She turns, getting into the
      car... and leaves... Benjamin stands on the corner, hands
      in his pockets, the car driving by him... and Daisy can't
      help but look at him... and then the car's gone... and as
      he crosses the street and walks off into the night...

                   Is there anything we need to do?

                                 THE NURSE
                   Arrangements are being made to
                   move people if we have to. I'll
                   let you know as soon as we know
                   anything.

      She leaves hurriedly.

                                 DAISY
                   Please tell me what he says?

      Caroline looks at the book.       And Benjamin's voice comes
      in...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   "That night..."

266   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980            266

      Benjamin, sitting on the end of the bed, not sure why he
      came there at all... There's a sound at the door...as if
      somebody was there...

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Hello?

      Its quiet...a hesitancy...He starts to get up and there's
      a knock on the door...He opens it...and Daisy's there.
      He's startled to see her...

                                    DAISY
                   May I come in?

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Please...

      She comes inside...an awkward quiet...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I don't know what I'm doing
                   here...What I expected...?

      It echoes how she's feeling being there...They stand not
      knowing what to say...And Daisy says, sadly...

                                    DAISY
                   Nothing lasts.

      He puts a finger to her lips. He shakes "no."       And what
      he's come to know, that some things do last...

                   I never once stopped loving you...

      He affectionately pushes a hair off of her forehead...

                                 DAISY
                   I'm an old woman now, Benjamin.

                   Benjamin...

      He kisses her... and she's quiet... and he undresses
      her... undressing himself... and they stand momentarily
      naked... the young man and the older woman.

                                   DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you sure?

                   Some things you don't ever

                   ... the smell...

      Daisy turning... to look back... waving to him. Benjamin
      waving to her... what they both somehow know, is a last

                                 CAROLINE
                   That's the last thing he wrote...

      Daisy's quiet... they both are... alone with their
      thoughts...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   What happened to him after that
                   last time with you, Mother?

      The wind has picked up considerably, rattling the window
      even harder..

                                 DAISY
                   A year or so after your father
                   passed... There was a call...

269   INT. DAISY'S HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990               269

      And we see Daisy in her bathrobe, in her sixties...
      drinking a cup of coffee... the telephone rings...

                                 DAISY
                   Hello?... Yes?... Speaking -- I
                   don't understand? Where was that?

270   INT. A TAXI, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990                       270

      We see Daisy riding in the back or a taxi.

                                 DAISY
                   It's the last house...

      She looks outside, and we see up ahead of her, the Nolan
      House standing like a monument to time...

271   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE - DAY, 1990                             271

      Daisy gets out. The taxi drives off. Daisy stops for a
      moment before she opens the gate. The house has fallen
      into disrepair. A solitary old man sits on the porch
      rocking and rocking. She goes up the walk and out of
      habit goes around the back porch... to the kitchen...
      going inside...

272   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE DAY, 1990                               272

      She comes into the kitchen. She moves down the hallway
      into the living room... The interior has also fallen on
      hard times. Some old people are still in residence --
      predominantly African Americans now... Queenie's
      daughter, now in her fifties herself, stands in the
      living room... Along with a plain Man in a plain suit...

                                  DAISY
                   I'm Daisy...

      The Man turns...

                                 THE MAN
                   Thank you for coming... I'm David
                   Hernandez with the Orleans Parish
                   department of Child Welfare
                   Services.

      Queenie's daughter turns on a lamp... it doesn't work...
      she crosses the room to turn on another...

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   He was found living in a condemned
                   building off of east Lamont... the
                   police found this with him... this
                   address... and your name...

      And he gives her the journal...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      173.

272   CONTINUED:                                                      272

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   He was in very poor health... he
                   was taken to the hospital... He
                   doesn't seem to know who or where
                   he is... He's very confused... The
                   doctors who looked at him think he
                   may be autistic.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   I told Mr. Hernandez about
                   Benjamin bein' one of us. I told
                   him if he needs a place to stay...
                   it's alright... he can stay
                   here... he is blood after all...

      And just then we hear a PIANO playing... as if it were
      being played by a child... with no skill... banging as
      much as anything... And Daisy follows the sound of the
      piano into the parlor...

273   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1990                            273

      And she sees his back... just a boy of 12 now... hunched
      over... trying to play the piano... trying to play the
      tune the woman had taught to him...

                                 DAISY
                   Benjamin.

      He turns at the sound of her voice. There is no
      indication he recognizes her at all.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   Do you know this song?

      And he tries to play what he thinks is the song, but is
      nothing more than a child playing random notes.

                                 DAISY
                   You play really beautifully.

      She comes and touches his back... He shrinks from her
      touch.

                                 THE MAN
                   He doesn't seem to like to be
                   touched.

      And while he tries to play...

                                                                      174.

273   CONTINUED:                                                      273

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   The doctors said if they didn't
                   know any better, he goes in and
                   out of states of recognition, as
                   if he had the beginnings of
                   dementia...

      Daisy's looking at the boy, who was once the man she
      loved... who she still loves... She looks into his
      eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   Do you remember me?   I'm Daisy.

      He looks at her.    No sense of recognition.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   Daisy is a very pretty name. I'm
                   Benjamin.

                                 DAISY
                   It's good to meet you Benjamin.
                   Do you mind if I sit with you? I
                   would love to hear you play.

      He doesn't say anything. She sits down beside him on the
      piano bench. He stops to look at her.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   There's something about you...
                   There's something about your eyes
                   I remember from a long time ago...

      He looks at her eyes. She looks at him... And as she
      sits with him on the piano bench... as he tries to
      play... Daisy and Benjamin, "together again..."

274   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              274

                                 DAISY
                   Queenie's daughter saw to it that
                   he was taken care of...

275   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1994                   275

      And we see Benjamin, just eight now... coming into the
      kitchen... Queenie's daughter cleaning up after
      breakfast.

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   I want some breakfast.

                                                                       175.

275   CONTINUED:                                                       275

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   You just ate breakfast.

                                    BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   No I didn't...

                                 AN OLD WOMAN
                   You just finished eating, Mr.
                   Button.

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   You think I don't know what you
                   are doing?

      And like an eight year old, or an old man old with onset
      Alzheimer's -- which makes him nearly a helpless child,
      he starts to rage... throwing things...

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT (CONT'D)
                   You are all fucking liars!

                                  DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   And every day I would stop by...
                   and make sure he was
                   comfortable...

      And just then Daisy comes into the kitchen.       She sees him
      raging.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   He doesn't believe he's already
                   had his breakfast.

                                 DAISY
                   Let's see if we can find something
                   else for you to do.

                                  BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                         (upset, meaning
                          lapses)
                   I can't help it. I can't help
                   this.

                                 DAISY
                   I know you can't.

      And as she puts her arm around him, taking him out of the
      room, understanding...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   Many times he would simply forget
                   who and where he was at all...

                                                                   176.



276   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY                      276

      We see Daisy sitting on a bed with Benjamin in his room
      on the second floor of the old house... And he's oddly
      lucid...more articulate than his age would indicate...

                              BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                I get the feeling there's a lot of
                things I can't remember...

                              DAISY
                What do you mean?

                              BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                It's like there's this whole life
                I had and I can't remember what it
                was...

      He's frustrated by it...

                              DAISY
                It's alright... It's alright to
                forget things...

      And as she sits on his bed with him... in the upstairs
      room...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                It wasn't easy...

277   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1996                                 277

      And we see Benjamin, no more than six now, standing on
      the ROOF... Daisy standing on the ground down below
      him...

                              DAISY
                     (nervous)
                I wish you'd come down...

                              BENJAMIN AT SIX
                     (a little boy)
                I can see everything.

      And he points out...

                              BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D)
                I can see the big river... all the
                boats... I can see the graveyard
                where mama's buried and all those
                other people... I can see the
                city... where you have your
                dancing place...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      177.

277   CONTINUED:                                                      277

      And tears fill Daisy's eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   You're right, you can see
                   everything sweetheart...

      And he can... he can see all the way across to the
      Mississippi River... the old graveyard... the city... his
      whole life...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I think you better come down...

                                 BENJAMIN AT SIX
                   What if I could fly?

      And it looks like he might just try...

                                 DAISY
                        (stopping him)
                   I knew a man who could fly. Come
                   down and I'll tell you all about
                   him.

      He's quiet, thinking about that. And acquiescing, he
      turns up the roof out of sight... some short
      moments...and he comes running out the front door... his
      hands in his pockets like the brave little man he is...
      Daisy bends down... and as he runs into her arms... Daisy
      holding him...

278   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              278

      Daisy propped in her bed looking out the window...

                                 DAISY
                   And I went to take care of him...

279   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1997                                    279

      And we see Daisy, in her seventies now, carrying a
      suitcase, coming up the walkway, and onto the porch...
      old people sitting in the porch chairs...

                                  DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   He was five, I think, when I moved
                   in... the same age I was when I
                   had met him...

      And we see Benjamin, 5 now, sitting on the porch swing,
      staring off... and he drools like a helpless old man.
      Daisy stops, taking out a handkerchief, wiping the drool
      off his chin...

                   How would you like to help me
                   unpack?

280   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1997                   280

      Daisy, unpacking her suitcase with Benjamin's help,
      taking out an alarm clock, a quilt, some photographs...
      The "Just So Book.." Her personal things... moving in...
      Benjamin, playing with the alarm clock, making the alarm
      go off... again, and again...

281   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1997                 281

      Benjamin in a small child's bed. Daisy, sitting on his
      bed reading from Kipling's "Just So" stories to him...

                                 DAISY
                   This is the picture of old Man
                   Kangaroo at five in the afternoon,
                   when he got his beautiful hind
                   legs just as Big God Ngong had
                   promised.

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   The days passed...

282   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, THE FALL, 2000                  282

      And we see Benjamin, just three or so now, holding
      Daisy's hand, walking with her in some autumn leaves...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   I watched as he forgot how to
                   talk...

283   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 2001                            283

      Benjamin almost two... sitting On Daisy's lap in the
      front room... and saying...

                                 BENJAMIN AT ONE
                   Benjamin...
                        (points to her)
                   Daisy...

                                 DAISY
                   That's right... Benjamin and
                   Daisy...

      Proud of himself he smiles...

284   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, FALL, 2001            284

      And we see him, just like a toddler, barely able to
      stand... Daisy there to catch him from falling...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                I watched him sleep...

285   EXT. PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE DAY, 2002                      285

      Daisy, sitting on the porch on a rocking chair. Benjamin,
      just a baby now, some months old, sleeping in her lap...

                              DAISY'S (V.0,)
                In 2002, they put a new clock on
                the train station wall...

286   INT. TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY 2002                    286

      And we see a workman on a ladder taking down the old
      clock of "Mr. Cake's"... handing it down to another
      workman...and putting up a new clock... a digital
      clock... The time moving... the way it's meant to be...
      going forward...

287   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT            287

      Daisy in her hospital bed... the wind howling at the
      window...

                In the spring of 2003...

288   INT. BENJAMIN AND DAISY'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 2003       288

      Shadows dapple the room. Daisy sitting in    an old chair
      in the middle of the room... with daylight   streaming in
      on her... holding Benjamin on her lap... a   tiny thing
      now... nearly newborn... he can almost fit   in her two old
      hands...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                He looked at me...

      And we see him looking up at her...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                He looked into my eyes...

                   with his little thumb he held my
                   thumb...

      ...and that's just what he does... looking into Daisy's
      eyes...holding her thumb with his tiny hand...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   And as he had said... no matter
                   what age he was... he was the same
                   person behind his eyes... and, at
                   that moment I knew... he knew who
                   I was...

      The baby staring into her blue eyes...

                   And then he closed his eyes like
                   he was sleeping...

      And we see his eyes flutter and softly close... forever.
      And as he lays in his beloved Daisy's lap... completely
      still...

289   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              289

      The wind a full out hurricane.    The lights flicker.   Stay
      on.

                                 CAROLINE
                   I'm going to see what they want us
                   to do...

      And as she gets up, the "book" drops on the floor.      And a
      card's fallen out. Caroline picks it up.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   It's a train schedule.

      She turns it over.    There's writing.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   "I'm on a train in India filled
                   with people."

290   INT. A TRAIN SOMEWHERE IN INDIA - LATE AT NIGHT                 290

      An overcrowded train car... people sitting and standing

      available space, nook and cranny, asleep.

                   I'm the only one who isn't
                   sleeping...

      Now we see Benjamin sitting on the floor among all of the
      people, the only one awake, writing on the back of the
      train schedule.

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   "I figured out one thing. If
                   you're growing older or getting
                   younger it really doesn't make any
                   difference. Whichever way you're
                   going you have to make the most of
                   what this is."

      He looks at all the people sleeping around him...
      strangers on a train...

      Daisy nods. Caroline goes out of the room... It's quiet.
      Daisy's alone now... looking out the window... at the
      howling, hurricane... a hundred mile an hour fury... And
      fighting against the wind, trying to reach the window is
      a hummingbird... it almost makes it and is pushed back by
      the gale... but undaunted, its wings doing a figure
      eight... the symbol for infinity... it fights its way
      through the wind to the window... tapping at the
      window... and the hummingbird flies away... she watches
      it go... and after some moments she says...

                                 DAISY
                   Goodnight, Benjamin...

      A storage room. Old track signs. Old waiting room

"Dark City", early, by Alex Proyas



   












                              DARK CITY

                                 by
                             Alex Proyas







                            REVISED DRAFT
                         November 29th, 1992





     DARKNESS

     A LOW RUMBLE increases in volume.


     FADE UP:

     A BLACK-GLOVED HAND wraps around a bulky electrical lever,
     thrusts FORWARD.

     SNAP!  -  Electricity arcs through darkness.

     O.S. sound of MACHINERY turning ON.

     TITLES OVER

     MONTAGE OF CLOCKS starting  -  various.  Second hands turn  -
     TICKING gets louder.


     INT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT

     SHADOWS DANCE.  A bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing:
     clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor...

     SLEEPING EYES in and out of darkness.  The eyes open.
     Confusion.

     WIDEN ANGLE ON JONATHAN WHITE  -  a man in his early thirties,
     dark featured.

     He sits up.  Water splashes.  He's in a tub of long cold water.
     His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever.

     He looks down into the murky water around him.  A feint
     movement beneath the surface, something swimming  -  A SMALL
     DARK SHAPE.  Startled, he leaps from the bath.

     ANGLE  -  THE SWINGING LIGHT BULB.  The man's hand reaches up,
     stops the light-bulb mid swing.

     He steps to a circular window.  The glass is cracked, covered
     in grime.  He wipes it, this only smears the dirt.

     It's dark out there.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  from outside the window, through blurry
     glass.

     A RAPID FLYING P.O.V. PULLS BACK in silence.  The window is a
     SPECK on the side of a vast grey tower.

     BACK IN THE BATHROOM

     White shivers, cold.  He stares down at the puddle he drips on
     the floor.  He looks at his feet and legs, covered with
     numerous SMALL BITES.  He dries the bloody wounds with a towel.

     He picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on.
     Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with
     HOLES in both soles.  In his trouser pocket he finds a key  -
     a room number on a plastic tag.

     He hears splashing in the bath-tub.  He steps over, looks into
     the murky water.  Suddenly a SMALL SILVER FISH leaps from the
     water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about.

     He leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the
     water.

     Like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the
     shadows.  He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand
     inches from the doorknob.  He leans down.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYE

     Blinking through the key-hole.

     P.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM  -  A glimpse of motion  -  the door
     across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM  -  NIGHT

     WHITE pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room.

     No sign of life.  Cheap decorations.  He walks around
     cautiously.  Turns lights on.  Then reconsiders.  Turns them off
     again.  Disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror.

     ANGLE ON OPEN BATHROOM DOOR  -  the fish has jumped from the tub
     again and is flapping on the floor.

     White steps back into the bathroom.  He picks up the fish again,
     doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket.

     BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM

     He searches through things.  A grey overcoat in the closet.  He
     goes through the pockets, finds a WALLET.  No I.D., just a
     laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea-side town.

     ANGLE ON A REVOLVER on the bed-side table.  He picks it up, his
     grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the
     trigger and...

     BANG!

     The gun goes off.  A BULLET RICOCHETS wildly around the room,
     bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself
     in the wall.

     Startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off
     again.  He examines it carefully now.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Five bullets left.

     He turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the
     inside pocket of the coat.

     He moves to the bed.  A RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH on the rug.  A
     fragment of a woman's face, her left eye.  He lifts the
     fragment up.  There's handwriting on the back, part of a note:

               ...MEANS THE MOST TO ME.  LOVE YOU
               FOREVER.  -  E...

     The rest is missing.

     He sits on the edge of the bed.  As he does this, he notices
     something else on the floor.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  follows a dark stain on the floorboards, to a
     woman's bare foot behind the bed.  He stands abruptly, fumbles
     across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room.

     In the shadows he can make out a woman's naked BODY lying in a
     pool of blood.  Her eyes stare lifeless.

     White stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his
     mouth.


     INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White stumbles from the room, leans against a wall for support.

     Lights flicker.

     At the end of the corridor, elevator doors open.  Light and
     musak flood out.


     INT.  LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     White staggers from the elevator, moves past a deserted front
     desk.  A VOICE from the back room:

                         HOTEL MANAGER O.S.
               Hey, you! You gotta message.

     White stops, looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain.

                         WHITE
               What?

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Message in d'box!  You deaf?

     White sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him.
     Reaching across the desk, he glances through the bead curtain
     into the manager's office.  TELEVISION SOUNDS O.S.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Hard to see  -  the man sits in the chair, lit by the glow of
     the T.V. set.  White grabs the note, looks at it.  A PHONE
     NUMBER, also his room number, and what appears to be his name:
     JONATHAN WHITE.  That's all.  White thrusts the message in his
     pocket.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Got my money?

                         WHITE
               What?  I...  How long have I been
               here?

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Jeez, too damn long if you ask me!
               What about the two weeks y'owe me...

     Totally confused, White turns to leave, sees something.  Stops.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A painting on a wall (cheap print variety)  -
     waves on a beach.  A breeze rustles the pages of a calender,
     pinned beside the picture.
   
     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  MOVE IN on his ear.  O.S. SOUND  -  surf
     crashes on shore.  A WOMAN'S VOICE WHISPERS:

                         VOICE O.S.
               What is your name...  What is your
               name...

     He backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic
     -  sees a sign:  TOILETS.  A painted hand points the way.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Hey!

                         WHITE (without turning)
               I'll be back later.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Yeah.  Well, y'better be.
          
     CAMERA REVEALS A FIGURE  -  watching from a shadowy corner of
     the lobby.

     As White runs out, the MYSTERY MAN picks up a pay-phone, dials.
     Whispers into the receiver in a foreign language.


     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White pushes shakily through a red door, runs down a corridor.
     Pipes steam and drip water.  He rounds a corner, slips, nearly
     falls.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM  -  NIGHT

     Puddles on the floor, stains on the walls.

     White bursts through the door and into a cubicle.  He bends
     over a toilet bowl and VOMITS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     He looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve.  A breeze tugs at
     his stringy hair.  A tiny ventilation grill above the cistern
     looks out at the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  OUTSIDE

     Sheets of newspaper blow past.  A full moon, surrounded by
     blood red clouds, hangs above empty streets.


     INT.  CINEMA  -  NIGHT

     A WATCH  -  on a hairy wrist.  Seconds tick past.  Soft
     flickering light.  VOICES O.S.

     ANGLE ON FRANK BUMSTEAD  -  police inspector.  He looks down at
     the watch.  Time to leave.  He STANDS, heads for an illuminated
     exit sign.

     Images flicker on a SCREEN.  The inspector rushes to the door,
     runs into an USHER, who gasps.

                         BUMSTEAD (to usher)
               Gesundheit!

     Bumstead quickly moves off.


     INT.  CINEMA LOBBY

     The INSPECTOR makes a call, licks the tip of a pencil,
     scribbles in a notebook.  Behind thick glass, he argues
     soundlessly into a phone.

     BIG IN FOREGROUND  -  a popcorn machine rattles noisily.

     INSIDE THE BOOTH

     The inspector is upset, face strained.  A MALE VOICE chatters
     quickly through the receiver.

                         BUMSTEAD (cuts in)
               ...but you told me the meeting was
               ten-thirty.

     A burst of chatter.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I know, sir, but I can't make it at
               nine-thirty...  It's  -  um  -  well,
               inconvenient...

     A stream of chatter stops him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir...  I understand...  Yes...
               But, I've done fine so far without an
               assistant...

     The inspector tries to interject as the VOICE cuts in again...

                         BUMSTEAD
               But...  But I...  I...
                    (defeated)
               Nine-thirty.  Yes.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM

     We are underwater.  WHITE's FACE swims into view.  Bubbles spew
     from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror.

     ANGLE ON MEN'S ROOM

     White washes his face in a sink.  He looks up, wipes his face
     dry with his coat.  He turns towards the door to leave.

     There are TWO  -  identical.  He cannot remember which he came
     through.  Takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness.

     He realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but
     the door CLICKS behind him:  locked.


     INT.  CONCRETE TUNNEL

     Pitch black.  Trickling water.  A distant voice over a P.A.
     system recites names, followed by numbers.  A LIGHT, far away.
     White walks towards it.

     He steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a
     blank wall.  He pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the
     slot, dials the number on his message.  Ringing  -  no answer.

     Suddenly White feels cold.

                         VOICE O.S.
               There you are.

     Startled, White drops the phone and turns.  A figure moves
     forward out of darkness:

     ANGLE ON THE MYSTERY MAN from the hotel lobby.  The stranger
     wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale
     skin.  He is completely bald.  He studies White carefully.

     White glances about nervously  -  walks back up the corridor,
     his eyes pinned to the man.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You are lost, yes?

     White retreats faster.

     A FLASH OF STEEL  -  a dagger appears by the stranger's side,
     gripped in a black leather glove.  He moves forward, a grin on
     his pale face.

     White stops, backs against the wall.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               Co-operate.  Do not make this
               difficult.

     White panics  -  he's cornered.  He remembers the revolver.  He
     pulls it from his coat and LEVELS it at the stranger, his hand
     shakes terribly.

     ON THE STRANGER continuing to advance.  Something about his
     eyes makes White immobile, unable to think clearly.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You will not shoot, yes.  There is a
               place in your mind, a corner of
               darkness...

     THE GUN FIRES again and again.  Red splashes appear on the man.
     His shoulder.  His leg.  His neck.  He walks forward, with
     spastic jerks as bullets RIP into him.

     A final shot POINT BLANK into the stranger's forehead.  A
     stream of black liquid spouts from the hole.

     Blue smoke clears.  The man stands motionless, his mouth hangs
     open.  Then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground.


     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     CLICKING of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles.
     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD strides down a silent corridor.  He reaches
     into his pocket, removes a SURGICAL MASK, places it over his
     nose and mouth.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at
     the end of the corridor.  The man, who is dressed identically
     to the inspector, is his superior:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good evening, sir.

                         STROMBOLI
               Yes.  This way.

     STROMBOLI leads the inspector into a tiled room containing
     several COVERED BODIES.  The two men are greeted by a cheerful-
     looking MORTICIAN.

                         MORTICIAN
               Welcome, gentlemen.  Youíre early.
               Here for the examination, right?

     Stromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the
     row of corpses.  Bumstead follows.

                         STROMBOLI
               The handiwork of an extremely sick
               individual.

     He throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations.

                         STROMBOLI
               Youíve read the reports.  Not much to
               go on.  We know nothing about him,
               except that he likes to cut them...
               Always the same type of blade.
               Forensics match in each case...
               Anyway, it's all in the reports, read
               them for yourself.

     STROMBOLI shakes his head, turns away from the final body,
     looks at the inspector.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why are you wearing that thing on
               your face?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Germs, sir.  These places are full of
               them.

                         STROMBOLI
               I see.
                    (continues)
               One thingís for sure, heís ambitious.
               Youíll be a busy man from now on.

                         MORTICIAN
               You can say that again.

     Stromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man.  The Mortician
     becomes serious and goes back to his work.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít
               this his case?

                         STROMBOLI
               Thompson suffered a kind of severe
               delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway
               he isnít with us any longer.  The
               case is yours.  Go through his files.
               Take what you need.
                    (less business-like)
               By the way, howís your mother?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...

                         STROMBOLI (cuts in)
               Very good...

     The chief-inspector turns, paces to the door briskly.

                         STROMBOLI
               Letís go, Bumstead.  So much to do
               and so little time.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     A large faded BILLBOARD advertisement on a building facade.  A
     portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "LUMP-
     O"  -  a cereal box carton.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY, rises upwards, CLOSER on the
     womanís face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her
     PAINTED IRIS.


     INT.  STAIR-WELL

     A raftered room on the other side of the billboard.  CAMERA
     TILTS TO a convoluted staircase  -  at the base, the SHADOW OF
     A MAN runs.

     FEET pace rapidly.  TILT UP TO REVEAL  -  WHITE.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS as he tries to lose himself from possible
     pursuers.  He steps through a low archway into a back alley,
     rounds a corner.

     A DEAD-END.  White stops, looks around, then up.  Heís breathing
     heavily, trying to catch his breath.  He starts to shake.

     ABOVE, the walls stretch into darkness.  An OPENING way up
     there  -  he can see stars.  Something dark crosses the gap of
     sky.  A RUSHING NOISE in the distance.  Wind starts to pick up.

     Trash is being kicked up.  A sheet of NEWSPAPER wraps around
     Whiteís leg.  He tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonít
     come off.  He bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but
     something grabs his eye.

     He stares at the page for a moment  -  then his LEGS SLIP from
     under him and he falls to the ground.  He holds his head like
     itís going to explode.  A whimper deep in his throat.  His body
     is trembling violently.

     PUSH IN TIGHT on the paper on the ground.  A front-page
     headline:  MAN-HUNT CONTINUES FOR SERIAL KILLER!

     White looks up  -  terrified.  The RUSHING NOISE O.S. again.

     HIS P.O.V.

     ON THE WALL facing him, a DOOR has appeared where moments
     before there was nothing.  The door creaks open to reveal
     ANOTHER DOOR WITHIN.  This one extends outwards on the end of a
     lengthening wooden shaft.

     White, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket.
     Tries to side-step the ADVANCING DOOR but itís too late, he can
     only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the
     wall.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     HAND-HELD P.O.V. THROUGH the swaying beads hanging in the back-
     room doorway.  TWO FIGURES peer into the room.

                         FIGURE 1
               We are looking for Jonathan White.

     THE HOTEL MANAGER looks up, moves forward into light:  a squat,
     hunch-backed man with glasses.  He steps through the beads,
     glares at the intruders.

                         MANAGER
               What for?

     ON THE MEN  -  an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to
     kill White.  Black coats, glasses, pale skin.  Creepy.

     A BLACK GLOVED HAND flashes forward, grips the managerís face
     and doesnít let go.  The manager struggles, gulps for air.
     Heís pushed back heavily against the wall.

                         MAN 1
               Which room is he in?

     The leather glove SQUEEZES, blood trickles from the managerís
     ears, through the fingers.


     INT.  ROOM 43

     ANOTHER (VERY SHORT) FIGURE is searching the room.  He hears
     NOISES O.S. in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against
     the wall.

     ON THE MAN  -  FREDRICK  -  a stunted body, an oversized head,
     thick limbs.  The rest of his features lost in shadow.

     The door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room.

     ON THE TWO MYSTERY MEN as they step in and look around.  They
     search the room, knock stuff over.  One of the men kicks at the
     womanís corpse in the corner.  Behind him, Fredrick, still
     hiding near the door, slips into the corridor unnoticed.


     EXT.  FLYING P.O.V.  -  NIGHT

     A FLYING PERSPECTIVE past buildings.  An INSECT-LIKE BUZZING
     O.S.  Way down BELOW, in a canyon of silent buildings, a LONE
     FIGURE walks.


     EXT.  DOWN ON THE STREET

     A breeze pulls at WHITEís hair and coat.  He takes out the
     wallet  -  a few dollars.

     HIS P.O.V. AS HE WALKS

     The city is DEAD.  Empty.  Desolate.  Buildings hang down out
     of black.  Day-time was never invented.

     As he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a BUSINESS CARD he
     hadnít noticed, flutters to the ground.  He stops, picks it up.
     In simple print:  DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D., a phone number.
     Scribbled handwriting on the back says:  Thursday 0930.

     ON WHITE  -  he glances across the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A cafe.  A broken NEON FISH buzzes above the
     doorway.


     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     He walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six
     tables.  Empty.  Dirty.  He sits and waits.

     A CLOCK ticks on the wall  -  midnight.  White coughs, for
     attention.

     A NOISE from a doorway.  A SHADOW moves towards him, dragging
     one foot as it walks.  A SMALL ASIAN WOMAN appears and limps to
     his table.  She speaks very quickly IN CHINESE.  He does not
     understand.

     She points to a chalk board on the wall  -  a list of dishes
     also in Chinese, only one in English  -  the last one.  At the
     bottom.  In small print.  "NOODLES".

                         WHITE (nods)
               The noodles.  Iíll have some noodles.

     The old woman rips a YELLOW TICKET from a pad, gives it to
     White.  A number on it.  She points her crooked finger again
     at a SPEAKER BOX above a small serving window in the wall.  A
     greenish fluoro pulses from the room within.

                         WOMAN
               We call.

     She leaves again.

     White looks about the empty room.  Insects are zapped on an
     illuminated DEVICE hanging on the wall.  An old air-conditioner
     RATTLES noisily.

     NOISES from the kitchen  -  voices argue in Chinese, a baby
     cries.  Then SILENCE.

     White removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the
     table.

     He overcomes his fear, starts to read the article.  Leans
     forward, hands trembling.  Without realising, he holds the
     paper OVER A CANDLE burning on the table.  The paper CATCHES
     FIRE, is engulfed.  He drops the flaming page on the table.  Now
     the table-cloth starts to burn.

     White is frantic.  On a nearby table he finds a pitcher of
     water, and dumps this on the flames.  It kills the fire but
     leaves a black hole in the table-cloth.  The paper is ash.

     He moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the
     smoke away.


     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD is moving quickly.  He suddenly trips and falls to the
     floor.  He curses under his breath, then looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A door  -  THOMPSON:  DETECTIVE/INSPECTOR on the frosted glass.
     Bumstead stands, pushes into the office.

     INSIDE
 
     A total mess  -  paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee
     cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags.  Bumstead shakes his
     head.

                         BUMSTEAD
               A real shame...

     He starts to look around.

     TIGHT ON FILING CABINET  -  a drawer is pulled open.
     Thompsonís files are also a mess.  Bumstead continues to shake
     his head.  He reaches for a file.  A loud SNAP!

                         BUMSTEAD (screams)
               YAAAAAAAAAH!

     He recoils.  A mousetrap has snapped over his fingers.  He
     pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing.


     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     White is still waiting for his food.

     He leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg
     to examine the bites  -  worse, inflamed.  He uses a napkin to
     wipe at the pus.

     AERIAL PERSPECTIVE OF A FLY  -  circling the room, looking down
     on White.

     ON THE FLY  -  It lands on a plate of half eaten food on
     another table.  The creature is some kind of SURVEILLANCE
     DEVICE  -  half insect/half machine.  Itís spying on him.  MOVE
     IN TIGHT as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head.  It shits
     on the food behind it.

     White is oblivious to this.  Heís finished examining his leg,
     is sitting quietly.  He yawns.  His head nods forward briefly.

     A NOISE.  White looks up.

     A TRAP-DOOR has opened in the ceiling.  Two feet in black
     leather shoes descend from the hole.  A sea breeze blows
     through the room.  The SOUND OF SURF, SEAGULLS CRYING.

     ON Whiteís nose twitching.  He can smell the ocean.

     The WALLPAPER COMES ALIVE  -  like a seething tangle of worms.

     One by one, THREE MEN in black coats lower into the room,
     floating on air.  They pull out knifes, step forward.

     ON WHITE rigid with terror.

     ON THE MEN  -  though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the
     gloom, they too resemble the MAN who confronted White earlier.
     They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads.
     Ready to attack.  They lean over him, pause dramatically.

                         MAN 1
               Donít fall asleep.
                    (chuckles softly)
               Might never wake, yes.

     This Man turns to the others.  They all smile, then turn back
     to White.

                         MEN (in unison)
               Fifty-six.

     ANOTHER VOICE has been speaking softly  -  now it is louder.
     Repeating:

                         VOICE
               Fifty-six...  Fifty-six...

     ANGLE  -  a chair falls to the floor.

     White leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented.  Just a
     DREAM  -  he had dozed.

     WIDEN ANGLE  -  The place is still empty.  White glances to the
     serving window.  A DISH waits for him, framed in the glowing
     fluoro square.  He gets it.  A bowl of soupy liquid with
     noodles.  He sits down.

     He is about to start eating  -  realizes he has a fork instead
     of a spoon.  Picking up the bowl again, he heads to the
     kitchen.


     INT.  CORRIDOR

     He takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds
     himself in another corridor.  He looks about, unsure which
     direction to go in.


     INT.  SERIES OF ROOMS  -  LATER

     White is lost, still holding the soup.

     He moves through a number of RUSTED METAL DOORS that open and
     shut automatically.  Each reveals another room or corridor.
     Deserted spaces long forgotten  -  dusty, crumbling.

     He feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and
     looks at it.

     White holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup
     in the other.  Disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl.


     INT.  CORRIDOR

     A TICKING SOUND O.S.

     White stops.  Looks up.  A large clock suspended from the
     rafters.  A tug at his coat.

     Standing beside him is FREDRICK  -  the little man from Whiteís
     hotel room.

                         FREDRICK (stutters)
               Where have you been?  The doctorís
               been worried about you.

                         WHITE
               What?  Who are you?

     Fredrick looks nervously down the corridor.

                         FREDRICK
               Címon, letís go!  We donít have any
               time.

     The little man grabs Whiteís sleeve, starts to pull him along.

                         WHITE
               Hold it a minute.  Letís start at the
               beginning, huh?

     ANGLE ON  -  the top of a set of stairs in front of them.  Two
     dark figures appear.

     Fredrick looks up at them in horror.

                         FRERICK
               Shit!
                    (looks at White)
               Quick!  Run!

     Both men run like crazy, White awkwardly holding the bowl of
     soup.  They come to a junction, each takes a separate corridor.
     Fredrick finds some stairs, climbs two at a time.

     White climbs INTO FRAME, looks around, finds another corridor.
     The little man is nowhere to be seen.  White reaches another
     junction  -  several corridors branch off.             

     HIS P.O.V. PANNING AROUND                   

     Each passageway completely deserted.        

                         WHITE
               Shit.                                       

     He keeps running.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

     A PHOTO FLASH  -  illuminates the dead body of the hotel manager,
     slumped in his own blood.

     Bumstead leans INTO FRAME, examines the corpse.  He notices
     several stab wounds in the manís abdomen.  Various cops search
     the room.

     One cop walks up to the Inspector.

                         COP
               We got another one upstairs

                         BUMSTEAD (deadpan)
               Great.


     INT.  ROOM  -  NIGHT

     A SMALL ROOM with arched windows that look over the city.
     Fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned
     table.

     He scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then
     puts it into a METAL CYLINDER he finds beneath the table also.

     He glances out a window, notices A FIGURE standing beneath a
     street-lamp below, looking up at him.  Startled, Fredrick darts
     back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen
     vertical PIPES running up into the ceiling.

     TIGHT ON ONE OF THE PIPES  -  he opens a small hatch and puts
     the metal cylinder in it.  The cylinder is snatched from his
     hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air.

     WIDER

     Fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief.  A shadow falls across
     his back.  He turns.  He screams.

     INT./EXT.  VARIOUS

     TIGHT  -  rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding
     speed.  The cylinder races around corners.  It clanks and
     grinds.  HURTLES up the side of a building.  THEN PLUMMETS
     underground.  Rushes through darkness.


     EXT.  BRIDGE  -  NIGHT

     THE CAMERA MOVES along a bridge-like structure.  An enclosed
     corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons.  Under the bridge,
     pipes spew sewage into stagnant water.

     ANGLE ON WHITE WALKING  -  seen through a series of illuminated,
     dirty, windows.  He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds
     before him.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of
     clattering metal.  A pipe runs the length of the corridor  -
     the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness.

     Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS
     somewhere in the building.  White hurriedly moves towards the
     source.

     ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE
     in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole
     in the wall and looks through.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room
     in a warm glow.

     White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the
     hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two
     dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of
     dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  itís Fredrick  -  just as
     both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He
     doesnít scream this time, just gags on blood running from his
     mouth.

     Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteís neck,
     traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free
     himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard
     floor, makes a mess.

     INSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing
     noise.

     BACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength.
     The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run
     away but glances at the floor.

     The fish is flapping about  -  still alive.


     EXT.  STREET

     White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the
     base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering
     above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance:
     LIBRARY.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop
     suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood
     blast away violently.

     BUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship.

     A HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled.

     ON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit!

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Sorry, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Donít ever sneak up on me like that!
               Who are you?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Patricia Crenshaw.

     She puts out her hand.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iím your new assistant.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I didnít requisition a secretary.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               The Chief-Inspector thought you might
               need a hand.

                         BUMSTEAD (uncertain)
               Oh.

     He takes her hand tentatively.  They shake.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iíve taken the liberty and had
               Inspector Thompsonís office searched,
               as I believe you instructed.  All
               clear now, sir.  They found several
               more traps and things were filed
               under pretty strange categories...
               Poor man.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               You wonít regret this, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Fine.

     Bumstead moves off.


     INT.  LIBRARY

     White steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign
     saying, SILENCE in formal letters.  The place seems abandoned,
     then he notices a hint of movement.  Cigarette smoke snakes
     into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor.

     He walks up to an elderly female LIBRARIAN sitting behind a
     desk, smoking, reading.  White looks somewhat distraught still.

                         WHITE
               Keep newspapers here, birth
               certificates, records of deaths, that
               kind of thing?

     The librarian looks up from her book.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Which would you like first?

                         WHITE
               Okay.  Newspapers.

     She takes her glasses off.  Her eyes are TINY, like pin-heads.
     She studies White.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Are you alright?

     He looks around  -  restrained panic.

                         WHITE (looks at the woman)
               Sure.  Iím fine.

                         LIBRARIAN (nods)
               Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the
               hall.  Third floor.  Turn left.
               Section C-7.  Row 35, near the
               toilets.

     She replaces her glasses, watches White rush away.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Donít mention it...

     She blows her nose into a handkerchief.  The snort ECHOES
     LOUDLY.


     INT.  LIBRARY CORRIDOR

     White rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues.  He
     finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with
     old volumes.  Comes to number 7.

     He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34
     but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc.

     No Row 35.

     He stops and looks around  -  sure enough a door displays a
     small sign:  TOILETS.

     White is sweating profusely.  He now sits on a chair, takes off
     his shoes, rubs his feet.  He pulls a book from a shelf behind
     him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out,
     folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes.

     He gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate
     diagram of the library interior.  An arrow points to a section
     near a wing labelled:  MAPS.  Near the arrow it says:  YOU ARE
     HERE.

     He keeps walking.

     He finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a
     sign is nailed to it:  WE ARE REMODELLING.  WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY
     INCONVENIENCE.

     White, annoyed now, tries to force his way in.  Puts his
     shoulder to the door, pushes several times.  It CRUMBLES under
     his weight  -  rotten.

     He finds himself in a DUSTY ROOM.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of
     old newspapers.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper
     off the shelf.  The instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust
     in his hands.  He picks up another, and another, each in turn
     breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES face each other across a polished black
     table.  They speak in a foreign language.  A phone rings.
     Figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively.

     Figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to
     lock together.  A complex puzzle.  He gets impatient with the
     puzzle, dashes it to the floor.

     Figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something.  Hands
     the note to Figure 2, who in turn drops it into A CHUTE.

     CONTROL ROOM

     The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 (in
     shadow yet again).  He reads from the note over a silver
     microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue.

     TIGHT ON A SPEAKER  -  his distorted voice.  A final mysterious
     person  -  Figure 4  -  listens to the announcement.  He takes
     a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a
     board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs.  The
     board resembles a planning table in a war-room.

     A HIGH ANGLE as the CAMERA PULL BACKS on the grouping of cut
     out figures.  More and more of them.  Ten.  Twenty.  A hundred.
     A sinister army.


     INT.  INTERSECTING STREET  -  NIGHT

     White is in a phone booth.  He removes the note from his
     pocket, dials.  No answer again.  He dials the OPERATOR.  A
     muffled voice over the line.

                         WHITE
               Iím trying to reach nine zero eight
               triple two.  I canít get through...
                    (beat)
               What?!...
                    (angry)
               Shit!

     He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a coin, puts it into the
     slot.  Heís sweating again.  He wipes his brow with a trembling
     hand.

                         WHITE
               It is?...  Which area is that number
               listed in?...  Is that near the
               ocean?...  The ocean...  Never mind.
               Have a Jonathan White listed?...
               WHITE.  Seventeen?  All Johns?  I
               see...  Never mind.

     He hangs up, then removes the business card he found in his
     wallet.  He is about to dial but decides otherwise.  He steps
     into the street.

     A HIGH ANGLE

     White walks between tall buildings, towards a narrow street
     that branches off into two separate routes.  He stops.  He
     canít decide which branch to take  -  he steps to the left,
     then steps back, takes a few steps to the right, reconsiders
     again...


     INT.  POLICE STATION/BUMSTEADíS OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     TRACK ALONG  -  piles of towering files bursting at the seams
     with paperwork  -  TO FIND Bumstead hunched over notes,
     photographs and files.  His eyes are rimmed with red.  He
     doesnít seem to be getting anywhere.

                         CRENSHAW O.S.
               Coffee?

     He looks up.  The secretary stands in the doorway with another
     big pile of paperwork.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?  I donít drink coffee.  A cup
               of tea would be good.  Milk and no
               sugar.

     Crenshaw puts the paperwork down on Bumsteadís already
     overcrowded desk.

                         CRENSHAW
               Making progress?

     He looks at her like she just slapped him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               These are the investigations of a
               madman.  He has fabricated an entire
               bizarre paranoid delusion with no
               internal logic whatever.
                    (without looking up)
               This is a mess.  A horrible mess.
                    (looks at her now)
               Itís the second time now.

     Miss Crenshaw looks concerned.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Look at this!

     He holds up a sheet of white paper  -  a report.  The woman
     steps over and looks at it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You typed this report?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Wrong?  Look at this!

     The woman bends down, adjusts her glasses, examines it.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               It seems fine.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Fine?  Look here!

     His finger points at the bottom of the page  -  a tiny,
     INSIGNIFICANT ink smudge.

                         BUMSTEAD
               How can I submit this?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iím sorry...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Do you wash your hands before you
               type things?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Why, yes.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Well be more careful, please.

     An embarrassed beat, then:

     RI-I-I-ING!

     Bumstead reaches for the phone but Crenshaw is on it first.

                         CRENSHAW
               Inspector Bumsteadís office...
               Yes...  Yes...

     She cups the receiver with her hand, looks at Bumstead.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  The Chief-Inspector said
               he would see you now.


     INT.  POLICE STATION HALL-WAY

     TRACKING SHOT towards a door:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR on the frosted
     glass.  A hand reaches INTO FRAME, knocks twice.

                         STROMBOLI O.S.
               Enter!

     INSIDE

     Bumstead steps into the office  -  finds STROMBOLI wandering
     about the room, distracted, searching for something...

                         STROMBOLI
               What is it?

     He pulls the waste-basket up and empties the contents onto his
     desk, sorts through it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               A formality.  I need to speak with
               Thompson.  Officially I need your
               written permission.

     Stromboli is looking through his desk drawers now.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why do you want to speak to him?

                         BUMSTEAD
               A hunch.  He might be able to...

                         STROMBOLI (from under desk)
               Bumstead, donít be so paranoid.
               Leave him alone  -  heís a sad case.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Itís extremely important to my
               investigation...

                         STROMBOLI
               Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything
               else?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Actually, I was wondering, sir, if
               you could let me have a few uniforms,
               to follow up for me...

                         STROMBOLI O.S. (pokes head above desk)
               Absolutely not.  Up to my ears in
               cases right now  -  canít spare
               anyone.

     Stromboli becomes distracted again  -  stands up, looks behind
     pictures hanging off the walls.  A big sign suspended above his
     desk says, SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LITTLE TIME  -  his motto.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Lost something?

                         STROMBOLI
               What makes you think that!  If you
               would learn to concentrate on facts,
               not get so side-tracked  -  you might
               get things done faster, Bumstead...

     The door clicks shut.  Stromboli looks up  -  the inspector has
     gone.


     EXT.  PLAZA  -  NIGHT

     White walks under stone archways.

     Across an empty plaza is a sign above a door:   DRUGS OPEN 24
     HOURS and in smaller print, recently added beneath:   SHAVE &
     HAIRCUT $5.00.


     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     White walks between bare, dusty shelves.  Only one shelf
     carries products  -  BOX AFTER BOX OF "LUMP-O".  He moves up to
     a small counter.  A man with thick glasses, dressed like a
     BARBER, is seated there.

                         WHITE
               I need something to keep me awake.

                         BARBER
               Looks like you need a haircut to me.

                         WHITE
               Thanks.  Just some pills.

                         BARBER
               Only two bucks.  Shave as well...

                         WHITE (annoyed now)
               Your sign says you sell drugs  -
               well, Iím here to buy some.  Okay?

                         BARBER
               Relax.  Sure!

     He waves dramatically to a shelf above his head, with several
     bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules.

                         BARBER
               Tell you what  -  let me cut yer
               hair, give ya watcha need half price.
               Canít argue at that!

                         WHITE (evenly)
               I donít want a haircut.

     LATER

     CAMERA TRACKS OFF a clock on a wall  -  REVEALS WHITE in a
     barber chair.  The BARBER gleefully works on WHITEís hair.  A
     thin OLD GUY in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain,
     smiles, playing a violin.  Heís passionate but bad.

                         BARBER (talks fast)
               Cut hair when I was in the navy,
               yíknow  -  havenít lost the touch.
               Bet youíre happy ëbout that.  Huh!

                         WHITE
               Sell maps?

                         BARBER
               What of?

                         WHITE
               The city.  I need to get to the
               ocean.

                         BARBER
               Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On
               vacation?

     White doesnít answer.  The old guy with the violin moves back
     and forth behind White, smiling as he plays.

                         BARBER
               Grandpa thought customers might like
               some mood music.

                         WHITE (unconvinced)
               Nice...

                         BARBER
               You still look familiar.  Itís
               driving me nuts!  Sure I donít know
               ya from somewhere?

                         WHITE (nervous now)
               Not me.

     Barber looks out the front window as his hands busily trim
     hair.

                         BARBER
               Mnunn.  Cold lately.
                    (lathers up Whiteís
                    face)
               That night, couple weeks ago.  That
               was real cold.  Remember that?

                         WHITE
               Not really...

                         BARBER
               Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says
               the wife.  But she sure canít
               complain.  Heh.  The erector set still
               works good.
                    (points to head)
               And this ainít no fucking rug!
               Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!

     Grandpa laughs and plays louder.

                         GRANDPA
               Yes! Feeeeel it!

     PUSH IN ON WHITE  -  he smiles weakly.


     INT.  DETAIL  -  NIGHT

     A HAND scrawls cryptic diagrams into a notebook.

     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     DOCTOR SCHREBER at his desk.  Heís bearded, with thick lensed
     glasses.  He puts the phone down, sits quietly at his desk,
     staring into space, lost in thought.

     A LOUD RATTLING NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  Schreber looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A rusted pipe runs across the ceiling and down one wall.  He
     steps across to the pipe on the wall, leans down, looks into an
     open hatch at its base.

     Without warning, out of the hatch pops the metal cylinder FROM
     SEVERAL SCENES PREVIOUS and bounces off the doctor's head.

     He curses, picks it up, opens it.  He plucks out the note and
     reads FREDRICKís SCRAWLED MESSAGE:

               DOCTOR, I DID AS YOU ASKED.  BUT
               THINK I MADE STUPID MISTAKE.  HOPE
               THINGS DONíT GET BACK TO YOU.  SORRY.
               -  FREDRICK.

     Schreber looks up  -  then PUNCHES HIS FIST into the desk
     angrily.


     INT.  EMPTY BUILDING

     A P.O.V. MOVES DOWN halls made of wood slatting  -  the floors,
     walls and ceilings are bare boards.  FOOTSTEPS O.S.

     TIGHT ON  -  a manís shadow as it descends a wooden staircase.

     REVEAL WHITE  -  He rummages in a paper bag as he walks.  Pulls
     out two capsules, swallows them.  Now he pulls out a pack of
     "LUMP-O", rips it open, eats ravenously.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps out into a street, turns a corner, drops the empty
     packet of cereal.  Now he sees TWO FIGURES APPROACH.  He hides
     behind a wall before he is seen.  Suddenly a deafening RINGING
     startles him.  He looks across a plaza.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A CHURCH.  A bell-tower, black against the sky.

     White stares up into the night.


     INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     White walks in, sits on A PEW, towards the back of the room,
     glances over his shoulder.  He tries to blend in with the SMALL
     GATHERING OF PEOPLE sitting silently around him.

     A PRIEST  -  appears at the altar, cloaked in a blood-red robe,
     followed by two altar boys also in red.  They move past a
     statue of an insect-like creature, walk in circles chanting
     softly, stop and stare at the congregation through eye-slits in
     their hoods.  The priest begins his sermon.

                         PRIEST
               Beware!  The night is deadly.  There
               is a criminal among us.

     White looks forward.

     TIGHT ON the priestís hand  -  It rises, points, moves over the
     heads of the congregation, accusingly.  Suddenly the red finger
     jabs towards an OLD WOMAN in the front row.

                         PRIEST
               It could be she!  The innocent across
               the street!

     All the congregation turn and stare at the woman.  Sheís
     terrified.

     The hand moves slowly now, across to a BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN
     several rows back.

                         PRIEST
               Or the temptress next door!

     The priest pauses dramatically then:

                         PRIEST
               Or mister nervy stranger at the back!

     Suddenly the finger is pointing at White. All the faces turn,
     stare suspiciously at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  frozen with fright.  Fortunately his face is
     obscured by shadow and the priest lowers his hand, continues
     the sermon.  The people look away.

                         PRIEST
               You are thinking it could be anyone?
               And youíre right!  Why, it could even
               be Mother!

     White goes to leave.  As he stands he notices the DOORS of the
     church open  -  two figures step in and move into the candle-
     light.

     MYSTERY MEN  -  Whiteís bizarre pursuers.  They look around.

     White ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the
     congregation.  He motions to them to keep quiet.  He runs into
     the legs of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN the priest pointed out.  She is
     startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles.

                         PRIEST (continues sermon)
               Evil stalks our streets.  It seeks to
               hide in our hearts.  Have you not
               evil within you now?

     White sees a nearby CONFESSION BOX.  Staying low, he runs,
     almost knocks over a large illuminated candle-holder, darts
     inside.  The girl watches him.

     A GAUNT-FACED WOMAN stands.  Hysterical.  She looks at the
     priest.

                         GAUNT WOMAN
               He took my little boy!  Iíll rip out
               his eyes!

     INSIDE  -  White breaths relief.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  carved on the dark stained wood in front of him
     is a crucified insect.  A voice surprises him.  Another PRIEST,
     OLDER.

                         OLDER PRIEST
               You have sinned?

                         WHITE
               NO.  Ah...

     White watches the two Mystery Men walk past, through the ornate
     wooden grill in front of his face.

                         PRIEST
               I am listening.

                         WHITE (lying)
               Thereís a...  woman.  I don't know
               but I think I, ahh...

                         PRIEST
               You fornicated?

     The Mystery Men look towards the box for a moment, towards
     White, but keep walking.

                         WHITE
               No.  I, ah...

                         PRIEST
               You seem restless.

     The Mystery Men seem to have gone.  White takes out the gun,
     keeping it hidden from the priest.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Only ONE BULLET left.

                         WHITE
               Someoneís after me.

                         PRIEST
               Then we must call the police.

                         WHITE
               No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.

     The silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward.

                         PRIEST
               I see.  Then who is after you?  What
               sins have you committed?

                         WHITE
               Just let me sit here for a moment?
               Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.

     The priest suddenly stares incredulously at White.  His eyes
     widen in horror.

                         PRIEST
               Youíre the murderer?
                    (starts to yell)
               Yes!  That must be it!  Donít kill
               me!

     White lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other
     over his mouth.  The old man stares at him, trembling
     uncontrollably.

                         WHITE
               Shut up!  Listen.  Walk out quietly.
                    (holds up gun)
               Understand?

     The priest nods stupidly.  White pushes him out of the
     confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his
     back.  Together they head for the doors.  Still no sign of the
     Mystery Men.

                         PRIEST
               Donít kill me!

                         WHITE
               Shut up!

                         PRIEST
               Please...

     White loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently.

                         WHITE (not so quietly)
               Iím not going to kill you, okay!

     Faces turn.

     The priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand.  While White
     is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away.

                         PRIEST (shouting/pointing)
               CRIMINAL!

     People start to scream and run.  The GAUNT WOMAN points at
     White.

                         GAUNT WOMAN (screams insanely)
               Itís him!  Rip out his eyes!

     Frightened, White holds the gun out.  Everyone panics,
     scatters.  People run for the exit.  Religious statues topple
     and smash.  The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor,
     trampled by the crowd.

     Amidst the chaos, the two MYSTERY MEN appear across the room,
     see White, head towards him.  He turns and runs.

     A STAIRCASE

     White climbs narrow stairs rapidly.


     INT.  BELL TOWER

     White stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street
     through a series of arched windows.  A low, raftered room,
     three huge black BELLS.

     Suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to
     swing, build momentum.

     CLANG!  CLA-A-A-ANG!  A cacophony of noise.

     White puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the
     stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Through the swinging bells  -  the MYSTERY MEN climb the last
     few steps on the other end of the dark room.  They advance
     slowly, clutching daggers.

     White raises his gun.  Aims.  Difficult to find his target  -
     the approaching MEN are obscured by the bells.

     White steps sideways, never taking his eyes off the Men.  They
     follow him slowly, pivoting about the bells in the centre of
     the tower, pursuers and pursued remaining a semi-circle apart.

                         WHITE (shouts)
               What do you want?  Tell me!

     The Men stop.  So does White.  They separate, now approaching
     him from OPPOSITE sides, moving around the bells.

     White doesnít know who to point the gun at  -  he swings back
     and forth, one to the other, faster and faster, as the Men
     approach.

     He lets them get uncomfortably close, then swings to his right,
     thrusts the gun to one Manís forehead.  FIRES.  The Man steps
     back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing,
     FALLS into the shaft at the centre of the tower.

     The second Man SWINGS his dagger at White.

     White falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily.  The Man
     advances, smiling  -  kicks the gun across the wooden floor.

     White, clutching at straws, lifts his foot, kicks down hard on
     a loose floorboard.  The board flies up, pivoting against
     Whiteís heel, catches the Mystery Man with a CRACK under the
     chin.

     White runs at the off-balance Man, head-butts him in the
     stomach.  The Man recoils, canít stop, steps off backwards into
     space, PLUMMETS INTO DARKNESS towards the street below.

     White relieved, turns, dusts himself, picks up his gun.  Looks
     down at the floor.  Broken glass and capsules everywhere  -  he
     dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle.  Starts to pick
     them up.

     Behind him SOMETHING is rising.

     The shadowy Mystery Man is LEVITATING HIMSELF back up to the
     bell-tower.  He lands behind White, approaches, lifting his
     dagger, closer and closer.

     White glances around.

     The Man lunges, pushing White towards the shaft beneath the
     swinging bells.  White FALLS, dangles over dark space, the Man
     stands above him.

                         MYSTERY MAN (shouts)
               Do not make us hurt you...

     The bells are swinging very close to the Man.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               It will be inconvenient, yes...

     Suddenly, to Whiteís amazement, the shiny black rim of a bell
     clips the Manís head.  SLAMS it against a low wooden beam in
     the ceiling.  A splash of black liquid.  The Man slumps to the
     ground, his head crushed beyond recognition.

     White pulls himself up  -  stands over the Manís body, trying
     to decide what to do.  A MOVEMENT catches his eye.

     TIGHT ON the collapsed Manís ear  -  something moves inside.  A
     BLACK INSECT, half-dead, crawls out of his crushed head.

     White revolted, SQUASHES the insect under his shoe.


     EXT./INT.  VARIOUS  -  MONTAGE

     RAPID MOVE ACROSS MYSTERY MEN screaming.  Faces contort with
     pain.  INTERCUT WITH:

     Electricity ARCING between electrodes.

     A building against the sky.  The windows EXPLODE.  Glass blows
     out, raining down on the street.

     A concrete wall SPLITS OPEN.  Slime oozes through the crack.

     An old man, walks on a deserted street, looks up at the sky.
     One of the lenses of his spectacles CRACKS without warning.
     A chair falls over in a dark room.

     A woman under a hair-dryer gossips on a phone.  Suddenly the
     phone emits a high-pitched shriek.  Her ear spouts blood and
     she screams.

     A small transistor radio emits a high frequency and short
     circuits with a spark.


     EXT.  BUILDING

     TIGHT ON  -  a wristwatch spinning backwards rapidly  -
     completely haywire.

     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD stands on a street corner staring blankly at
     his watch.  Taps it several times, annoyed, then looks up at a
     THREE STOREY BUILDING.  He holds a piece of paper in his other
     hand  -  on it a number rapidly scrawled:  23.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The dilapidated building  -  arched windows only on the topmost
     floor.  A faded number on the facade  -  also 23.  The windows
     light up continuously with rapid bursts of white light.

     INSIDE

     The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room.

     TWO FIGURES move about.  Bumstead glances at a UNIFORMED MAN,
     standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival.

     To the side, A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER flashes something swinging
     back and forth, hanging from the ceiling.  It looks like...
     Fredrick.  Dead.  His arms and legs missing.  A pool of blood
     beneath the mutilated torso.

     Bumstead looks at the cop.

                         BUMSTEAD
               How long have you been here?

                         COP
               Maybe ten minutes...
                    (looks at his watch)
               Thatís strange.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Spinning backwards?

     The cop is shaking his watch, tapping it with his finger.  He
     looks up.  Bumstead indicates his own watch.

                         COP
               Yours too?

     Bumstead nods.  He removes a notebook from his pocket, walks
     about the room, glances at objects, makes notes.

     Bumstead steps over to a small RECTANGULAR HOLE in the wall.
     He examines it carefully, then bends down and puts his head
     through.  On the other side is a corridor snaking off into
     darkness.  Just beneath the hole, is a broken dish and a
     puddle.  Lying half in the puddle is the business card of
     Doctor D.P. Schreber M.D.

     Without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby
     cop.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I want prints over here...

     Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteadís head in it.  He
     struggles.  The cop and the photographer run over to help.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     MOVE IN ON a doorway.  Above it a small illuminated red sign:

     DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D.

     REVERSE ANGLE ON WHITE

     He stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his
     wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesnít have
     anymore.


     INT.  WAITING ROOM

     A white room, bare.  Dirt stains the walls near the air-vents.
     A NURSE is typing behind her desk.

     A THUMPING fills the room.  The nurse stands, removes her shoe
     and hits a pipe running along the wall several times.  The
     noise stops.

     The front door creaks open and White enters.  She watches him
     step into the room.

                         WHITE
               I want to see the doctor.  It's
               important.

                         NURSE
               What time was your appointment?

                         WHITE (angry)
               Look!  Tell him I'm here.  Now.

     He's leaning across her desk threateningly.

                         NURSE (scared/standing)
               Yes, certainly...  Who should I say?

                         WHITE
               No idea.  Just get him...

     Suddenly a door opens and DOCTOR SCHREBER, clutching a file of
     papers, steps out.  He freezes, stares at White.  The papers
     fall from his hands to the floor.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     A group of DARK SILHOUETTES file into a concrete room.

     The MYSTERY MEN have gathered.  Like the Men who pursue White,
     they wear coats, leather gloves, dark glasses, and have near
     white skin.

     One MAN points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the
     peculiar foreign tongue.

     TIGHT ON THE DIAGRAM  -  a path through the city.  A circle
     marks the point where the red line ends  -  a cathedral.  The
     Man goes into broken English  -  a guttural accent.

                         MAN 1
               It has failed.

     ANOTHER MAN stands at the rear of the room.

                         MAN 2
               This is becoming dangerous, yes!

     YET ANOTHER MAN starts to tremble violently, seized with some
     kind of convulsion.  He froths at the mouth and throws his head
     about.  A TALLER MAN standing beside him opens a silver box,
     removes a small WRITHING WORM.  He places this on the tip of
     the trembling Man's tongue, who swallows it and calms down.

                         MAN 3
               Let's get this over with.

     ANOTHER MAN rises suddenly, pushes forcefully to the front of
     the group.

                         MAN 5
               What about the dance-steps!  This is
               my responsibility, we must resolve
               this issue, yes?

     THE MEN turn to face him.  He is out of line.  He becomes
     irritated, as if to say something further, then pulls himself
     short, sits down.

                         MAN 5
               Sorry.

                         MAN 3
               The situation has changed.
                    (pacing the room)
               This one is in possession of
               knowledge...

                         MAN 1 (cuts in)
               ...to avoid influence, yes.

                         MAN 4
               A freak!

                         MAN 1
               Impossible!

     RUMBLING NOISE O.S. attracts everyone's attention.  They all
     look to a round portal high on a wall.  The noise is louder.
     several figures on stilts run past outside the opening  -  then
     the noise subsides.  The MYSTERY MEN go back to more important
     things.

                         MAN 3
               It gets interesting, yes.

                         MAN 2
               Stop this!  It has gone too far!
               Tell Mister Black!

     Man 2 stares blankly into space, he makes a peculiar clicking
     noise with his mouth, his eyes roll upwards.


     INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE

     THE CAMERA GLIDES down a corridor, towards a door  -  a sign
     says, DOCTOR IS:  IN.

     INSIDE

     White sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden
     desk.  THE DOCTOR paces up and down in front of glass jars
     containing preserved specimens.  He stops, looks at White.

                         SCHREBER
               You remember nothing?  Who you are?
               What you've done?

                         WHITE
               You know something about me?

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't
               it?
                    (smiles)
               Is there nothing you remember?  Not
               even a detail?   You must try.

                         WHITE
               You think I haven't been trying!
                    (calms himself)
               It's like there was never anything
               there.
                    (pauses)
               Just water.

                         SCHREBER
               Water?

                         WHITE
               Waves...  A beach.  A woman
               whispering.  That's all.
                    (looks up, yawns)
               I need to stay awake.  Do you have
               any pills?

     The doctor walks to a glass cabinet and removes a bottle, takes
     out two green capsules.  Hands them to White.  Sits behind the
     desk again.

                         SCHREBER
               What does she say?  The woman.

                         WHITE
               Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just
               like a broken record.  Only thing is,
               I can't answer.  I've no idea what my
               name is.

                         SCHREBER
               Your name is John White.

                         WHITE
               That's what people keep telling me.

     Te doctor walks to a small sink in the corner, returns, hands
     White a glass of water.  White swallows the pills.

                         SCHREBER  (indicates pills)
               And what's this about?  Why?

     White stands up, starts to pace nervously.

                         SCHREBER
               Bad dreams?

                         WHITE
               Yes.

                         SCHREBER
               Tell me about them...

                         WHITE (interrupts)
               Yeah well, why don't I ask some
               questions for a change.

                         SCHREBER
               If you like.

                         WHITE
               You're supposed to be my doctor,
               right?

                         SCHREBER
               That's right.  I am your doctor.

     White is very agitated now, his voice is getting edgy.

                         WHITE
               Known me for long?

                        SCHREBER
               Well...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Am I a killer?

                         SCHREBER
               I cannot say...  You don't know the
               answer to that?

                         WHITE
               I told you, I can't remember a thing!

     White reaches across abruptly, GRABS the doctor.

                         WHITE  (angry now  -  shouting)
               Look, you know something about me,
               out with it!  Let's end this
               bullshit!  I want answers!

     The doctor is obviously scared.

                         SCHREBER
               We won't get anywhere like this.
               Please.  Let's take things in easy
               steps...


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON DRAWING PINS  -  Being pushed into a map.  A seeming
     random pattern across the terrain of the city.  Each pin is
     labelled:  VICTIM 1, VICTIM 2,...  etc.

     WIDER ON BUMSTEAD

     He's tired, like he hasn't slept.  He's looking at the map
     stuck to a wall.  There's several neat piles of folders on the
     kitchen table in front of him.  The kitchen itself is
     incredibly neat  -  everything completely organized.

     Bumstead shakes his head slowly, turns away from the board.
     Picks up a cup of hot tea, pours milk into it from a small jar.

     TIGHT ON THE TEA CUP  -  Cream SWIRLS into a rapidly dissolving
     spiral.  Bumstead looks up.  Puts down the cup hurriedly, turns
     back to the map.

     With a thick pen he traces a line between each point marking
     the location of the victims.  He steps back to examine his
     handiwork.

     A SPIRAL  -  moving outwards.  Beyond the last victim it
     becomes a dotted line, following the same trajectory but with a
     big question mark beside it.

     Bumstead glances over to a blackboard with a list of names and
     addresses on it.  He holds up the doctor's card and stares at
     it.  He turns it over, notices an address on the back.


     INT.  DOCTOR SCHREBER'S OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER is showing WHITE a series of CHARTS.  The doctor seems
     nervous about White's potential for further violence.

                         SCHREBER
               Put simply...  a penetration of the
               left parieto-occipital area of the
               cranium...  complicated by
               inflammation that resulted in
               adhesions of the brain to the
               meninges.  Without going into
               detail...  the formation of scar
               tissue altered the configuration of
               the lateral ventricles, producing
               incipient atrophy of the medulla...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Look.  It was a simple question.  Can
               someone kill and not remember it?

                         SCHREBER (smiles)
               I'm sorry.  I get carried away
               sometimes.  Possible?  I'm...  ah,
               afraid so.

                         WHITE
               Did she drown?  The woman you told me
               about?

                         SCHREBER
               Not exactly.  She was found in a
               canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut.
               Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a
               bed-sheet.

     White shakes his head, looking blankly at the doctor.

                         WHITE
               Horrible...

                         SCHREBER
               You remember nothing, eh?
                    (shakes his head)
               Let me show you something.

     Schreber turns, points to DOUBLE-DOORS.  He walks towards
     these.  White follows.

                         SCHREBER
               Formation of memories is the most
               important of brain functions.

     THE DOORS ARE OPENED

     They step into a room of living animal experiments.

                         SCHREBER
               We are little more than a sum of
               memories.  From them we reference who
               we are, where we're going.  Without a
               past we are nothing.  This is why you
               are so interesting.

                         WHITE
               I'm nothing then.

                         SCHREBER
               Anything but, my friend.

     The two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head
     missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its
     movements.

                         SCHREBER
               It feels no pain.

     White turns and starts to pace away.  Schreber reluctantly
     follows.

                         WHITE
               Can I get my life back?

                         SCHREBER
               Maybe.

     Schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing
     two rats.

                         SCHREBER
               We know of two kinds of memory.
               Firstly, declarative memory.

     The rats perform various activities involving mazes and
     geometric symbols.  Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow
     raised.

                         SCHREBER
               And then there is procedural memory.

     TIGHT ON HIS SLENDER FINGER  -  pointing to a machine also run
     by rats.  The object is to make it through a guillotine device.
     One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two.

                         SCHREBER
               Follow?

     White nods.

                         SCHREBER
               Research on simple animals can be...
               useful.  To show us where memory
               storing systems are located, for
               example.  I am building an experiment
               with hamsters next.
                    (looks at nearby cage
                    of hamsters)
               Cute little things.

     Schreber puts a hand on White's shoulder.

                         SCHREBER
               Listen to me talk!  You must be
               hungry.

     White nods again, extremely troubled.


     INT.  HALL-WAY (DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE)

     Schreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a
     maze-like series of rooms and halls.  White is led down a dark
     hall by Schreber, clutching a candle.

                         SCHREBER
               Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's
               old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed.
               Here we are.

     They've stopped outside a flaking door.


     INT.  KITCHEN

     A small eat-in kitchen.  Dirty and run-down.  White, sits at a
     bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator.  The
     doctor holds up a large FROZEN fish.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just
               how I like 'em!

     ANGLE ON FRYING PAN ON STOVE  -  The fish lands in it and starts
     to sizzle furiously.

     ANGLE ON WHITE

                         WHITE
               I'm sorry.  About before.

                         SCHREBER
               I don't blame you for getting angry.
               You are in a frustrating situation.
               You must be patient though.  Trust me
               completely.  I'm here to help.

     A set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open
     slightly and THE NURSE looks in.

                         NURSE (to Schreber)
               I have to talk to you.

                         SCHREBER
               It can't wait?

     She shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out
     again.

                         SCHREBER  (to White)
               Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at
               home.

     He leaves.

     Alone, White looks around the bleak room.  He takes off his
     coat and sits down again.  He removes the FISH.  The eye opens.
     The creature looks up at him.  It breaths painfully.

                         WHITE
               Still kicking, huh?

     He puts it back in his pocket.

     The OTHER fish is spattering oil everywhere.  Smoke starts to
     fill the room.  White, steps over and looks at the frying pan.
     The fish is turning black.  He turns the heat down.

     He notices a SMALL HOLE in the wall.  At eye height.  He steps
     across, looks through.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S eye through the hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A dark room.  Shadows on the wall.  Something wet, some kind of
     ANIMAL, moving in the darkness.  He can hear breathing and
     whispering voices.

     White's eyes start to blur, he rubs them.

                         SCHREBER O.S.
               How are things in here?

     White spins, like he's caught doing something wrong.  The
     Doctor walks across to the stove, prods the frying fish with a
     fork.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, nearly done.  So tell me about
               your dreams.  I'm very interested.

     White is having a hard time focusing.

                         WHITE
               Just the typical fabrications of a
               distorted mind.  You know, chased by
               mysterious men in black, that kind of
               thing...

     WHITE'S P.O.V.  -  ANGLE ON Schreber with his back turned, at
     the stove.  THE IMAGE is blurring.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, our friends in black...  they are
               not just a figment of your
               imagination you know, in fact none of
               what you are experiencing is anything
               but real.

     Smoke rises thickly around the doctor.

                         SCHREBER
               I know everything about you.  You
               have no choice but to trust me.

     Flames are shooting up around Schreber from the frying pan.
     His arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching
     flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire,
     his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull.

                         SCHREBER
               Scarey, isn't it?

     White startles awake.

     Schreber stands at the stove looking at White.  Everything is
     normal.

                         SCHREBER
               Are you feeling alright?

     White stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on.

                         SCHREBER
               What are you doing?

                         WHITE
               I have to go...

                         SCHREBER
               You can't go yet.  We've got so much
               to talk about...

     Suddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady
     himself.

                         SCHREBER
               You're tired.  You need to lie down.

     ON WHITE  -  swaying.

                         WHITE
               Those pills...

     HIS P.O.V.

     The scene is distorted  -  like looking through water.  Things
     start SPINNING.

                         SCHREBER (echoic)
               Yes.  A little something to help you
               relax.  Harmless...

     A tile floor RISES rapidly TOWARDS CAMERA.

                                              CUT TO:

     GREY LIMBO

     Objects float underwater.  They rise upwards amidst bubbles,
     break the surface.  A storm at sea  -  dismembered BODY PARTS
     float all the way to the horizon.

     TWO FOETUSES in separate jars are talking to each other through
     the glass.

                         FOETUS 1
               This is madness.  If we're caught...

                         FOETUS 2
               Shut-up.  Help me with these
               straps...


     INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

     WHITE wakes strapped to an exantination table.  SCHREBER and the
     NURSE loom above him.  The nurse hands Schreber a long, chrome
     SYRINGE.  The doctor moves towards White.

                         SCHREBER (holds syringe up)
               Now you must relax, Anton.

     A DOOR-BELL RINGS O.S. The nurse makes for the door.

                         SCHREBER
               Leave it!

     He's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air
     bubbles.  THE DOOR-BELL RINGS again  -  very insistent.
     Schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed.

                         SCHREBER
               Damn!  Whoever it is  -  get rid of
               them!

     She heads to the door  -  turns back.

                         NURSE
               Keys.

     Schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls
     out a huge collection of KEYS on a ring, walks to the nurse,
     hands them to her.

     White manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap
     holding him.  The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door,
     locks it.  He steps over to White.

                         SCHREBER
               I'm sorry I had to put you through
               this, Anton.
                    (lowers syringe to
                    White's forehead)
               There will be some pain, but things
               will be easier this way.

     White lashes out, PUNCHES the doctor in the face.  His glasses
     go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for
     the spectacles.

     A convenient scalpel cuts White from his remaining bonds.  He
     undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces
     his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe INTO
     WHITE'S FOREHEAD.

     The struggle continues  -  each man tries to turn the syringe
     on the other.  White pushes the doctor, who falls backwards.
     Schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical
     instruments.

     A loud THUMPING on the examination room door.  White is grabbed
     from behind, pinned down with the syringe INCHES from his face.

     A CRASH O.S.  Splintering wood.  The door bursts open.

     A ROTUND SILHOUETTE  -  is revealed, clutching a police
     special, flashing a badge.  A squeaky, over-excited, voice:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Hold it!

     Schreber and White FREEZE in mid-struggle, look at the
     inspector.  Behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Police.  Nobody move.

                         SCHREBER
               He tried to kill me!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...

     Bumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in White's face,
     handcuffs him.  Bumstead searches White, finds the revolver,
     takes this.  Also takes his wallet.  He glances at the doctor,
     who hides the syringe behind his back.

                         BUMSTEAD (to Doctor)
               You Schreber?

     Schreber nods blankly.

     Bumstead runs his hand over White's side pocket  -  feels
     something.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What's that?

     White says nothing.  The inspector opens the pocket and looks
     in.

                         BUMSTEAD (disgusted)
               A fish, huh?


     EXT.  CITY STREETS  -  NIGHT

     An old-fashioned BLACK SEDAN drives over a rusty suspension
     bridge.  Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle.  It's
     been raining.  Streets are empty.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     WHITE and the INSPECTOR drive silently.  Bumstead has appointed
     his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home.
     Hot thermos.  Note pad holder, complete with light.  Coat
     hanger.  Gun rack.  A system for everything.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit!
                    (glances at his
                    watch)
               I'm curious?  How many so far?

     He shakes his watch, puts it to his ear.

                         WHITE (confused)
               What?  I...

                         BUMSTEAD (counts on fingers)
               Let's see, there's the little guy
               with no arms or legs.  And the young
               boy?

                         WHITE (disturbed)
               Young boy?

     CLOSE ON WHITE  -  frightened now.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The six year old.  Sure, you
               remember.

     Bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard.  A SANDWICH,
     carefully wrapped and prepared.  After glancing at his watch
     again, he bites into it.

                         BUMSTEAD (chewing)
               Y'know, the kid you left in the meat
               packing plant, cut into pieces.
               Packed into brown paper parcels,
               wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.

     No answer.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You sure have demonstrated a great
               deal of...  imagination.  The baby
               was the best though.  Several cops
               lost their lunch over that one.  Head
               twisted off, spine pulled out,
               yeech...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Stop it.  You're making me sick...

                         BUMSTEAD
               We count seven so far.  Anyone we
               missed?

     RADIO CRACKLE O.S.  -  A tinny voice cuts in.

                         VOICE
               Inspector Bumstead...  Inspector...

     Bumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is it, Crenshaw?

                         CRENSHAW
               Just reminding you...  your eight pee
               em...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit.
                    (looks at watch)
               Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw.
               Remind me to give you my watch.  It
               needs fixing.

                         CRENSHAW
               Yes sir.

     Bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a
     SHARP CORNER as he finishes off the sandwich.

                         WHITE
               Where are we going?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Shut-up.

     Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from
     his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel.

     White is silent  -  his wounds continue to bother him.  He
     leans down to scratch through his trousers.

                         WHITE (quietly)
               Shit!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Gesundheit!

                         WHITE (looks up)
               I didn't sneeze.


     EXT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE  -  NIGHT

     The INSPECTOR's car pulls up and stops.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE
               What are we doing here?

     Bumstead grabs a bunch of flowers off the back seat.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Get out.


     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pushes the handcuffed WHITE through a swinging metal
     door.  They enter a sterile air-conditioned room.  An
     effeminate MALE NURSE sits behind a glassed-in counter.
     Directly opposite is a small WAITING ROOM through a glass
     panelled door.  Bumstead pushes White into this room.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Wait here.

     The inspector shuts the door behind him.  White looks about the
     blank room, takes a seat.  He can see Bumstead, through the
     glass panel in the door, walk up to the male nurse opposite.

     OUT IN THE CORRIDOR

     The inspector talks to the male nurse through a tiny opening in
     the window.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Bumstead.  I'm here to see my mother.

     BACK TO WHITE

     He cannot hear anything of what Bumstead is saying.  He sees
     him take out his wallet and show his badge.  The male nurse is
     concerned, looks over towards White, then opens a drawer, hands
     Bumstead a KEY.  The inspector steps back to the waiting room
     door and LOCKS IT from the outside.  He looks at White for a
     moment, then walks away, along the corridor.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM

     Bumstead enters darkness  -  pneumatic MACHINE NOISE fills the
     gloom.  He walks quietly to his mother, encased in a metallic
     contraption, something like an iron lung.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)
               Brought you these.

     He places flowers on the bedside table.  His mother just stares
     expressionless into space, in a coma.  He sits on a metal
     chair, looks at the woman.  Her life-sustaining machines hiss
     and breathe.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A FINGER presses down on the sticky surface of a page.  It
     pulls away revealing an inky finger-print.

     WIDER

     White is standing in a bare room, in front of a finger-printing
     machine.  He's alone.  A blast of electrical FEED-BACK.  White
     looks up at a speaker mounted to the wall.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE  (through speaker)
               Move  -  forward.

     White follows a painted line on the floor, stands against a
     wall, in front of an old-fashioned camera.  A slot opens in the
     wall behind him, mechanical arms spring forward, restrain him,
     one arm holds a sign with a number in front of him.  A flash
     goes off, the click of a shutter.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Left  -  profile.

     A claw lowers from the ceiling, grips White's head, turns it
     abruptly  -  the camera fires.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Right  -  profile.

     The claw turns his head the other way.  The camera fires again.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     Across the room A BUZZER SOUNDS, a red light flashes above a
     door.  White is released by the mechanical hands, walks over,
     opens the door and steps into darkness.

     LIGHTS COME ON  -  extremely bright.  A room for line-ups  -
     markings on the white wall behind White indicate varying
     heights, a darkened window faces him.  He is obviously to be
     identified by an unseen person.

     A buzzer sounds again, a light indicates another door.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     White moves into another room.  A chair faces a large wheel
     painted in a black and white spiral.  He sits down  -  the
     wheel turns, faster and faster.

                         VOICE
               Watch  -  the  - wheel.

     The wheel stops after several seconds.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is full of scientific equipment.

                         VOICE
               Stand  -  behind  -  the  -  screen.

     White sees a metal-frame X-ray machine  -  he steps across to
     it.  The screen lights up, filling the room with a green glow.
     We can see the shape of his skeleton.  Where his pocket would
     be, is the tiny skeleton of the fish.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is empty.

                         VOICE
               Face  -  the  - wall.

     White turns.  As soon as he has done this hears a door open
     behind him.  FOOTSTEPS approach.  Blows rain down on him, fists,
     boots, clubs.  He slides to the floor.  The lights go out.


     INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

     LIGHTS come on again.  White is dazed  -  in a chair, a bright
     light in his face blinds him.

                         VOICE
               What's your name?

                         WHITE  (squints into light)
               I don't remember.

                         VOICE
               Oh, no?

     White shakes his head slowly and looks at the floor.  The light
     is angled away, pointed down towards A TABLE.  White can see
     now.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A featureless room.  STROMBOLI stands over him, behind him is
     BUMSTEAD and two shadowy guards.  Bumstead picks up an
     envelope, removes a SERIES OF PHOTOS, hands these to Stromboli.

                         STROMBOLI
               John...

     He throws the first shot down on the table in front of White.
     A black and white police photo of a murder victim.

                         STROMBOLI
               ...Murderer.

     Another photo goes down.  Another victim.  Another and another.
     Each more grisly than the last.

                         STROMBOLI
               You'll sign a confession?

     White nods.  He's looks utterly lost.

     Bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near
     the only door, presses a button.

                         BUMSTEAD (into speaker)
               Okay.

     TWO GUARDS immediately step through the door, GRAB White by his
     arms.  They carry him off.


     INT.  PRISON CELL

     White is woken by a UNIFORMED GUARD shining a light in his
     eyes.

                         GUARD
               Visitor.


     INT.  VISITING ROOM

     White is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier
     down the middle.  The guard tells him to sit and wait.

     The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  -
     DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened.

                         WHITE  (to guard)
               Keep him away:  He's insane.

     The guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly.

                         SCHREBER
               Please, stay calm.

                         WHITE  (to guard)
               This man wants to kill me.

     The guard remains indifferent.

                         SCHREBER  (to guard)
               Just one of his many delusions  -
               it's nothing.
                    (a whisper to White)
               Shut up!  Listen, damn you!  This is
               a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't
               get another chance like this.  Listen
               to me.

                         WHITE  (turns to Doctor)
               What do you want?

                         SCHREBER
               You're innocent...
                    (still a whisper)
               You didn't kill anyone.

                         WHITE  (sarcastic)
               What am I doing in here then?

                         SCHREBER
               Listen to what I have to say.  Decide
               for yourself.

     AN ADJOINING ROOM

     The dark silhouettes of BUMSTEAD and ANOTHER COP watch from
     behind a two-way mirror.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What's he doing here?

                         COP
               Says he is the man's doctor...
                    (taps side of his
                    head)
               You know...

                         BUMSTEAD
               I know it's his doctor...
                    (into intercom)
               I need the file on..
                    (reads clip-board)
               Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.

                         MISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S.
               Schreber.  Yes.  Isn't that his
               doctor?

                         BUMSTEAD (evenly)
               Yes.
                    (beat)
               And it's SCHREBER  -  with an 'h'.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes.  An "h".

     The inspector looks up from the speaker.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  THROUGH THE MIRROR, White seems to have calmed
     down.

     BACK IN THE VISITING ROOM

                         SCHREBER
               The men in black  -  they're the
               killers.

     White stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass.

                         WHITE
               You're a liar!

                         SCHREBER
               No, it's the truth.

                         WHITE
               So you're telling me the truth this
               time?  Is that it!

     The doctor removes a SMALL SYRINGE from his black bag, places
     it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the
     guard's view.

                         SCHREBER
               If you would only take this, inject
               it in your brain, everything would be
               much clearer.

                         WHITE
               Not that again...

                         SCHREBER
               Everyone get's one  -  very much like
               this...
                    (points to syringe)
               But this one's special.  It will help
               you understand, everything...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               I'm not injecting anything into my
               brain.

                         SCHREBER
               Anton  -  I mean, John, there
               has been an experiment, a dangerous
               experiment.  I arranged it.  It was a
               lie from the beginning.  It almost
               worked, but things did not go as they
               should have.  You have been left  -
               blank.

     Schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him.

                         SCHREBER
               You can change this, all this.
                    (points at syringe
                    again)
               But you must take it.

     White stares blankly at him for a moment, then:

                         WHITE
               You've been working too hard.

                         SCHREBER
               Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is
               short.  Let me show you something.
               Look at this syringe.

                         WHITE
               Why?

                         SCHREBER
               Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at
               it.

     White reluctantly does this.

                         SCHREBER
               Concentrate.  Imagine the syringe
               rising.  Picture it floating above the
               table.

     TIGHT ON WHITE

                         SCHREBER
               Do it!

     WHITE'S P.O.V.

     The syringe starts to vibrate, actually RISES INTO THE AIR  -
     floats stationary between White and Schreber.

                         WHITE
               It's a trick.

                         SCHREBER
               No it isn't.  You are doing it!  Now
               raise it over the glass and...

     Suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor, IMPALES itself
     in his shoulder.  He yelps, grabs it.

                         WHITE
               Oh, sorry...

     The doctor pulls out the syringe, is about to say more when a
     BUZZER SOUNDS.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Your  -  time  -  is  -  up.

     Schreber looks to where the voice came from  -  a speaker above
     their heads.

                         SCHREBER (looks at White)
               I gave you your chance, now it's too
               late.  They'll learn you are here
               soon.  It's all over.


     INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR

     DOCTOR SCHREBER paces towards the exit.  BUMSTEAD steps in
     front of him.  The doctor is startled.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Doctor!  What brings you here?

                         SCHREBER
               Just visiting my patient.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Really?  And how is his state of
               mind?

                         SCHREBER
               He's seriously disturbed...

     The doctor is nervous, glancing about.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You seem a little edgy.  Everything
               okay?

                         SCHREBER
               Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...

     He tries to push past.  Bumstead grabs his arm.

                         BUMSTEAD
               To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've
               run into each other like this.  Maybe
               you can help me tidy some loose ends.

                         SCHREBER
               Loose ends?

     SCHREBER looks like a trapped animal, when:

                         VOICE O.S.
               Bumstead!

     Bumasead turns to look down the corridor.  He sees STROMBOLI
     peaking out of his office door.

                         STROMBOLI
               I need to speak to you.  Immediately.

     The door shuts again.  Bumstead turns back.  The doctor is GONE
     -  the corridor empty.


     INT.  HOLDING CELL

     White is staring through a glass door at A COP.  A KETTLE
     WHISTLES O.S.  The cop gets up and moves off.

     White looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small WINDOW, high up on the wall.  Impossible to get to,
     even if his hands weren't cuffed.  Nothing he can do  -  he
     looks at a clock on a wall.

     PUSH IN on the clock  -  TICKING GETS LOUDER.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD enters STROMBOLI'S office.  A nervous CHIEF-INSPECTOR
     is flanked by TWO STRANGE-LOOKING MEN in ill-fitting brown
     suits.

                         STROMBOLI
               Bumstead, these...  er, gentlemen are
               here to collect White.

     Bumstead suspiciously eyes the two men, beside STROMBOLI'S
     desk.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to men)
               Who are you?

                         STROMBOLI (even more nervous)
               Please, Bumstead.  Co-operate  -
               it's easier.

                         BUMSTEAD
               This is highly irregular.  I have a
               right to know.

                         MAN 1
               We are from a mental asylum.

     He notices that this man's moustache is LOP-SIDED.  The other
     man wears spectacles WITH NO LENSES in the frames, clutches an
     un-lit pipe in his teeth.

                         STROMBOLI
               Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he
               needs expert help.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I see...

                         MAN 1
               Yes, Inspector.  Has he been
               displaying any strange...  behaviour?

                         BUMSTEAD
               He's been a little angel...

                         STROMBOLI
               If you could show them to the holding
               cell now.

     SLOW MOVE IN on Bumstead's face.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     Bumstead and the MYSTERY MEN walk towards the holding cell.
     Bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he
     enters.  IT'S EMPTY.

     He fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket  -  BURSTS into
     the room.  White is gone.  But where?  Bumstead throws a look
     back TO THE FRONT DESK.

                         MAN 1
               Where is he?

     The cop is just returning, holding a cup of coffee.  He looks
     at the inspector, sees the room is empty.  A nervous twitch
     knocks the cup from the cop's hands.

     TIGHT ON THE CUP  -  smashing on the floor.


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION  -  NIGHT

     Underground.  CONSTANT NOISE O.S. of trains arriving and
     departing but none are seen.

     CAMERA MOVES PAST broken tiles on a wall to REVEAL:  WHITE  -
     sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused,
     groggy from sleep.  He looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully
     tries to free them from the cuffs.

     MOVE IN TIGHT ON WHITE

     He starts to cry.  He puts his head in his hands, his body
     spasms with each sob.

     SEVERAL ANGLES of the empty corridors of the subway.  White's
     crying is heard  -  echoic.

     BACK ON WHITE  -  A small feminine HAND touches his head.

     Startled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be
     attacked.

     THE BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN from the church looks down at him.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD and the COP are getting grilled by STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't
               understand how it was possible.  The
               only window was twenty feet up a
               vertical wall, he was cuffed...

                         STROMBOLI
                    (shouts at cringing
                    COP)
               How could you have been so stupid?
 
                         COP
               I'm sorry, sir.

                         STROMBOLI
               Alright, get out.

     Bumstead gets up and leaves.

                         STROMBOLI
               You stay.

     The cop hustles out, shuts the door.

                         STROMBOLI
               Bumstead, you're starting to annoy
               me.  This case is very important to
               me.  Just a little warning:  I've got
               my eye on you inspector, remember
               that.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir.

     He leaves.


     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING

     White, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat,
     follows the JAPANESE WOMAN up a flight of dark stairs.  she
     keeps looking back at him, smiling but SAYS NOTHING.


     INT.  APARTMENT

     White and the woman step into a run-down apartment.  She points
     to a couch.  White looks uncomfortable.  She smiles again, then
     turns on the radio.  MUSIC.

     She steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving White alone.  He
     gets up and starts to tune the radio.  A babble of fragments of
     voices and music, then:  A NEWS REPORT...

                         NEWS READER O.S.
               ...earlier this evening it was
               reported a man fitting his
               description had been apprehended.

     White listens nervously.

                         NEWS READER O.S.
               ...and now for a message from LUMP-O
               food products...

     Across the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar.  He
     crosses to the doorway and looks in.  The woman stands naked
     against a deep red wall, her back turned.  She has an elaborate
     TATTOO on her back  -  looks like an INSECT.  She puts on a
     dressing gown and TURNS SUDDENLY.

     White steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the
     couch.

     She steps from the doorway holding a BAR OF SOAP in her hand.
     She sits down beside White and takes his hands, gently
     lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at
     him.  White looks down.

     His hands seem to have SHRUNK  -  they poke out of his sleeves
     like tiny children's limbs.  The cuffs effortlessly slip off.

     White looks at the woman, then back at his hands  -  NOTHING
     STRANGE, they are normal size, but somehow the cuffs have been
     removed.  He looks at the woman again, grateful.  He can't help
     smiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Her eyes.  Her lips.  Her neck.  She leans forward, goes OUT OF
     FOCUS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     She touches her tongue to his lips.  Kisses his face.  She
     pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open.
     White does not respond  -  seems uncertain.  She sits upright,
     astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses
     his chest.  She stops, her face in shadow.

     Slowly, White lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them.
     She starts to breath deeply.

     OUT OF FOCUS  -  their bodies entangle, begin to move
     rhythmically.  The CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS, REVEALS a microphone
     behind a chair, leads us to a mirror on a wall.  On the other
     side of the one-way glass a reel-to-reel tape recorder is
     picking up the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING.

     OUTSIDE

     The building the lovers are in SLOWLY RISES into the air, past
     taller buildings and floats out over the city.  Its shadow
     moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers.

     INSIDE

     White sleeps, as buildings move past outside the window.  He
     opens his eyes, FORCES himself awake.  Looks across the dark
     room.

     The JAPANESE WOMAN stands naked at the window, clutching a
     large red megaphone.  IN PERFECT ENGLISH she shouts down at the
     streets drifting past.

                         JAPANESE WOMAN
               He's up here!  He raped me!  Hurry!
               Before he kills again!

     OUTSIDE

     MYSTERY MEN stand on roof-tops, watching the building drift
     past.

     BACK IN THE ROOM

     White runs to the window, GRABS the woman.  As they struggle,
     the building is landing softly in another part of the city.

     LONG SHADOWS move towards the entrance...

     WHITE WAKES UP AGAIN  -  finds he is still on the couch.  NO
     SIGN of the woman.  Then he notices her standing by the window
     (minus megaphone).  The wind pulls at her black hair.  A
     distant SIREN O.S.

     He gets up, walks over, stands beside her, looks out at the
     dark city.  She ignores him, goes back to the couch, turns on a
     table-lamp, puts her hands before the lit bulb, casts animal
     shadows on the wall.

     White watches her.  He walks across and sits next to her.  She
     points to herself.

                         WOMAN  (a whisper)
               Sachiko.

     He nods slowly, looks at her.  She waits for him to respond
     with his name.  He shrugs, remains silent.  Then he puts his
     hands in the light, makes his own animal shadow.

                         WHITE
               That's me.  I'm a shadow.

     She smiles at the shadows.

                         WHITE
               Do I look like a murderer to you?

     She just keeps smiling, not understanding.  Kisses him. He
     notices an old phone on a corner table, removes the note again
     and rings the same number.  This time, after several rings the
     call is answered.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.
               Yes?...  Who is this?...  Who's
               there?...

     White remains silent.  Sachiko stands and leaves the room.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.
               John?  Is that you?

                         WHITE
               Who is this?  What do you know about
               me?

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko hesitates momentarily.
     She slides a hand into White's coat, removes the wallet.  She
     takes out some cash, puts the wallet back, then she MOVES OFF.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pulls up in his car.  Across the street is DOCTOR
     SCHREBER'S surgery.

     He is about to get out of the car, when the SURGERY DOOR OPENS
     and A FIGURE steps into the street.  Bumstead watches the
     shadowy man for a moment.  Then gets out and FOLLOWS, assuming
     it is Schreber.

     ALLEYWAY

     Bumstead follows inconspicuously.  Without warning, the figure
     stops and TURNS.  Bumstead backs into a doorway to hide.  He
     gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a MYSTERY MAN in the
     dim light of the alley.

     When Bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of
     the Man  -  like he disappeared into thin air.  A SHADOW
     crosses the wall beside Bumstead.  He spins, looking around
     behind him.  Then he looks up into the air.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The shadow of a LEVITATING FIGURE crosses the face of a
     building.


     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING PASSAGEWAY  -  NIGHT

     SOUND OF A WOMAN SOBBING O.S.  A wet dog sits in a corner
     gnawing a bone.  A crackly voice recites a list of names from a
     small speaker-box mounted to a wall.  A TREMBLING FINGER
     presses a door buzzer.

     SACHIKO, opens the door and looks out.

     ANGLE ON  -  A STRANGE WOMAN in the dark corridor adjusting her
     hair nervously.  She pushes past the Japanese woman, into the
     room.

     INSIDE

                         WOMAN
               John.

     WHITE stands inside the room, looking at the woman,
     expressionless. The woman suddenly leaps forward, grabs him,
     kisses him passionately.

     White tries to push her away, but she takes his hand, pulls it
     inside her dress, makes him touch her breasts.  He pushes
     harder, she trips on a chair, falls to the floor.  She starts
     to cry.


     EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING FACADE

     The CAMERA MOVES past flaking bricks  -  to a window.  Behind
     the glass WHITE and SACHIKO sit across from the WOMAN who
     attacked White.  She is talking, though nothing can be heard,
     drying her eyes with a handkerchief.

     INSIDE

     The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs.

                         WOMAN
               Please believe me.  It's me, John.
               Your WIFE.  I wouldn't lie to you.
               You told me I could come and see you
               -  now you want to just send me away
               again...

     White looks AT THE FLOOR.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  a crack in the floorboards  -  movement
     underneath.

                         WHITE
               I thought it would make more sense.
               I'm getting the pieces, but when I
               put it together it feels like...
               Like you're telling me about somebody
               else's life...

                         WIFE
               It's the truth...  I need you.  I
               know you're innocent.

                         WHITE
               How do you know I'm innocent?

                         WIFE
               Of course you are.  You couldn't do
               those terrible things.  Come home with
               me  -  maybe things will make sense
               then...

                         WHITE
               I can't do that.  It's dangerous.
               What about my parents?  Do you know
               where I can find them?

                         WIFE
               They're dead, John.

     He stands and walks to the window  -  looks out at the city.

                         WIFE
               You have an uncle.  You were very
               close.

     She fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles
     something on a piece of paper, hands it to White.

                         WIFE
               This is where he lives. I'm sure he
               would like to see you.

                         WHITE (taking paper)
               Thanks.

                         WIFE (looks at him for a beat)
               Don't you want me?   My body?
               Remember how my skin feels?  Touch
               it.  I...

     She notices Sachiko  -  becomes self-conscious.  Sachiko
     silently stands and leaves the room.  The wife puts her face in
     her hands, overcome with tears.

                         WHITE
               What's your name?

                         WIFE  (looks up  -  still sobbing)
               Elizabeth.

     White removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his
     wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face  -  it
     matches.

                         WHITE  (thoughtful)
               Yes...

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple.  She
     MOVES OFF.

                         ELIZABETH
               I want to help...

                         WHITE
               Alright.  Here...

     He pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman
     can see it.

                         WHITE
               Know this place?

     She looks at the card.

                         ELIZABETH  (stops crying)
               Of course.  Your home town  -  where
               you grew up...

     White stands abruptly, startling the woman.  He glares down at
     her intensely.

                         WHITE
               How do I get there?  Tell me.

                         WIFE
               That's easy.  You...

     She trails off into silence.  Her hand, about to point in a
     certain direction, freezes in mid-air.

                         ELIZABETH
               ...strange, I forgot.

     White sits back down quietly.

                         WHITE
               Yes.  Very strange.


     INT.  BATHROOM

     Sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of
     the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor.

     Underneath is a TRAP-DOOR.  Opening it, she climbs down a
     hole.

     UNDER THE FLOOR

     In the semi-darkness she moves to a WOODEN BOX.  She cranks a
     small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open.  Music
     plays softly.

     She looks into the yawning black mouth of the box.  A WORM-LIKE
     apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her
     thigh.  She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes.


     INT.  TENEMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR

     LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  -  feet walk along a tattered rug,
     approach a door.  Bumstead's shoes, shiny as always.


     INT.  TENEMENT ROOM

     A KNOCK ON THE DOOR startles a huddled man in a blanket,
     sitting before a small t.v. set.  This is THOMPSON  -  the
     detective with mental problems.  He's unshaven, haunted.

     Clutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy-
     hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Bumstead, back turned, glancing at his watch.

     Thompson backs away, points his gun at the figure through the
     door.

                         THOMPSON
               Go away!

                         BUMSTEAD O.S.
               Open up, Thompson.  It's me...

     Thompson puts his eye to the door again.

                         THOMPSON
               Bumstead?

     THROUGH THE SPY-HOLE LENS the inspector turns, looks at us, his
     face DISTORTED, fish-like.  Thompson undoes four locks, opens
     the door a crack, but leaves it chained.

                         THOMPSON
               Can't let you in...  sorry.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I'm on the serial killer case, need
               to talk.

                         THOMPSON
               Not that.  Anything else.

     Thompson wipes at the sweat on his forehead.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You don't look so well...  C'mon, let
               me in Thompson.

     Thompson stares at Bumstead, then silently unchains the door
     and lets him through.

                         THOMPSON
               I can't talk about that.  As long as
               you understand, that's all.

     The room is very dark.  Bumstead is assailed by a wave of
     putrid smells.  It's a mess  -  rotten food, overturned
     furniture, dirty clothes.

                         THOMPSON
               Pull up some garbage  -  make
               yourself at home.

     Thompson smiles weakly.  They sit down, face each other in the
     gloom.  A RAT scuttles past Thompson.  With lightning reflexes
     he throws a shoe at it.  The rat runs under a table.  He looks
     back at Bumstead, smiles, slightly insane.

                         THOMPSON
               They've taken my mind, my memories...

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?  Who has?

                         THOMPSON
               Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't
               remember...
                    (looks around)
               Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off
               this case.  Now.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is going on?

                         THOMPSON (looks more frightened)
               Wish I could tell you, Bumstead.
               Strange business.  I...
               AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!

     He screams horribly.  Stands, clutching his head.  Startled,
     Bumstead falls backwards off his chair.  Thompson, still
     clutching his head, runs and starts POUNDING HIS FACE against
     the wall.

                         THOMPSON
               Get away!  Leave me alone!

     Thompson's head is CHANGING  -  bloating.  It rapidly elongates
     into a pink fleshy tube.

     Thompson's head continues to grow -  his features are lost
     beneath folds of skin.  His screaming is stifled.  Thompson
     falls to the floor.  His head HUGE NOW  -  larger than his
     body.  Small tendrils sprout from the main appendage.

     Bumstead takes cover behind a sofa.

     Then, as violently as the head began to transform, it stops.

     Bumstead peaks over the sofa at the huge throbbing purple
     growth sprouting from Thompson's collar.  At the top of the
     growth an orifice opens.

     An EXPLOSION of green bile spouts into the room  -  covers
     everything in sight...

     Then the head starts to shrink.  Thompson's features appear
     again. It returns to normal size.  Thompson groans, sprawled on
     the floor, clutching his head.

     Bumstead looks on in horror.

                         THOMPSON
               It's  -  it's disgusting, I know...

     Thompson's face is heavily bruised, covered in sweat.  His nose
     starts to bleed  -  he wipes it on his sleeve.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jesus!  We have to get you to a
               doctor...

                         THOMPSON
               No...  No doctor...

     Bumstead stands unsteadily.

                         BUMSTEAD
               But...  How long has this been
               happening?

                         THOMPSON
               A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno,
               I can't remember.
                    (stands slowly)
               Worse thing is, I never know if it
               will change back again...  Now,
               please leave me alone.


     INT.  APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

     WHITE, ELIZABETH and SACHIKO sit around a small table, eating
     quietly.

     Without warning, Elizabeth starts to cry again.  White tries to
     ignore her. Sachiko looks sadly at the wife, puts a hand on her
     shoulder, gives her a handkerchief.  The woman quietens down.

     They resume eating but in no time Elizabeth again bursts into
     tears.  White looks at her now.

                         ELIZABETH  (through sobs)
               Sorry...

     Sachiko leans across and puts her arm around Elizabeth, helps
     her to her feet.  Elizabeth hangs onto the woman as she is led
     from the room.  White can hear the sobbing still, as the women
     move through to the bedroom.


     INT.  BEDROOM

     They sit on the edge of the bed  -  Sachiko holds Elizabeth's
     hand, smiles at her.

                         ELIZABETH (calmer now)
               I'm sorry...  This is embarrassing  -
               my husband doesn't know who I am...

     With this, she starts to cry again.

     Sachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses Elizabeth's lips.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON TWO MYSTERY MEN speaking in whispers.  The Men
     continue talking as THE CAMERA RISES, through several levels of
     concrete and machinery TO REVEAL:


     EXT.  ROOF-TOP  -  NIGHT

     OTHER MYSTERY MEN are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna
     device.

     BACK DOWN IN THE DARK CHAMBER

     The group of MYSTERY MEN have gathered once again.  One
     addresses them all.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               The line of junction between two
               edges!

                         MEN  (unison)
               YES!

                         MYSTERY MAN
               We have located him.  Now is the
               time, yes.

     A switch is thrown.  Electricity sparks to life.  A hum is in
     the air.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               Let the tuning commence!

     The congregation of MEN place ELECTRODES to their foreheads in
     a trance-like manner.  They chant, quietly at first, steadily
     building in volume.  The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to
     some inner beat.

     The CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.  A
     representation of a man's legs.  Trousers rolled up above the
     knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh.
     Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion
     -  the legends are an unknown language.

     ON THE ROOF

     The antenna glows with a ghostly green light.  O.S. SCREAMS
     RISE UP FROM THE STREET.


     INT.  APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  LATER

     White downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the
     window.  O.S. distant screams.

     He glances across to a wall, notices A FLY there  -  something
     about it looks WRONG.

     FLY'S P.O.V.

     A distorted electronic image of White's FACE looming up.

     At exactly that moment the FLY TAKES OFF, flies erratically
     down the hall, around a turn and disappears.  White follows.

     HALL-WAY

     White moves quietly towards the bedroom door.

     HIS P.O.V.

     It is ajar, dark inside.  Movement.  The women are naked on the
     bed.  The JAPANESE WOMAN has her eyes shut, head back in
     ecstasy. The WIFE is bent over her, kissing her stomach.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  watching through the crack in the door.  The
     women are oblivious.

     He moves away slowly, feeling strange.  His feet stop making
     contact with the floor.  He grabs a table to steady himself.
     The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and
     smash. He's FLOATING.

     White desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the
     light-fixture in the ceiling.  It breaks off in a cloud of
     plaster.  Sparks briefly illuminate.  He falls heavily ONTO THE
     CEILING  -  now the floor.  The apartment is upside down.

     He stares up at furniture and objects.

     THE BATHROOM

     White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing
     heater stuck to the floor.  Water is running  -  filling the
     tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's
     head.

     White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the
     floor.  It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off.
     Pulls himself towards the tub.

     Gravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water.
     He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath.  Submerges
     his face.  A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart
     somewhere in the building.

     He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A blurry DARK FIGURE moves into his vision.  It stares down at
     him.

     White rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the
     thin veil of water.  The FIGURE reaches out.  A GLOVED HAND
     grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully.  White
     gulps for air, swallows water.  His eyes widen.  He tries to
     stop the hand strangling him but can't.

     Suddenly the hand pulls away.  The BLURRY FIGURE stumbles back
     and ERUPTS into bloody explosion.  The body splits apart,
     throwing internal organs through the room.

     White awakens in the bathtub.  He looks about the room.  Empty.
     Silent.  He gets out of the water, starts to dress.


     EXT.  BUILDING

     BUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.  He gets out, stained here and there
     with bile.


     INT.  APARTMENT

     A HIGH ANGLE on the slain bodies of the JAPANESE WOMAN and
     WHITE'S WIFE.  TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing
     stuff.  Bumstead walks up to the cop in charge.

                         COP
               All the same entry wounds.  It's
               definitely him.
                    (indicates Sachiko's
                    corpse)
               She lives...  lived here.  A
               prostitute.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The other one?

                         COP
               His wife.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jesus.  Small world.
                    (looks around)
               Where's the photographer?

                         COP
               No one available.

     A third YOUNG COP steps up to the cop in charge, glancing at
     the bile on Bumstead's suit.

                         YOUNG COP
               They won't come out.

                         COP
               We'll interrogate them anyway.

     The cop leads Bumstead behind a WOODEN PARTITION.  A small area
     neatly arranged  -  a double bed, various possessions.  Someone
     obviously lives here.  The room is empty however.

                         COP
               This is the family of the victim  -
               apparently they were in the apartment
               when he committed...

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks around empty room)
               What are you talking about?

                         COP
               Oh, yes...

     He walks to THE BED, bends over and lifts the bed-spread.  In
     the shadows underneath, Bumstead can make out SEVERAL FACES.  A
     man, an old woman, three or four children.

                         COP
               They don't speak English...

                         BUMSTEAD
               How will we interrogate them?

                         COP
               Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.

     Under the bed, Bumstead can see a LITTLE GIRL.  He walks over
     to her.  She puts a hand over her mouth, edges away.

                         BUMSTEAD
               It's alright.  I won't hurt you.

     Without coming out from under the bed she hands the inspector a
     crumpled paper.  He looks at it then glances over his shoulder.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The wooden room divider.  The CAMERA MOVES IN steadily, into a
     crack running along the length of the divider  -  we can see
     the room on the other side, with the cops moving about.

     Bumstead looks back at the page he holds in his hands.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A child-like DRAWING.  Two men, stick figures, dressed in
     black, with impossibly big knifes, slash at two screaming
     women.

     Unmistakable  -  MYSTERY MEN.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     DOCTOR SCHREBER walks stiffly into the room and sits at the
     head of a boardroom table.  He's cold, pulls his coat up about
     his neck.  The long table is lined on both sides with immobile
     MYSTERY MEN.

     A DARK FIGURE walks into the room, steps up to the other end of
     the table.  This is the enigmatic MISTER BLACK  -  only ever
     seen hidden in shadow.

                         MISTER BLACK  (addressing Men)
               Gentlemen.
                    (peers at Schreber)
               Doctor.

     He sits, dark and mysterious.

                         MISTER BLACK
               I have called this meeting for a
               purpose, yes?
                    (turns to Schreber)
               It is clear to you we are  -
               unhappy, yes?

                         SCHREBER
               Yes, of course.  I...

                         MISTER BLACK
               The tuning failed  -  when our agents
               arrived he was gone.  He knows things
               -  predicts things.  Explain to us,
               Doctor.  Why is the situation this
               way?  Yes?

     Schreber seems distinctly uncomfortable.

                         SCHREBER
               I'm not certain I fully understand
               myself...

                         MISTER BLACK
               No excuses, dearest Doctor!  Answers.
               Yes?

                         MYSTERY MEN  (chant in unison)
               Answers!  Answers!

                         MISTER BLACK
               You said this would be containable!
               Nothing works this time.  Why is this
               so?

                         MYSTERY MEN
               Why!  Why!

                         SCHREBER
               I  -  ah  -  I...  it's a little cold
               in here don't you think?

                         MISTER BLACK
               We must find him.  This is your
               responsibility.

                         SCHREBER (thinking fast)
               Yes, of course...


     INT.  INSPECTOR'S OFFICE

     Bumstead once again scratches his head in front of a map.  The
     little girl's drawing is pinned to his board.  His attention
     wanders.  He notices a FLY CRAWLING across the wall in front of
     his face.  He leans closer, studying it.

     The intercom crackles to life.  The insect flies off.

                         MISS CRENSHAW  (through intercom)
               A call, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Who is it?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Put it through...

     A light flashes.  Bumstead picks up.

                         BUMSTEAD
               This is Bumstead.  Who is this?

     He listens intently.


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S OFFICE

     BUMSTEAD enters.  He looks nervous.  His SECRETARY sits at her
     desk in an adjoining office, filing her nails.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I need everything on the Jonathan
               White case.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  Everything?

                         BUMSTEAD
               All the important stuff.  Wrap it up
               for me.

     The inspector turns to face her, a little manic. She is staring
     at him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Please  -  I'm in a hurry.

                         MISS CRENSHAW (evenly)
               Certainly.


     EXT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD steps from the doorway and walks across to his car
     briskly.


     INT.  BATH-HOUSE

     Bumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels
     and swimming outfits, waiting silently.  They sit lined by a
     wall, staring into space.

     Bumstead walks into a larger tiled room, full of steam.  He
     walks beside a heated pool  -  naked people swim about weakly
     or sit on the edge washing themselves.  He steps up to A FULLY
     DRESSED MAN, sitting silently on a bench.  It is WHITE.

     A feint smile brushes across White's lips as he looks up at the
     inspector.  He looks away, like he's forgotten something.
     Stands, walks over to the pool, cups his hand, bends down,
     scoops some water.

     Bumstead sees White has picked up the LITTLE SILVER FISH.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why give yourself up?

                         WHITE
               I  -  ah - couldn't think of
               anything else to do.  I thought maybe
               you know something...
                    (beat)
               I'm scared.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That was a pretty good escape act at
               the station.  How did you do that?

                         WHITE
               I woke up in a subway.  I don't know
               how I got there.

                         BUMSTEAD  (not convinced)
               Uh-huh.
                    (pauses)
               What are you scared of?

                         WHITE
               People...  after me.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Who?

                         WHITE
               I don't know who they are.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why are they after you?

                         WHITE
               Don't know that either.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Don't know much, do you?


     INT.  LABORATORY  -  NIGHT

     Metal scraping.

     PIANO ACCORDION MUSIC wafts on a breeze, someone breathing.

     HIGH ANGLE  -  Down through an OPENING metal hatch.  A dim
     laboratory IS REVEALED  -  a maze of scientific instruments.
     Elongated shadows move about.

     MYSTERY MEN are hunched over something.  Behind them a
     diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain.

     MAN 1 bends across to a CONTROL PANEL, works a switch.  A small
     speaker in a metal box crackles to life.  SOUND OF DISTANT
     SURF.  A WOMAN'S VOICE:

                         VOICE
               What is your name...  What is your
               name...

     Wires lead from the metal box to a HUMAN BRAIN within a
     metallic container.  Electricity arches across electrodes.

     More sounds from the speaker:  WATER BUBBLING.  HIGH HEELS WALK
     DOWN STAIRS.  BED-SPRINGS.  LOVERS MOAN PASSIONATELY.

     MAN 2 steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their
     handiwork.

     A PUPPET-LIKE CREATURE is revealed.  Small  -  two and half
     feet tall.  The top of its head an open hatch containing the
     BRAIN.  Wires lead to this.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET'S EYES  -  They glance about the room. Its body
     is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces.

     MAN 1 shines a torch into the puppet's eyes.

     INSIDE ITS HEAD

     Gears turn, illuminated by the beam of the light.  The gears
     part slowly to reveal a small writhing INSECT screwed to a
     metal plate.

     MAN 2 shows the puppet PHOTOGRAPHS:  WHITE as he looks
     currently, shots of him as a teenager, a young boy, a baby.
     Photos of what we realise are his parents, standing on a
     seaside pier sirtiling and waving.  Where he went to school.  A
     red push-bike he owned as a boy.  His first sweetheart.  Then a
     photo of a young woman smiling  -  his WIFE.

     MAN 3 holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the
     puppet creature  -  MORE SOUNDS OF SURF...

     A FIGURE clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows.
     His pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane  -  a
     carved silver insect.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Man 3 steps up to
     him.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You have duplicated the personality,
               yes.

                         MAN 3
               It is ready.  The Doctor was most
               helpful.

     Mister Black turns towards the OTHER MEN.

                         MISTER BLACK
               I hear a clock in my head, and I like
               it!

                         MEN  (respond in unison)
               We hear clocks in our heads, and we
               like it!

                         MISTER BLACK
               A world in our likeness!

                         MEN
               A world in our likeness!

     The Men close the hatch in the top of the puppet's head.
     SQUEAK...  CLUNK!  The puppet tests out its MANY WEAPONS, a
     series of nasty-looking blades snap out of its small body, then
     retract.


     INT.  INSPECTOR'S APARTMENT

     Bumstead leads White through the front door, into a SITTING
     ROOM.  Everything is extremely neat and organized, plastic
     coverings on all the furniture.  White steps towards a sofa.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Please.  Not that way.  If you could
               just follow the covering  -  the
               carpet gets stained and it's
               impossible to clean.

     White stops. Bumstead indicates a CLEAR PLASTIC MAT running
     through the room.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Everything the department knows about
               John White is in this.  Here.
                    (hands file)
               Excuse me for a moment.

     White flips through it.  Details of White's history.

     IN THE BEDROOM

     Bumstead removes an empty suitcase from a closet.  Begins to
     place neatly folded clothes within it.

                         BUMSTEAD (calling to White)
               Age thirty one.  Brown hair.  Green
               eyes.  Five feet, ten and a half
               inches tall.  Until recently worked
               for a firm manufacturing scientific
               equipment.  Wife's name  -  Elizabeth.
               Father and mother  -  Harold and
               Edith.  Both dead.  A history of
               mental instability...  etcetera,
               etcetera.

     Bumstead walks back into the sitting room, packed bag in hand.
     He looks at White leafing through the file.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That stuff helpful?

                         WHITE  (disappointed)
               I suppose...
                    (looks up)
               Why are you helping me?

                         BUMSTEAD
               You're case has been driving me
               crazy.  You see, I pride myself on
               being thorough.  There's too many
               loose ends with your case.
                    (a beat)
               Thought it was best you were hidden
               until we understand more about the
               facts.  What do you know about these
               men in black?

     White looks up, pauses as if he didn't understand Bumstead,
     then:

                         WHITE
               If you shoot them here...
                    (points at his
                    forehead)
               you can kill them.  They're not
               people  -  like us  -  got insects in
               their heads...  Got any disinfectant?

     The inspector is caught off-guard by the question.

                         WHITE  (continues)
               It's my legs.  Been bitten.  Giving
               me trouble.

     Bumstead walks silently to the bathroom, opens a medicine
     cabinet.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to himself)
               Insects?

     He returns clutching a small bottle and some cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Here.
                    (hands things to
                    White)
               Careful with your trousers.  That
               stuff stains.

     The inspector gives white back his revolver and his wallet.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Here.

     Bumstead paces thoughtfully, careful to stay on the plastic
     protective covering.  He turns, glares at White, who dabs his
     legs with the cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Any idea what part the Doctor plays
               in this business?

     White shakes head.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Let's try and find out, shall we.
                    (points at White's
                    shoe)
               Lace is untied.

     White looks down.  Bumstead doesn't lie.


     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     The BARBER is shaving under the armpit of a client.  GRANDPA
     snores in a corner, his feet buried under a pile of hair
     clippings..

     The BELL hanging above the door rings.  The door swings open.

                         BARBER
               He with you shortly, sir...

     Several heads turn, THEN LOOK DOWN to see the PUPPET.  The
     puppet wheels forward and stops.

                         BARBER (not really looking)
               Hello, sonny.  Cute outfit.  Mother
               get it for you?

     The puppet crosses the room threateningly.  TWO OTHER CLIENTS
     look up startled from their newspapers and girly magazines.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  it wheels up to the barber's leg and GRABS HIS
     TROUSER with a mechanical claw.  The puppet holds out a PHOTO
     OF White.

                         PUPPET (incoherent obscenities)
               EEEEEEEEK...  AHHHHHHH!...
               SHHHHIIIITTTT!...  FUUUUCKER!!

                         BARBER (looks down, scared now)
               Huh?

     He's grabbed and THROWN into a nearby chair.  The puppet leaps
     onto the bench in front of him  -  he's frightened, so are the
     customers.

     Puppet wheels up and down on the bench in front of the
     customers  -  stopping to glance at individuals in a threatening
     manner, holding out the photo of white.

     It leans forward, spinning its blades  -  HAIR FLIES.  Screams
     o.s.

     The PUPPET retracts its weapons  -  COVERED in blood.  It
     wheels forward, through the door and into the street.

     THE CAMERA PANS to reveal a scene of complete carnage.  Blood
     covers the walls.  FOUR BODIES slumped about the room.  Each has
     an outlandish hairstyle.


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White looks at the inspector  -  street lights pass over his
     features.  Bumstead stares at the road.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I didn't tell you the entire reason I
               helped you.  It started with two
               little girls.  Twins.  Used to play
               with them when I was young.  Couldn't
               remember for the life of me what they
               looked like, then I understood why...

     He looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint.

                         BUMSTEAD
               They didn't have faces.

                         WHITE
               What?

                         BUMSTEAD
               That's right.  Just seamless flesh
               across the front of their heads.  No
               mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it
               that way.  Up until then they had
               been normal little girls in my
               memory.
                    (looks back at White)
               That's not all.  Once I started
               examining them, all sorts of things
               about my life, had...
               inconsistencies.  It was like a game.
               I would think about a person or a
               place, or an event.  Then I would
               turn the lights off.  Sit down in a
               comfortable chair...  And study each
               detail of this subject.

     He glances at White, then back to the road.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Everything was liquid beneath a thin
               surface that had always seemed solid
               to me...

     Bumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Is there anything you haven't told me
               about this business?  Even the most
               insignificant thing?

                         WHITE (thinking)
               No.  Nothing I can think of.
               Except...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Go on.

                         WHITE
               Well.  The only thing I've been
               certain of, all this time, is that I
               need to get to the ocean.  The point
               is no one seems to know how to get
               there.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...

     He trails off.  Shakes his head slowly.

                         BUMSTEAD
               We'll get to the bottom of this.  I
               mean it.


     INT.  SCHREBER'S SURGERY

     The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open
     suddenly.  White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the
     doctor before he can protest.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I met a friend of yours the other
               night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No
               hair.  Rather pale skin...

                         SCHREBER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That's surprising.  He was leaving
               your office at the time...

                         SCHREBER
               You are mistaken.

                         WHITE
               What are you hiding?

                         SCHREBER
               Nothing.  I don't know anything!

     BUMSTEAD removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face.

                         SCHREBER
               Please, they'll kill me...

                         BUMSTEAD
               I think it's time you introduced us
               to your little friends.


     EXT.  ALLEY  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an
     alleyway.

     Schreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall.

                         SCHREBER
               In there.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Just like that?

     The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall.

     Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the
     foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.  He
     unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.  He
     waves the other men forward.

     White and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the
     mat  -  it says:  WELCOME on it.

     A CORRIDOR

     Through the door  -  AN ELEVATOR.  There is only a down button.
     Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open.

     They step inside.  The doors close, the lift descends.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is this place?

                         SCHREBER
               You wouldn't believe me if I told
               you, Inspector.  Have patience  -
               you'll see for yourself.

     When the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK
     PASSAGEWAY.


     EXT.  LIBRARY  -  NIGHT

     The PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base
     of the building.  It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps
     repeatedly.  It looks down and shrieks with a string of
     mechanical obscenities.


     INT.  MYSTERY MEN'S UNDERWORLD

     WHITE and BUMSTEAD follow SCHREBER down a corridor to what
     appears to be an ancient crypt.  They enter a door  -  it has
     something written on it in a strange language.

     INSIDE IS A ROOM

     They stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light
     switch, suddenly White STOPS dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead
     turns to him.

                         WHITE
               Look.

     White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks.  On
     these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats -  that's not all.  Each hook
     carries A FACE.

     Bumstead and White step closer, look at the faces.  They seem to
     be elaborate, very life-like MASKS.

                         SCHREBER
               Put them on.

     White and the inspector look at each other, incredulous.

     OUTSIDE  -  THE CORRIDOR

     The door opens.  White, Bumstead and Schreber step out, wearing
     poorly fitting masks and coats  -  DISGUISED AS MYSTERY MEN.

     FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR

     The three men come across a small area with a raised platform,
     between arches.  A number of OPEN CARTS roll past on tracks  -
     the scene resembles some bizarre amusement-park ride.  The carts
     are numbered on the side  -  all of them empty.

                         SCHREBER
               Get in.  Hurry.

     White, Bumstead and Schreber hop aboard.  The cart takes them
     into a DARK TUNNEL, deeper into the secret underworld of the
     MYSTERY MEN.  They MOVE THROUGH a subterranean landscape of
     unexplained contraptions and bones.

                         WHITE
                    (to Bumstead)
               Where do you think this goes?

                         BUMSTEAD
               It sure isn't the fun-fair.

     The cart finally comes to a stop in a cave.  Bumstead, White and
     Schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway, as a LONG LINE OF
     MYSTERY MEN walk past them.

                         SCHREBER
               Follow me, and do exactly as I do.

     They join the end of the line, falling into step.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER

     The MEN, with WHITE, BUMSTEAD and SCHREBER in tow, enter and
     sit in a number of rows of wooden chairs.  White and the
     inspector do the same.

     MORE MYSTERY MEN appear in circular portals high up on the
     concrete walls.  ONE MAN faces the others at the front of the
     room.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1
               Eleven past eleven  -  the Night of the
               Eye.

     The seated Men start to CHANT.

                         MEN
               NIGHT OF THE EYE!  NIGHT OF THE EYE!

     A MAN in the front row stands.

                         MAN 2
               The Eye is too small for the head of
               the pin!

                         MAN 1
               Yes!

     ANOTHER MAN stands.  Next to the first, who sits again.

                         MAN 3
               What is it that floats on the water?
               The Eye!

                         MAN 1
               Indeed!

     So it goes around the room, each Man takes his turn announcing
     part of the strange ritual.  It will be White, Bumstead and
     Schreber's turn shortly.  White is worried, looks at the
     others.

                         WHITE (whisper)
               What do we do?

                         SCHREBER (hisses back)
               Fake it!

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?

     SCHREBER is next  -  he stands abruptly.

                         SCHREBER
               The eye.  Master of time and space!

     Then it's Bumstead's turn.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The Eye  -  um  -  delicious with
               horseradish on rye!

     MAN 1 at the front seems confused for a moment  -  SEVERAL of
     the others turn towards Bumstead.

                         MAN 1 (uncertain)
               Good.

     The inspector sits back down  -  whispers to White without
     looking at him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Nothing to it...

     White stands.  Hesitates.  Then:

                         WHITE
               Eye...  eye, captain!

     White sits down, shaking his head, embarrassed.

                         MAN 1
               Um  -  yes...

     THE MAN NEXT TO WHITE rises up  -  keeps rising, FLOATS IN THE
     AIR above the Men's heads.

                         MAN 4
               My spine will bend for the Eye!

     He turns sideways, still floating.


     EXT.  ALLEY

     BACK ABOVE GROUND, Bumstead, White and Schreber run from the
     door at the end of the alley-way, tossing their masks away.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Was that for real down there?

                         SCHREBER
               I'm afraid so.

     The inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him
     back.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What the hell is that?

     At the end of the alley the PUPPET advances menacingly.
     Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and
     disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Quick.  My car.

     Fortunately BUMSTEAD'S CAR stands nearby.  The two men leap in,
     start it up.  Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the
     glare of the headlights.

     The puppet's head opens, a TINY PROPELLER pops out, spins,
     lifting the puppet into the air.  The car passes beneath it at
     speed.  Screeches off into a street, races along between tall
     buildings.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE
               What now?

                         BUMSTEAD
               This ocean business...  I know where
               I can find a map.  I need to go back
               to the station.  Where will you be?

     White thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him
     from his pocket.

                         WHITE
               I'll go see an uncle of mine.
                    (reading)
               Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double
               six  -  three...

     Bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with
     the wheel, driving at breakneck speed.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good.
                    (looks in rear
                    mirror)
               Uh-oh...

     White turns and looks behind them.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  HEADLIGHTS gaining on them.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  sitting AT THE WHEEL of a stolen car, driving
     like crazy.

     BACK IN BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White takes out his gun  -  AIMS at the rapidly approaching
     car.

                         WHITE  (remembers)
               It's empty.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Take mine.

     Bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat.  They swap.

     The puppet PULLS ALONGSIDE, a mechanical arm extends towards
     Bumstead's front tire.  A SPINNING BLADE extends from the end
     of the mechanical arm.

                         PUPPET
               ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...  HA-HA-HA-HA-
               HA!!

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel.  White
     fires.  Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows.

     THE BLADE cuts into the tire  -  it pops loudly, goes flat,
     metal SPARKS off the road.

     White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash.  Bumstead
     fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other
     vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans
     flying.

     The PUPPET'S car falls behind  -  then swerves off into a side-
     street and disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks behind him)
               Where did it go?

                         WHITE  (looks back also)
               Don't know.

     Both look FORWARD AGAIN  -  to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in
     front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY.  Bumstead's car is going too
     fast.  Slams the brakes.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET  -  Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car
     approaches like a bullet.

     INSIDE INSPECTOR'S CAR

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jump!

     Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad.  The two men LEAP.

     The car continues onwards.

     CRASH!  KA-BOOM!

     In the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves
     up from different sides of the street.  Look at each other,
     turn and head in OPPOSITE directions.

     CAMERA MOVES IN on mangled metal  -  a MECHANICAL CLAW starts
     to pull itself from the wreckage.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps up to a SMALL DOOR in the side of a building.  A
     sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with
     fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface.  Dominating
     everything is a GREEN MAN with scales  -  a KING NEPTUNE-type.

     INSIDE

     White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue
     curtain.  In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth
     hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window.  The
     man wakes with a start.

                         TICKET SELLER
               Yeah.  That's what I said!
                    (looks at White  -
                    rubs head)
               What..?

                         WHITE
               I'm looking for this address.

     The man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily.

                         TICKET SELLER
               Upstairs.  Through there.

     He thumbs the blue curtain.  Curls up, shuts his eyes again.

     BEYOND THE CURTAIN

     A dark room full of BUBBLING NOISES AND WATER DRIPPING  -  an
     aquarium.

     Several corridors meander between large glass panels that look
     into illuminated tanks of sea creatures.

     White moves past a shadowy doorway.  He can barely make out
     STAIRS.


     INT.  HALL-WAY

     White moves cautiously in the darkness.  On a door a tiny
     NAMEPLATE says:  K. WHITE.  The door is unlocked.  He opens it
     and goes in.

     INSIDE

     An entrance hall of an apartment.  A large number of MOUNTED
     FISH of all sizes line the hall.

     PHOTOS on the wall  -  family portraits.  White examines these,
     concentrates on one in particular  -  a young boy on a red push-
     bike, in the background a sign with a faded image of a girl in
     a bathing suit:  WELCOME TO BLUMBVILLE!  it says.

     A strange WHIRRING NOISE O.S.  White hides behind a sofa.
     Whatever is making the whirring noise moves past slowly.  White
     cannot see what it is.

                         VOICE O.S.
               John?

     White turns to see an OLD MAN in his pyjamas sitting in a
     WHEELCHAIR.  The man pushes a lever on the side of the chair.  A
     whir of electric motors.  The chair carries him out of the
     shadows.  White steps from behind the sofa.

                         MAN
               Are you alright?  What are you doing
               here?  Is this one of your jokes,
               John?  It's been so long, I thought
               you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?

                         WHITE
               Uncle...  Karl.


     INT.  AIR-CONDITION DUCT

     A P.O.V.  -  MOVING THROUGH a dark, claustrophobic pipe.
     TWISTING around tight corners, DARTING down straight lengths of
     ducting.  Dim light spills from wire grills spaced along the
     walls.

     WE TRAVEL up to one grill, at the end of a long stretch of
     tunnel  -  stop, nowhere left to go. We can see through the gaps
     in the wire, looking down into...

     THE ROOM

     White and uncle Karl are having a SLIDE-SHOW.  Shots of a recent
     vacation  -  the uncle doing a series of mundane things.

                         KARL (chuckling)
               Not often I get a chance to show
               these.

     He changes the slide:  an image of him standing against a brick
     wall.

                         KARL
               And this is me again about  -  um  -  I
               would guess about twelve feet further
               to the right of the last shot.  Now
               just behind the wall is the hotel I
               stayed at  -  sweet little place...

     The PHONE RINGS.  Uncle Karl wheels over, picks up the receiver.

                         KARL (talks down the line)
               Hello...  Yes, he's here...
                    (holds out the phone
                    to White)
               It's for you.

     White concerned  -  takes the phone.

                         WHITE
               Yes?
                    (he listens)
               Oh, it's you...  Yes...  My uncle
               apparently...  Just looking at some
               memories...  You have?  That's good.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     Bumstead talks to White on the phone.  He stands in a dark
     room, surrounded by charts and maps.

                         BUMSTEAD
               At first I thought there was no way
               to get to the ocean...  The buildings
               are a barrier, no windows, no doors
               -  everything just, well, ends  -  only
               thing would be drill a hole.  But
               then, I saw it, one door, just one...
               Inside a tenement building...

     Bumstead is interrupted by a NOISE O.S.  He looks to a frosted
     partition  -  dark figures walk past on the other side.  He
     quickly sorts through SEVERAL MAPS, making as little noise as
     he can.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)
               We can meet later  -  but first I
               have to do something.  Look I got to
               go...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     White holds THE PHONE, listens to Bumstead on the other end.

                         WHITE
               Where can we meet?...  Alright.
               Good...

     As White hangs up he notices A DOOR behind a big old crockery
     cupboard.  The cupboard has been pushed up against the wall,
     hiding the door.

     BACK IN THE POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD quickly folds the map and shoves it into his pocket.
     As he turns and runs from the room we NOTICE A DARK FIGURE
     standing behind a shelf in the room.

     IN UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     UNCLE KARL continues to change slides  -  the noise echoing
     about the room.  White moves over and sits down next to him.

                         KARL
               Look!  This is a good one!

                         WHITE
               What is that door?

                         KARL
               Which one?

                         WHITE
               There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where
               does it go?

     The uncle watches the slides.

                         KARL
               Such a joker!  Like your father.

                         WHITE
               No.  Have a look.

     He leads the old man over to the cabinet.

                         WHITE
               You see it?

                         KARL
               Yes.

                         WHITE
               Where does it lead?

                         KARL
               It must be a closet or something.

     White pushes at the cabinet.  The old man helps.  They only
     manage to push several inches  -  it is very heavy.  White
     decides to just climb over it.  He squeezes through, opens the
     door and climbs a set of dark stairs.  Uncle Karl watches.

                         KARL
               Don't trip over.  It's dark up there.


     INT.  ATTIC  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a light switch  -  it is flipped.

     AN ATTIC  -  full of books, boxes, discarded possessions.
     White picks up a book and opens it  -  the pages have been
     eaten out by a swarm of ROACHES.  He drops it in disgust as the
     insects scurry over his hands.

     In a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great
     interest.  At the bottom of the box he finds a SMALL DOG-EARED
     DRAWING BOOK.  On the cover is a colourful scrawl in child's
     writing  -  a title:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     White sits down and flips through the book in the dim light.
     Page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings.
     As he reads segments from the book he seems more and more
     disturbed.  He flips through faster and faster.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Pages flip past, stopping occasionally.  Glimpses of DIAGRAMS.
     The MYSTERY MEN and THEIR WORLD.  Cross-sections of the MYSTERY
     MEN, the cavity in their head with the INSECTS INSIDE clearly
     illustrated.  EVERYTHING.

     PUSH IN CLOSE on White.  He looks up, STUNNED.


     INT.  UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     White emerges from the attic, clutching the small book to his
     chest, lost in thought.  He steps quietly into a hall-way  -
     notices the old man putting THE PHONE back on its cradle.

                         KARL
               John, I didn't see you there.

     A NOISE O.S. White and Uncle Karl turn.  A VENTILATION GRILL
     falls off a wall, revealing a hole.  EYES shine from the
     darkness.

     THE PUPPET leaps from the hole.  Its blades unfolding,
     spinning wildly before it hits the carpet.  It faces the two
     men.

                         KARL
               What is that?

                         WHITE (to Karl)
               Get back!

                         KARL
               Filthy beast!  Shoo!  Go on!  Shoo!

     He wheels forward, attempting to scare the puppet off.

                         WHITE
               No!

     The puppet goes for Uncle Karl.  A whirr of metal, BLOOD
     SPLASHES ACROSS WHITE and the walls.  Uncle Karl SCREAMS
     horribly.

     White grabs a chair  -  holds it above him.  The puppet turns
     from the dead man in the wheelchair.  White lets it have it.
     The chair CRASHES DOWN, splintering into pieces.

     The puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers.  White has a
     fire-poker now.  As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting
     with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall.
     White runs out the door.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     He leaps into a waiting elevator.  Pushes the top floor button.

     THE ELEVATOR SHAFT  -  The elevator moves upwards.

     INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     White looks through the circular window in the door.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  Floor after floor SLIDES PAST  -  deserted.  He
     looks at the floor indicator.  TIGHT ON NUMBERS lighting up:
     86, 87, 88...

     Then the elevator stops, the doors open, looking down a dark
     corridor.  The PUPPET is at the end.  It turns to face him,
     SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD, a horrible high-pitched shriek from its
     mechanical voice box.

     White STABS the buttons of the elevator frantically, the doors
     won't close.  The puppet is upon him.  He JUMPS, straight up.
     It goes under him, CRASHING INTO the back of the elevator.
     White hits the down button one last time, and leaps out of the
     compartment AS THE DOORS CLOSE.

     A MECHANICAL extendible arm shoots out and grabs White around
     the ankle. DRAGS him across floor.  THE PUPPET shrieks wildly
     again, as...

     ITS ARM  -  is JAMMED in the closing doors now.  Lift descends.
     The puppet squeals.  The arm SNAPS OFF.

     White stands, pulls dislocated arm off his ankle.  He can hear
     the elevator descending.  Suddenly it STOPS  -  starts
     returning to his floor.  White turns and runs again.

     The lift doors BURST OPEN  -  the ENRAGED CREATURE emerges and
     races after him.

     He tears around a corner  -  finds himself in a dead-end.
     Nowhere to go.  He can hear the puppet approaching along the
     corridor.  Suddenly he notice A GRILL on a wall ABOVE HIS HEAD.
     He pulls it off, climbs into an incredibly tight pipe.  Crawls
     frantically.

     He sees a LIGHT ahead.  An opening.  He kicks the grill off.  A
     sudden gust of wind.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The pipe leads to the outside of the building  -  nowhere to go
     except a hundred stories STRAIGHT DOWN.  He screams, almost
     falls.  Turns to start crawling back.

     Suddenly the end of the pipe fills with WHIRRING METAL BLADES.
     The puppet has followed him in and is advancing.

     No choice  -  he looks out the hole.  SEES A PIPE on the
     outside of the building, running vertically near the opening.
     It looks impossible but it's his only chance.

     He climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening,
     REACHES for the pipe.  The puppet is almost upon him.  He
     swings across, gets a HAND on the pipe.  He slips, DANGLES  -
     holding on  -  one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole.
     The pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it.

     SUDDENLY he hears a MECHANICAL CLICKING  -  TURNS to see the
     puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand.
     A soft noise reverberates in its voice box  -  a mechanical
     giggle?  A circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves
     down onto White's HAND.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYES  -  sweat beads and runs down his forehead.

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE  -  as it cuts into flesh.  BLOOD spatters
     White's face as he grimaces with intense pain.  He can't hold
     on.

     HE FALLS, plummets through space.  Screaming.


     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     A GROUP OF SURGEONS stand about BUMSTEAD'S MOTHER on her life-
     support machinery.  The surgeons have face-masks on and are in
     deep shadow.  The woman stares blankly, still in a coma.

     IN THE RECEPTION AREA

     BUMSTEAD looks up from his wristwatch.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I can't wait any longer...

     He is standing in front of the MALE NURSE in the glassed-in
     counter.

                         NURSE
               I'm sorry.  I told you, she is being
               examined...

     He turns and storms off down the corridor.  The NURSE stands,
     shouting after him.

                         NURSE
               Mister Bumstead!

     INSIDE MOTHER'S ROOM

     One of the "doctors" leans down and grabs a handful of WIRES
     leading out of a box beside the woman.

                         SURGEON
               We will teach the pig to meddle in
               our affairs.  Yes.

     He pulls the wires out in a burst of electrical sparks  -  ALL
     THE MACHINES DIE.  The woman comes to life momentarily, starts
     to claw at the glass shield in front of her face, like she is
     suffocating.  The life drains from her weak body and she is
     STILL.

     ANGLE ON THE DOOR  -  it bursts open.  Bumstead is standing
     there.  The masked surgeons are startled, they turn rapidly to
     face him.

                         BUMSTEAD (steps forward)
               What is happening?

                         SURGEON
               Ah, Inspector Bumstead!  We are glad
               you are here  -  I'm afraid we have
               done all we can.  Yes.  Your Mother
               has passed.  Yes.

     Bumstead turns towards his mother.

                         BUMSTEAD
               But she was getting better...

                         SURGEON
               We are sorry.  The cancer  -  it was
               fatal.

     Bumstead turns to the men, confusion in his eyes.

                         BUMSTEAD
               She doesn't have cancer.

     The men glance at each other for a moment, then back at the
     inspector.

                         SURGEON
               We knew that.  Yes.
                    (the other men nod)
               Anyway  -  she is dead.

     Bumstead leaps forward, RIPS OFF one of the surgeon's masks.

     ANGLE ON THE MAN  -  He turns to look at Bumstead, pale skin,
     staring eyes, a MYSTERY MAN.  TWO OTHER MEN grab him from
     behind.

                         BUMSTEAD (struggles)
               I'll kill you all!

     One of the Mystery Men steps up to the struggling inspector,
     places the palm of his hand across Bumstead's eyes.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You will obey us, yes.  In your mind
               there is a dark space...

     TIGHT ANGLE

     Bumstead's hand reaches out, fumbles at a tray of surgical
     implements, grabs a SCALPEL.

     WIDER

     He cuts into the hand of one of the Men holding him, SPINS AND
     DRIVES the scalpel into the forehead of the Mystery Man
     attempting to hypnotise him.

     The other Men leap towards him.


     EXT.  CANAL  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE

     His eyes are shut tight.  He opens them, slowly LOOKS AROUND,
     curious why he isn't dead.

     WIDER ANGLE

     White floats in MID-AIR, hovering ten feet or so above a dark
     body of water.  He looks amazed.  Shuts his eyes, rubs them,
     opens them again.  Still floating.

     He clenches his fists and TENSES his body.  Slowly he starts to
     MOVE FORWARD, hovering at an even height over the water.

     WIDER STILL

     SEVERAL ANGLES feature the figure of White levitating across
     the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  He comes to a stop.  Smiles in amazement.
     Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has
     opened beneath him.

     ANGLE ON BUBBLES floating to the surface.  White's FACE rises
     slowly out of the water.

     WIDER  -  CITY SKYLINE

     A SMALL OBJECT floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny
     white parachute.

     BACK ON WHITE

     He swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself
     silently through the still canals of the city.


     EXT.  HARBOUR

     Oil tankers move silently through inky water.

     White paddles the boat to the bottom of A PIER, climbs a rotten
     ladder.  He runs off into the shadows.

     BACK IN THE WATER

     The PUPPET cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear
     propeller.  It reaches the pier, climbs to the top.  The prop
     retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a
     concrete surface.  It looks around  -  it knows White is there
     somewhere.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     A trail of WET FOOTPRINTS on the ground.  It follows them, is
     led to a crane cabin.

     INSIDE THE CRANE'S CABIN  -  is White, a lunatic grin on his
     face, at the controls.

     A NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.  It looks up.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     Follows the crane up into the air.  The crane is swinging around
     against the dark sky.  A HUGE METAL CONTAINER dangles, stops
     above the puppet.

     ON WHITE

                         WHITE
               Nice knowing you.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S HAND  -  It pulls a lever.

     THE CONTAINER  -  Shakes and starts to fall.

     THE PUPPET  -  Screams up at the plummeting container.

     WIDER

     The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature.

     Silence.  Dust floats in the air.


     EXT.  STREET

     BUMSTEAD's running.  He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash
     in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn  -  but he made it
     out alive...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOF-TOP

     BUMSTEAD sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing
     heavily  -  he's losing a lot of blood.

     He waits.

     A NOISE O.S. startles him  -  A FIGURE in the shadows across the
     roof.

                         BUMSTEAD
               White?

     It's too big to be White.  The man steps from the shadows.

                         STROMBOLI (walking forward)
               Hello, Bumstead.

     He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector.  Bumstead lies
     bleeding, against the wall.  He points his own gun at the
     advancing man and pulls the trigger.

     CLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit.

     Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away,
     picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall.  Without
     Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why do you always have to find things
               out the hard way!  Couldn't you just
               do your job, you idiot?  I told you,
               didn't I?  These people are not
               playing games, Bumstead.  They can do
               anything they want, don't you
               understand?

                         BUMSTEAD (a hiss)
               You're one of them.  You bastard...

                         STROMBOLI (laughing)
               In a way, we all are, inspector!
               You.  Me.  Everybody!

     Stromboli carries Bumstead towards the EDGE of the roof.  He
     keeps laughing.

                         STROMBOLI
               Time for that early retirement,
               Bumstead.  Didn't bring the gold watch
               I'm afraid.

                         BUMSTEAD (weakly)
               No...  Please...

     INSPECTOR'S P.O.V.

     THE EDGE looms up  -  a long drop to the street.


     EXT.  STREET

     White paces nervously through empty streets.  He stops, to get
     his bearings, then turns and runs into:

     A SILHOUETTED FIGURE in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels.
     A skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm.  An inhuman
     moan.

     Terrorised, White pulls back.

                         FIGURE
               Ahhh...  it hurts!...

     The mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall.  A
     streetlight reveals...

     DOCTOR SCHREBER covered in blood, encased in a metal framework
     covered in silver blades.

                         WHITE
               What happened to you?

                         SCHREBER
               I'm...  being...  punished.

     The blades are connected to the wheels  -  they turn when he
     moves forward, metal cuts into his flesh, slowly SKINNING HIM
     ALIVE.  A torture machine.  Between screams of intense pain, the
     doctor speaks.

                         SCHREBER
               I had to  -  ahhhh  -  find you...  I..
               I...

     The doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his
     face.
                         WHITE
               What is it?

                         SCHREBER
               We are...  living in their dreams...

     Schreber turns and rolls off into the night, screaming  -  BLADES
     SPIN furiously, peeling back flesh.  He glances at White one
     last time.

                         SCHREBER
               Insect...  dreams...


     EXT.  STREET

     WHITE is running.  As he approaches the building he hears a
     scream  -  looks up to see a figure PLUNGE OFF the roof.

     He runs over.  Looks down at the twisted body.  THE INSPECTOR
     moans  -  barely alive.  White kneels by his side.

     BUMSTEAD'S hand moves across to an expanding POOL of red beside
     him, traces an 'H' on the ground in the blood.

                         WHITE (reading)
               Aitch?

     The inspector seems to be dying, then revives momentarily, puts
     A MAP in white's hand, looks up at him:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Gesundheit!

     His eyes roll up and he GOES LIMP.  White stares at the body,
     then:

                         WHITE
               I didn't sneeze.


     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     The MORTICIAN turns off the lights in the main hall and steps
     into his office, sits down, pours himself a hot drink; turns on
     the radio, opens his conic-book.

     A NOISE O.S. disturbs him and he gets up, walks out of his
     office, looks into the darkness.

     HIS P.O.V. PANS around the empty morgue.  Nothing.  Decides to go
     back to his office.  He turns and is startled by three MYSTERY
     MEN obstructing his path.

                         MAN 1
               We are looking for the White victims.

                         MORTICIAN
               And who the hell are you?

     The mortician catches a glimpse of the shiny dagger Man 1 is
     clutching by his side.  He becomes very scared.

                         MORTICIAN
               Over there.  Numbers eight to twelve.

     THREE MEN look over to where the mortician has pointed in
     unison.  Man 1 looks back.

                         MAN 1
               Thank you.

     A FLASH OF STEEL.  The mortician's throat SPOUTS blood.  He grabs
     reflexively at the gash and falls back onto the floor, DEAD
     before he hits the tiles.

     The Mystery Men step to an adjoining chamber.  Man 2 puts down a
     Box he is carrying, opens the lid.  A green glow oozes out.  The
     other Men manipulate levers on a control panel on a nearby
     wall.  Stainless steel doors open.  Body-length trays slide into
     the dim light.  SHAPES covered in white sheets.

     Man 2 with the box removes a GLASS SYRINGE, filled with a
     glowing green liquid.  He steps TO THE BODIES and injects each
     with the syringe, through the sheets.  When he has finished he
     steps back, places the syringe back in the box.  The MEN leave
     silently.

     All is silent and still.

     Then the shape beneath a sheet starts to SIT UP.  Then another,
     and another.


     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     WHITE is running again, clutching BUMSTEAD'S MAP.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP

     REVEALS the entire corridor.  KEEPS PULLING BACK  -  until the
     view is impossibly wide  -  like a cross-section of the building
     he's in, a doll's house with the roof taken off.  The TINY
     FIGURE runs, amidst a dark network of surrounding rooms and
     passages.

     CONTINUE PULL BACK

     White is no more than a SPECK  -  the hall-way stretches
     ENDLESSLY in both directions, behind and in front of the moving
     figure, through an infinite labyrinth.

     WIDER STILL

     We no longer make out the figure.  The x-rayed environment
     resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city  -  the
     corridor an ever increasing SPIRAL.


     INT.  ORNATE APARTMENT BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     White reaches the top of a spiral flight of stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     APARTMENT 'H'  -  a rusted metal letter on the door.  White steps
     forward.  He knocks once and the door creaks open, unlocked.

     INSIDE

     The rooms are empty, derelict, strewn with rubbish.  Mould grows
     on the damp walls.  A door stands at the end of a long empty
     room.  He can hear the muffled sounds of SURF, SEAGULLS.  White
     starts to walk forward, smiling.  As he approaches the door he
     begins to feel colder.

     He opens the door and looks out.  A blast of SUNLIGHT  -  blue
     ocean and sky.

                         VOICE O.S.
               John White...

     White does not turn about, he takes a step forward, then
     another  - and RUNS INTO THE SKY  - A PAINTED WALL. He glances up
     at a small SPEAKER built into the wall  -  the SOURCE of the sea-
     side SOUND EFFECTS.

     He hears the click of the gun being cocked behind him.  Hopes
     dashed, he turns.  ANGLE ON A MYSTERY MAN  -  a gun pointed at
     White's stomach.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               There is nothing, Mister White.
               Beyond the city.  Never has been.
               Unfortunate.  Yes?

     White is led into a pitch black room.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE  -  In the darkness  -  he looks across to
     the Mystery Man standing beside him.

                         WHITE
               How did you know where to find me?

                         MYSTERY MAN
               We knew you would turn up here
               eventually...  Been waiting for you,
               yes.  Hoped you wouldn't make a
               nuisance of yourself on the way...

     The Man motions with the gun for White to walk forward.  As soon
     as White turns to do this, the Man slips from the room and
     shuts the door, cutting off any existing light.

     A NOISE O.S.  -  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights
     start to come up all over the room.

     It's a normal, average-sized, living room.  All the furniture
     has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums  -  an
     arrangement resembling an IMPROVISED COURT of law.  In fact,
     White realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box.

     The apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a
     door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the
     kitchen) and a series of figures step through.  MYSTERY MEN.

     All the MEN take up specific positions around the room, without
     uttering a word, but don't sit.  One MYSTERY MAN opens a curtain
     beneath an arched entrance  -  beyond it, within a very small
     room, stand DOZENS OF PEOPLE, crammed shoulder to shoulder.  The
     people stare at White silently  -  a bizarre gallery of
     spectators.

     An eerie silence falls on the room.

     The kitchen door opens again.  White is shocked to see the
     VICTIMS WALK INTO the room and adopt positions in what is
     obviously the area for the jury.

     The DISEMBOWELED CORPSE OF A WOMAN steps out of the shadows,
     pushing a pram.  Her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white
     sheet.

     Within the pram is the BABY clutching its own head, with spine
     attached, under its arm.

     Then the mutilated FREDRICK hops out, followed by the three
     brown blood-stained paper parcels containing what is left of
     the YOUNG BOY.

     Finally, his WIFE and the JAPANESE WOMAN, still in passionate
     embrace, take their positions.

     Another door opens  -  a closet. Within stands the figure we have
     only seen as a shadow  -  the elderly MYSTERY MAN with the cane.
     MISTER BLACK slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain
     hanging from the ceiling  -  the light snaps on inside the
     closet.  Somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a
     toilet is heard flushing.

     He is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority
     as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting
     his withered body on his cane.  Looks like he will play JUDGE.

     Everyone in the room now sits.  Mister Black looks at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear,
     but cold.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Welcome.

     White just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook
     called:  ANSWERS.

                         MISTER BLACK
               John White, you are to be tried for
               murder, yes.  You wish to confess to
               these crimes now?

     White is silent.  He leans over and scratches his legs through
     the fabric of his trousers.  They itch like crazy.

     Mister Black turns to the assembled people.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Very well.  The testimony of the
               prosecutors.  Yes.

     TWO MYSTERY MEN stand and step across to a wooden easel.  MAN 1
     stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc.
     drawn on stiff cardboard.  MAN 2 uses a pointer while he
     describes the evidence to support their case.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               We will show that John White is
               abnormal, a menace to society, a
               dangerous sick individual, and that
               the court should have no mercy in
               finding him guilty and punishable to
               the extreme for his crimes.

     MAN 1 places a large black and white photo blow-up on the
     easel.  It shows White at the door of the JAPANESE WOMAN'S
     apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1
               Exhibit A shows the accused leaving
               the scene of his most recent crime,
               yes.  A photo taken by a remote camera
               planted by one of our agents.

     White watches in stunned silence.

     A general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is
     made.  Mister Black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               Exhibit B...

     MAN 1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to MAN 2.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               Actual tape recording of accused
               committing aforementioned crime, yes.

     He turns a switch, the reels spin slowly.  A hush fills the
     room.

                         VOICE 1 (sounds like JAPANESE WOMAN)
               No...  Please...

     A scream.

                         VOICE 2 (sounds like White)
               Shut up!

     Another scream.  A ripping sound.

                         VOICE 3 (sounds like his WIFE)
               John!  Don't...

     Another scream.

     White is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this
     any longer.

                         WHITE (a squeak, almost inaudible)
               Stop it!  This is a lie...

     Mister Black turns to White.  The Men testifying stop the tape
     and look at him also.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Something to say?  Ready to confess?

     The Men in the audience turn and all stare at White, as do the
     victims and the spectators in the adjoining room.

                         WHITE (back to a whisper)
               I didn't kill anyone.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Speak up.  Yes.

                         WHITE (finds his voice)
               It's lies.  Everything.

     He grips the barrier before him.

     A SHRIEK from the pram containing the BABY  -  it rocks violently
     from side to side.

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN rises from her chair.  She has difficulty
     standing, her limbs stiff.  She looks at White, opens her mouth
     to say something, but no sound comes out.  Instead a tiny RED
     CRAB scuttles out, across her face, and falls to the ground.
     She sits down.

     White is stunned.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Bring the witnesses.

     AN OLDER COUPLE are led out of the kitchen by a Mystery Man.
     Shown to seats behind a podium.  The woman looks sadly at White.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You are the accused's parents?

                         FATHER
               That's right.

                         MOTHER
               Yes.

                         WHITE
               Wait a minute...

                         MISTER SLACK
               You had your turn!  Let them speak.

                         WHITE (angry)
               My parents are supposed to be dead!
               You can't keep changing the damn
               rules like this!  Why go through this
               ridiculous set-up!  Why don't you
               just kill me and be done with it!

                         MISTER BLACK (smiles at parents)
               Please, continue...

                         WHITE
               This is insane!

     He looks over to the victims.

                         WHITE
               It was them, not me.
                    (points at the
                    Mystery Men)
               They killed you.

     Looks back at the Mystery Men.

                         WHITE
               You have invented all this.  History
               is a lie, not just mine, everyone's  -
               a fiction.  You are the authors.

     His knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier.

                         MISTER BLACK
               A fanciful idea, Mister White.

                         WHITE
               Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each
               one teaches you more about your
               invention.  I'm what is called a
               murderer.

     The whole court listens in silence to White's testimony.

                         WHITE
               You've given everybody memories, but
               I missed out.  The Doctor saw to that
               -  played your own game.  And now...

     WHITE looks at the MYSTERY MEN, then back at MISTER BLACK.

                         WHITE
               You're trying to get rid of me.

     There is silence.  Whispers.  Faces staring.

                         WHITE
               Why do I threaten you?  You're scared
               aren't you?

     MISTER BLACK and the gathered MYSTERY MEN look speechless at
     White.  Suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous LAUGHTER, led
     by Mister Black.

     A terrible cackle fills the room  -  all the MYSTERY MEN laugh
     hysterically, so do the mutilated victims.  The spectators in
     the adjoining room remain silent.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Ah  -  a plot.  Now we have a plot!
                    (chuckling)
               Very inventive...

     The older couple behind the podium look disturbed.

                         MOTHER
               Please, John, you're embarrassing
               us...

                         WHITE
               Shut up!

                         MISTER BLACK (chuckling still)
               You have proof?  Evidence?  Yes?

                         WHITE (holds up notebook)
               It's all here!

     Mister Black seems startled by the book, then pretends it's
     nothing.

                         MISTER BLACK
               A book of delusions.  Anything else?

                         WHITE
               But I...

                         MISTER BLACK
               I see.
                    (turns to the
                    victims)
               The verdict, yes...

                         WHITE
               Wait, this isn't fair...

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN stands again.  This time she opens her
     mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then:

                         DISEMBOWELED WOMAN (whisper)
               Guil  -  ty...

     White is agitated, fear in his face.  Mister Black stamps SOME
     PAPERS before him repeatedly.

     ON THE PAPERS  -  official-looking documents.  The stamp says:
     GUILTY.

     CLOSE on White's eyes.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Before I pronounce sentence...

     Suddenly the papers on the bench in front of Mister Black BURST
     INTO FLAMES.  Mister Black recoils, almost falling off his
     chair, taken by surprise.  The Mystery Men all look at White, a
     murmur of concern.

     Mister Black looks up at White  -  angered.

                         MISTER BLACK
               How dare you use your tricks on me!

     White, genuinely surprised, looks around.  Several Mystery Men
     BACK AWAY from him, scared.

                         WHITE
               I didn't realise...

                         MISTER BLACK
               Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are
               insignificant.

     He glares across the room, angrily.  An WOODEN CHAIR in a corner
     starts to vibrate.

     CLOSE on Mister Black's eyes.

     The chair rises into the air  -  HURLS across the room at White.

     Mister Black laughs as it crashes into the wall.  White ducks
     just in time.

     The gathered Mystery Men erupt into enthusiastic applause.

     White regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his
     own.  He lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin  -
     a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several
     plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the
     spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near
     Mister Black, making him dance back and forth comically.

     This display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a WALTZ
     playing on a floating gramophone White has also activated with
     his mind.

     SEVERAL Mystery Men are TERRIFIED.  White is amazed at his own
     performance.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You'll regret that.

     Mister Black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his
     mouth.

                         MISTER BLACK (shouts)
               SHUT IT DOWN!

     A Mystery Man by the window, picks up a phone and dials
     furiously.  Everyone in the room remains silent  -  waiting.

                         MAN ON PHONE
               Yes, we have a problem here.  Shut it
               down immediately.

     White doesn't understand what is going on.  O.S. the SOUND of
     machinery WINDING DOWN.

     ANGLE ON a clock hanging on the wall.  ON the SECOND HAND.  It
     suddenly STOPS.

     All eyes are on Mister Black.

                         MISTER BLACK
               This has all gone too far.  Yes, much
               too far.

     Mister Black starts to SHAKE.  His eyes shut, clenches his
     teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to
     the floor.

     Around the room WALLS CRACK, plaster rains down from the
     ceiling...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT.  CITY  -  NIGHT

     All over the city things START TO FALL APART  -  a devastating
     impact on the landscape.

     MONTAGE

     A street CRACKS OPEN.  Beneath the pavement are pulsating
     intestine-like organs.  These burst open with pus...

     A building vanishes...

     A car on a street corner flies into the air...

     A telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging
     itself into the concrete.  Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the
     hole left behind...

     Geysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky...

     BLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone
     steps...

     THE CITY is coming apart...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     INT.  APARTMENT H'

     The room looks like an earthquake hit it  -  broken furniture and
     gaping holes torn in the walls.

     Several MYSTERY MEN huddle behind an upturned table, watching
     WHITE and MISTER BLACK.  They face each other, both still
     standing  - mental energies focused against each other in battle.

     The fighting is taken its toll on both men.

     A DAGGER hangs suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating to face
     White with its shining silver blade.

     Mister Black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony
     fists by his side.  Pushing every ounce of mental power at the
     knife.

     White, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind
     against the knife.

     The blade STARTS TO MOVE, ever so slowly at first, towards
     White.  His body is shaking with his mental effort.  A bead of
     sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his
     vision.

     He is losing.


     INT.  KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     We see an OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE.  A group of dark figures.  WHITE
     regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table.  From his
     perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he
     removes a syringe from White's FOREHEAD.

                         FIGURE
               Good as new.  Yes.  Everything is
               easier now.

     His vision CLEARS, he can see.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Behind him a
     SMALL CROWD who turn out to be MYSTERY MEN.

     Mister Black suddenly pulls at his own face, removes the mask.

     Underneath is a mess of PULSATING ORGANS AND INSECT PARTS.
     This is what Mystery Men really look like.  He laughs, starts to
     MOVE rhythmically  -  a strange dance-step.  The others join in,
     as they too pull off masks.

     Each Man reaches up to his left ear in unison.  They pull
     squirming INSECTS out, hold them up to the light.  The insects
     scream triumphantly.

     White screams too.  And he can't stop.

     Everything goes BLACK.  Then the sound of a key rattling in a
     lock.  A door slowly creaks open...


     INT.  SEASIDE HOTEL ROOM  -  DAY

     A P.O.V. enters a small room.

     Dappled SUNLIGHT through a tattered lace curtain. A clock ticks
     on a wall.  A cough O.S. from the corridor.  A FAT MAN, talks as
     he enters:

                         FAT MAN
               It's small but clean...
                    (it isn't)
               ...and the view's nice.
                    (points to window)
               Isn't it?

     JOHN WHITE enters.  He is haggard, eyes rimmed with red.  He
     still holds the small black NOTEBOOK, tight to his chest.  He
     stands in the centre of the room, looks up.  Strangely, though
     the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories  -
     windows sit at various heights.

     White walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands.

     OUTSIDE

     A narrow street and at the end, the ocean.  The sound of distant
     surf, he can taste the salt spray.

                         WHITE (without turning)
               I'll take it.

     The man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go,
     shutting the door.  White puts the notebook down on a table near
     the open window.

     LATER

     White has fallen asleep on the bed.

     He wakes, troubled.  Stands and walks over to the sink next to
     the bed.  He moves like he is underwater.  The sea-breeze tugs at
     the curtain, draws him to the window.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings.
     TWO FIGURES  approach each other.

     He pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the
     woman, places it against the pillow on the bed.  He sits on the
     edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs
     nothing out of the ordinary.

     White is disturbed by a TINY MOVEMENT in his coat pocket.  He
     reaches in and pulls out a small, EMACIATED FISH.

     Disgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the
     creature.  White raise his foot.  His heel comes down with a
     sickening SQUISH.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY towards the notebook near the
     window.  As the SHOT TIGHTENS we can read the title on the
     cover:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     Now a sudden GUST OF WIND blows open the book.  The pages
     flicker past.  Glimpses of happy things.  A child's drawings of
     smiling people.  The sun shining down on a blue ocean full of
     sailing boats.  Fields of colourful flowers.  Cute animals.


     INT.  LONG CORRIDOR  -  DAY

     SOUND OF SURF, distant, muffled.

     CAMERA MOVES slowly towards a door.  The final door  -  no
     others beyond this.  ECHOIC FOOTSTEPS.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  His haggard face moves through darkness.  He
     looks down at his walking feet.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  White sees water, waves breaking, through the
     cracks in the floorboards of the hallway.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white-hot,
     by the SUN outside.

     ON HIS HAND  -  As he reaches towards the handle.

     ON HIS FACE  -  As the door opens.  A sharp line of light cuts
     across his features, as his eyes blink and water.  The wind
     pulls at his messy hair.  SURF NOISE is louder now.

     REVERSE ANGLE  -  WIDER  -  OUTSIDE looking through the door,
     along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape.  At
     the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of A WOMAN WITH RED
     HAIR.  She looks out at the ocean, her back turned.

     ANGLE LOOKS BACK at White standing in the open doorway, squints
     into the sun.  Suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the
     first time.  He steps OUT OF FRAME briskly  -  a weight gone
     from his shoulders.  Everything is clear finally, he knows
     exactly what to do.

     A voice recites names over a P.A. system.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     A TRACKING SHOT follows White, moves down the pier toward the
     woman.  As White steps up to her, she turns and smiles.

                         WOMAN  (indicates the sea)
               Beautiful.

     White nods slowly.  He looks out of place in his crumpled suit.
     He stares out at the ocean.  Seagulls fly over.  Sun reflects
     off waves.

                         WHITE
               Yes...

                         WOMAN
               What's your name?

     He looks at her.  Smiles.  Then, slowly, brings his hands to her
     throat.

                         WHITE
               John...  White.

                             Alex Proyas







                            REVISED DRAFT
                         November 29th, 1992





     DARKNESS

     A LOW RUMBLE increases in volume.


     FADE UP:

     A BLACK-GLOVED HAND wraps around a bulky electrical lever,
     thrusts FORWARD.

     SNAP!  -  Electricity arcs through darkness.

     O.S. sound of MACHINERY turning ON.

     TITLES OVER

     MONTAGE OF CLOCKS starting  -  various.  Second hands turn  -
     TICKING gets louder.


     INT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT

     SHADOWS DANCE.  A bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing:
     clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor...

     SLEEPING EYES in and out of darkness.  The eyes open.
     Confusion.

     WIDEN ANGLE ON JONATHAN WHITE  -  a man in his early thirties,
     dark featured.

     He sits up.  Water splashes.  He's in a tub of long cold water.
     His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever.

     He looks down into the murky water around him.  A feint
     movement beneath the surface, something swimming  -  A SMALL
     DARK SHAPE.  Startled, he leaps from the bath.

     ANGLE  -  THE SWINGING LIGHT BULB.  The man's hand reaches up,
     stops the light-bulb mid swing.

     He steps to a circular window.  The glass is cracked, covered
     in grime.  He wipes it, this only smears the dirt.

     It's dark out there.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  from outside the window, through blurry
     glass.

     A RAPID FLYING P.O.V. PULLS BACK in silence.  The window is a
     SPECK on the side of a vast grey tower.

     BACK IN THE BATHROOM

     White shivers, cold.  He stares down at the puddle he drips on
     the floor.  He looks at his feet and legs, covered with
     numerous SMALL BITES.  He dries the bloody wounds with a towel.

     He picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on.
     Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with
     HOLES in both soles.  In his trouser pocket he finds a key  -
     a room number on a plastic tag.

     He hears splashing in the bath-tub.  He steps over, looks into
     the murky water.  Suddenly a SMALL SILVER FISH leaps from the
     water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about.

     He leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the
     water.

     Like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the
     shadows.  He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand
     inches from the doorknob.  He leans down.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYE

     Blinking through the key-hole.

     P.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM  -  A glimpse of motion  -  the door
     across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM  -  NIGHT

     WHITE pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room.

     No sign of life.  Cheap decorations.  He walks around
     cautiously.  Turns lights on.  Then reconsiders.  Turns them off
     again.  Disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror.

     ANGLE ON OPEN BATHROOM DOOR  -  the fish has jumped from the tub
     again and is flapping on the floor.

     White steps back into the bathroom.  He picks up the fish again,
     doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket.

     BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM

     He searches through things.  A grey overcoat in the closet.  He
     goes through the pockets, finds a WALLET.  No I.D., just a
     laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea-side town.

     ANGLE ON A REVOLVER on the bed-side table.  He picks it up, his
     grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the
     trigger and...

     BANG!

     The gun goes off.  A BULLET RICOCHETS wildly around the room,
     bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself
     in the wall.

     Startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off
     again.  He examines it carefully now.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Five bullets left.

     He turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the
     inside pocket of the coat.

     He moves to the bed.  A RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH on the rug.  A
     fragment of a woman's face, her left eye.  He lifts the
     fragment up.  There's handwriting on the back, part of a note:

               ...MEANS THE MOST TO ME.  LOVE YOU
               FOREVER.  -  E...

     The rest is missing.

     He sits on the edge of the bed.  As he does this, he notices
     something else on the floor.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  follows a dark stain on the floorboards, to a
     woman's bare foot behind the bed.  He stands abruptly, fumbles
     across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room.

     In the shadows he can make out a woman's naked BODY lying in a
     pool of blood.  Her eyes stare lifeless.

     White stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his
     mouth.


     INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White stumbles from the room, leans against a wall for support.

     Lights flicker.

     At the end of the corridor, elevator doors open.  Light and
     musak flood out.


     INT.  LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     White staggers from the elevator, moves past a deserted front
     desk.  A VOICE from the back room:

                         HOTEL MANAGER O.S.
               Hey, you! You gotta message.

     White stops, looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain.

                         WHITE
               What?

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Message in d'box!  You deaf?

     White sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him.
     Reaching across the desk, he glances through the bead curtain
     into the manager's office.  TELEVISION SOUNDS O.S.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Hard to see  -  the man sits in the chair, lit by the glow of
     the T.V. set.  White grabs the note, looks at it.  A PHONE
     NUMBER, also his room number, and what appears to be his name:
     JONATHAN WHITE.  That's all.  White thrusts the message in his
     pocket.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Got my money?

                         WHITE
               What?  I...  How long have I been
               here?

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Jeez, too damn long if you ask me!
               What about the two weeks y'owe me...

     Totally confused, White turns to leave, sees something.  Stops.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A painting on a wall (cheap print variety)  -
     waves on a beach.  A breeze rustles the pages of a calender,
     pinned beside the picture.
   
     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  MOVE IN on his ear.  O.S. SOUND  -  surf
     crashes on shore.  A WOMAN'S VOICE WHISPERS:

                         VOICE O.S.
               What is your name...  What is your
               name...

     He backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic
     -  sees a sign:  TOILETS.  A painted hand points the way.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Hey!

                         WHITE (without turning)
               I'll be back later.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Yeah.  Well, y'better be.
          
     CAMERA REVEALS A FIGURE  -  watching from a shadowy corner of
     the lobby.

     As White runs out, the MYSTERY MAN picks up a pay-phone, dials.
     Whispers into the receiver in a foreign language.


     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White pushes shakily through a red door, runs down a corridor.
     Pipes steam and drip water.  He rounds a corner, slips, nearly
     falls.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM  -  NIGHT

     Puddles on the floor, stains on the walls.

     White bursts through the door and into a cubicle.  He bends
     over a toilet bowl and VOMITS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     He looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve.  A breeze tugs at
     his stringy hair.  A tiny ventilation grill above the cistern
     looks out at the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  OUTSIDE

     Sheets of newspaper blow past.  A full moon, surrounded by
     blood red clouds, hangs above empty streets.


     INT.  CINEMA  -  NIGHT

     A WATCH  -  on a hairy wrist.  Seconds tick past.  Soft
     flickering light.  VOICES O.S.

     ANGLE ON FRANK BUMSTEAD  -  police inspector.  He looks down at
     the watch.  Time to leave.  He STANDS, heads for an illuminated
     exit sign.

     Images flicker on a SCREEN.  The inspector rushes to the door,
     runs into an USHER, who gasps.

                         BUMSTEAD (to usher)
               Gesundheit!

     Bumstead quickly moves off.


     INT.  CINEMA LOBBY

     The INSPECTOR makes a call, licks the tip of a pencil,
     scribbles in a notebook.  Behind thick glass, he argues
     soundlessly into a phone.

     BIG IN FOREGROUND  -  a popcorn machine rattles noisily.

     INSIDE THE BOOTH

     The inspector is upset, face strained.  A MALE VOICE chatters
     quickly through the receiver.

                         BUMSTEAD (cuts in)
               ...but you told me the meeting was
               ten-thirty.

     A burst of chatter.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I know, sir, but I can't make it at
               nine-thirty...  It's  -  um  -  well,
               inconvenient...

     A stream of chatter stops him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir...  I understand...  Yes...
               But, I've done fine so far without an
               assistant...

     The inspector tries to interject as the VOICE cuts in again...

                         BUMSTEAD
               But...  But I...  I...
                    (defeated)
               Nine-thirty.  Yes.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM

     We are underwater.  WHITE's FACE swims into view.  Bubbles spew
     from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror.

     ANGLE ON MEN'S ROOM

     White washes his face in a sink.  He looks up, wipes his face
     dry with his coat.  He turns towards the door to leave.

     There are TWO  -  identical.  He cannot remember which he came
     through.  Takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness.

     He realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but
     the door CLICKS behind him:  locked.


     INT.  CONCRETE TUNNEL

     Pitch black.  Trickling water.  A distant voice over a P.A.
     system recites names, followed by numbers.  A LIGHT, far away.
     White walks towards it.

     He steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a
     blank wall.  He pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the
     slot, dials the number on his message.  Ringing  -  no answer.

     Suddenly White feels cold.

                         VOICE O.S.
               There you are.

     Startled, White drops the phone and turns.  A figure moves
     forward out of darkness:

     ANGLE ON THE MYSTERY MAN from the hotel lobby.  The stranger
     wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale
     skin.  He is completely bald.  He studies White carefully.

     White glances about nervously  -  walks back up the corridor,
     his eyes pinned to the man.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You are lost, yes?

     White retreats faster.

     A FLASH OF STEEL  -  a dagger appears by the stranger's side,
     gripped in a black leather glove.  He moves forward, a grin on
     his pale face.

     White stops, backs against the wall.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               Co-operate.  Do not make this
               difficult.

     White panics  -  he's cornered.  He remembers the revolver.  He
     pulls it from his coat and LEVELS it at the stranger, his hand
     shakes terribly.

     ON THE STRANGER continuing to advance.  Something about his
     eyes makes White immobile, unable to think clearly.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You will not shoot, yes.  There is a
               place in your mind, a corner of
               darkness...

     THE GUN FIRES again and again.  Red splashes appear on the man.
     His shoulder.  His leg.  His neck.  He walks forward, with
     spastic jerks as bullets RIP into him.

     A final shot POINT BLANK into the stranger's forehead.  A
     stream of black liquid spouts from the hole.

     Blue smoke clears.  The man stands motionless, his mouth hangs
     open.  Then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground.


     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     CLICKING of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles.
     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD strides down a silent corridor.  He reaches
     into his pocket, removes a SURGICAL MASK, places it over his
     nose and mouth.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at
     the end of the corridor.  The man, who is dressed identically
     to the inspector, is his superior:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good evening, sir.

                         STROMBOLI
               Yes.  This way.

     STROMBOLI leads the inspector into a tiled room containing
     several COVERED BODIES.  The two men are greeted by a cheerful-
     looking MORTICIAN.

                         MORTICIAN
               Welcome, gentlemen.  Youíre early.
               Here for the examination, right?

     Stromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the
     row of corpses.  Bumstead follows.

                         STROMBOLI
               The handiwork of an extremely sick
               individual.

     He throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations.

                         STROMBOLI
               Youíve read the reports.  Not much to
               go on.  We know nothing about him,
               except that he likes to cut them...
               Always the same type of blade.
               Forensics match in each case...
               Anyway, it's all in the reports, read
               them for yourself.

     STROMBOLI shakes his head, turns away from the final body,
     looks at the inspector.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why are you wearing that thing on
               your face?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Germs, sir.  These places are full of
               them.

                         STROMBOLI
               I see.
                    (continues)
               One thingís for sure, heís ambitious.
               Youíll be a busy man from now on.

                         MORTICIAN
               You can say that again.

     Stromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man.  The Mortician
     becomes serious and goes back to his work.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít
               this his case?

                         STROMBOLI
               Thompson suffered a kind of severe
               delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway
               he isnít with us any longer.  The
               case is yours.  Go through his files.
               Take what you need.
                    (less business-like)
               By the way, howís your mother?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...

                         STROMBOLI (cuts in)
               Very good...

     The chief-inspector turns, paces to the door briskly.

                         STROMBOLI
               Letís go, Bumstead.  So much to do
               and so little time.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     A large faded BILLBOARD advertisement on a building facade.  A
     portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "LUMP-
     O"  -  a cereal box carton.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY, rises upwards, CLOSER on the
     womanís face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her
     PAINTED IRIS.


     INT.  STAIR-WELL

     A raftered room on the other side of the billboard.  CAMERA
     TILTS TO a convoluted staircase  -  at the base, the SHADOW OF
     A MAN runs.

     FEET pace rapidly.  TILT UP TO REVEAL  -  WHITE.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS as he tries to lose himself from possible
     pursuers.  He steps through a low archway into a back alley,
     rounds a corner.

     A DEAD-END.  White stops, looks around, then up.  Heís breathing
     heavily, trying to catch his breath.  He starts to shake.

     ABOVE, the walls stretch into darkness.  An OPENING way up
     there  -  he can see stars.  Something dark crosses the gap of
     sky.  A RUSHING NOISE in the distance.  Wind starts to pick up.

     Trash is being kicked up.  A sheet of NEWSPAPER wraps around
     Whiteís leg.  He tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonít
     come off.  He bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but
     something grabs his eye.

     He stares at the page for a moment  -  then his LEGS SLIP from
     under him and he falls to the ground.  He holds his head like
     itís going to explode.  A whimper deep in his throat.  His body
     is trembling violently.

     PUSH IN TIGHT on the paper on the ground.  A front-page
     headline:  MAN-HUNT CONTINUES FOR SERIAL KILLER!

     White looks up  -  terrified.  The RUSHING NOISE O.S. again.

     HIS P.O.V.

     ON THE WALL facing him, a DOOR has appeared where moments
     before there was nothing.  The door creaks open to reveal
     ANOTHER DOOR WITHIN.  This one extends outwards on the end of a
     lengthening wooden shaft.

     White, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket.
     Tries to side-step the ADVANCING DOOR but itís too late, he can
     only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the
     wall.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     HAND-HELD P.O.V. THROUGH the swaying beads hanging in the back-
     room doorway.  TWO FIGURES peer into the room.

                         FIGURE 1
               We are looking for Jonathan White.

     THE HOTEL MANAGER looks up, moves forward into light:  a squat,
     hunch-backed man with glasses.  He steps through the beads,
     glares at the intruders.

                         MANAGER
               What for?

     ON THE MEN  -  an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to
     kill White.  Black coats, glasses, pale skin.  Creepy.

     A BLACK GLOVED HAND flashes forward, grips the managerís face
     and doesnít let go.  The manager struggles, gulps for air.
     Heís pushed back heavily against the wall.

                         MAN 1
               Which room is he in?

     The leather glove SQUEEZES, blood trickles from the managerís
     ears, through the fingers.


     INT.  ROOM 43

     ANOTHER (VERY SHORT) FIGURE is searching the room.  He hears
     NOISES O.S. in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against
     the wall.

     ON THE MAN  -  FREDRICK  -  a stunted body, an oversized head,
     thick limbs.  The rest of his features lost in shadow.

     The door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room.

     ON THE TWO MYSTERY MEN as they step in and look around.  They
     search the room, knock stuff over.  One of the men kicks at the
     womanís corpse in the corner.  Behind him, Fredrick, still
     hiding near the door, slips into the corridor unnoticed.


     EXT.  FLYING P.O.V.  -  NIGHT

     A FLYING PERSPECTIVE past buildings.  An INSECT-LIKE BUZZING
     O.S.  Way down BELOW, in a canyon of silent buildings, a LONE
     FIGURE walks.


     EXT.  DOWN ON THE STREET

     A breeze pulls at WHITEís hair and coat.  He takes out the
     wallet  -  a few dollars.

     HIS P.O.V. AS HE WALKS

     The city is DEAD.  Empty.  Desolate.  Buildings hang down out
     of black.  Day-time was never invented.

     As he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a BUSINESS CARD he
     hadnít noticed, flutters to the ground.  He stops, picks it up.
     In simple print:  DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D., a phone number.
     Scribbled handwriting on the back says:  Thursday 0930.

     ON WHITE  -  he glances across the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A cafe.  A broken NEON FISH buzzes above the
     doorway.


     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     He walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six
     tables.  Empty.  Dirty.  He sits and waits.

     A CLOCK ticks on the wall  -  midnight.  White coughs, for
     attention.

     A NOISE from a doorway.  A SHADOW moves towards him, dragging
     one foot as it walks.  A SMALL ASIAN WOMAN appears and limps to
     his table.  She speaks very quickly IN CHINESE.  He does not
     understand.

     She points to a chalk board on the wall  -  a list of dishes
     also in Chinese, only one in English  -  the last one.  At the
     bottom.  In small print.  "NOODLES".

                         WHITE (nods)
               The noodles.  Iíll have some noodles.

     The old woman rips a YELLOW TICKET from a pad, gives it to
     White.  A number on it.  She points her crooked finger again
     at a SPEAKER BOX above a small serving window in the wall.  A
     greenish fluoro pulses from the room within.

                         WOMAN
               We call.

     She leaves again.

     White looks about the empty room.  Insects are zapped on an
     illuminated DEVICE hanging on the wall.  An old air-conditioner
     RATTLES noisily.

     NOISES from the kitchen  -  voices argue in Chinese, a baby
     cries.  Then SILENCE.

     White removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the
     table.

     He overcomes his fear, starts to read the article.  Leans
     forward, hands trembling.  Without realising, he holds the
     paper OVER A CANDLE burning on the table.  The paper CATCHES
     FIRE, is engulfed.  He drops the flaming page on the table.  Now
     the table-cloth starts to burn.

     White is frantic.  On a nearby table he finds a pitcher of
     water, and dumps this on the flames.  It kills the fire but
     leaves a black hole in the table-cloth.  The paper is ash.

     He moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the
     smoke away.


     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD is moving quickly.  He suddenly trips and falls to the
     floor.  He curses under his breath, then looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A door  -  THOMPSON:  DETECTIVE/INSPECTOR on the frosted glass.
     Bumstead stands, pushes into the office.

     INSIDE
 
     A total mess  -  paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee
     cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags.  Bumstead shakes his
     head.

                         BUMSTEAD
               A real shame...

     He starts to look around.

     TIGHT ON FILING CABINET  -  a drawer is pulled open.
     Thompsonís files are also a mess.  Bumstead continues to shake
     his head.  He reaches for a file.  A loud SNAP!

                         BUMSTEAD (screams)
               YAAAAAAAAAH!

     He recoils.  A mousetrap has snapped over his fingers.  He
     pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing.


     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     White is still waiting for his food.

     He leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg
     to examine the bites  -  worse, inflamed.  He uses a napkin to
     wipe at the pus.

     AERIAL PERSPECTIVE OF A FLY  -  circling the room, looking down
     on White.

     ON THE FLY  -  It lands on a plate of half eaten food on
     another table.  The creature is some kind of SURVEILLANCE
     DEVICE  -  half insect/half machine.  Itís spying on him.  MOVE
     IN TIGHT as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head.  It shits
     on the food behind it.

     White is oblivious to this.  Heís finished examining his leg,
     is sitting quietly.  He yawns.  His head nods forward briefly.

     A NOISE.  White looks up.

     A TRAP-DOOR has opened in the ceiling.  Two feet in black
     leather shoes descend from the hole.  A sea breeze blows
     through the room.  The SOUND OF SURF, SEAGULLS CRYING.

     ON Whiteís nose twitching.  He can smell the ocean.

     The WALLPAPER COMES ALIVE  -  like a seething tangle of worms.

     One by one, THREE MEN in black coats lower into the room,
     floating on air.  They pull out knifes, step forward.

     ON WHITE rigid with terror.

     ON THE MEN  -  though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the
     gloom, they too resemble the MAN who confronted White earlier.
     They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads.
     Ready to attack.  They lean over him, pause dramatically.

                         MAN 1
               Donít fall asleep.
                    (chuckles softly)
               Might never wake, yes.

     This Man turns to the others.  They all smile, then turn back
     to White.

                         MEN (in unison)
               Fifty-six.

     ANOTHER VOICE has been speaking softly  -  now it is louder.
     Repeating:

                         VOICE
               Fifty-six...  Fifty-six...

     ANGLE  -  a chair falls to the floor.

     White leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented.  Just a
     DREAM  -  he had dozed.

     WIDEN ANGLE  -  The place is still empty.  White glances to the
     serving window.  A DISH waits for him, framed in the glowing
     fluoro square.  He gets it.  A bowl of soupy liquid with
     noodles.  He sits down.

     He is about to start eating  -  realizes he has a fork instead
     of a spoon.  Picking up the bowl again, he heads to the
     kitchen.


     INT.  CORRIDOR

     He takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds
     himself in another corridor.  He looks about, unsure which
     direction to go in.


     INT.  SERIES OF ROOMS  -  LATER

     White is lost, still holding the soup.

     He moves through a number of RUSTED METAL DOORS that open and
     shut automatically.  Each reveals another room or corridor.
     Deserted spaces long forgotten  -  dusty, crumbling.

     He feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and
     looks at it.

     White holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup
     in the other.  Disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl.


     INT.  CORRIDOR

     A TICKING SOUND O.S.

     White stops.  Looks up.  A large clock suspended from the
     rafters.  A tug at his coat.

     Standing beside him is FREDRICK  -  the little man from Whiteís
     hotel room.

                         FREDRICK (stutters)
               Where have you been?  The doctorís
               been worried about you.

                         WHITE
               What?  Who are you?

     Fredrick looks nervously down the corridor.

                         FREDRICK
               Címon, letís go!  We donít have any
               time.

     The little man grabs Whiteís sleeve, starts to pull him along.

                         WHITE
               Hold it a minute.  Letís start at the
               beginning, huh?

     ANGLE ON  -  the top of a set of stairs in front of them.  Two
     dark figures appear.

     Fredrick looks up at them in horror.

                         FRERICK
               Shit!
                    (looks at White)
               Quick!  Run!

     Both men run like crazy, White awkwardly holding the bowl of
     soup.  They come to a junction, each takes a separate corridor.
     Fredrick finds some stairs, climbs two at a time.

     White climbs INTO FRAME, looks around, finds another corridor.
     The little man is nowhere to be seen.  White reaches another
     junction  -  several corridors branch off.             

     HIS P.O.V. PANNING AROUND                   

     Each passageway completely deserted.        

                         WHITE
               Shit.                                       

     He keeps running.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

     A PHOTO FLASH  -  illuminates the dead body of the hotel manager,
     slumped in his own blood.

     Bumstead leans INTO FRAME, examines the corpse.  He notices
     several stab wounds in the manís abdomen.  Various cops search
     the room.

     One cop walks up to the Inspector.

                         COP
               We got another one upstairs

                         BUMSTEAD (deadpan)
               Great.


     INT.  ROOM  -  NIGHT

     A SMALL ROOM with arched windows that look over the city.
     Fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned
     table.

     He scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then
     puts it into a METAL CYLINDER he finds beneath the table also.

     He glances out a window, notices A FIGURE standing beneath a
     street-lamp below, looking up at him.  Startled, Fredrick darts
     back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen
     vertical PIPES running up into the ceiling.

     TIGHT ON ONE OF THE PIPES  -  he opens a small hatch and puts
     the metal cylinder in it.  The cylinder is snatched from his
     hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air.

     WIDER

     Fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief.  A shadow falls across
     his back.  He turns.  He screams.

     INT./EXT.  VARIOUS

     TIGHT  -  rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding
     speed.  The cylinder races around corners.  It clanks and
     grinds.  HURTLES up the side of a building.  THEN PLUMMETS
     underground.  Rushes through darkness.


     EXT.  BRIDGE  -  NIGHT

     THE CAMERA MOVES along a bridge-like structure.  An enclosed
     corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons.  Under the bridge,
     pipes spew sewage into stagnant water.

     ANGLE ON WHITE WALKING  -  seen through a series of illuminated,
     dirty, windows.  He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds
     before him.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of
     clattering metal.  A pipe runs the length of the corridor  -
     the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness.

     Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS
     somewhere in the building.  White hurriedly moves towards the
     source.

     ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE
     in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole
     in the wall and looks through.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room
     in a warm glow.

     White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the
     hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two
     dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of
     dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  itís Fredrick  -  just as
     both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He
     doesnít scream this time, just gags on blood running from his
     mouth.

     Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteís neck,
     traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free
     himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard
     floor, makes a mess.

     INSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing
     noise.

     BACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength.
     The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run
     away but glances at the floor.

     The fish is flapping about  -  still alive.


     EXT.  STREET

     White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the
     base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering
     above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance:
     LIBRARY.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop
     suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood
     blast away violently.

     BUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship.

     A HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled.

     ON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit!

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Sorry, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Donít ever sneak up on me like that!
               Who are you?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Patricia Crenshaw.

     She puts out her hand.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iím your new assistant.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I didnít requisition a secretary.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               The Chief-Inspector thought you might
               need a hand.

                         BUMSTEAD (uncertain)
               Oh.

     He takes her hand tentatively.  They shake.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iíve taken the liberty and had
               Inspector Thompsonís office searched,
               as I believe you instructed.  All
               clear now, sir.  They found several
               more traps and things were filed
               under pretty strange categories...
               Poor man.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               You wonít regret this, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Fine.

     Bumstead moves off.


     INT.  LIBRARY

     White steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign
     saying, SILENCE in formal letters.  The place seems abandoned,
     then he notices a hint of movement.  Cigarette smoke snakes
     into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor.

     He walks up to an elderly female LIBRARIAN sitting behind a
     desk, smoking, reading.  White looks somewhat distraught still.

                         WHITE
               Keep newspapers here, birth
               certificates, records of deaths, that
               kind of thing?

     The librarian looks up from her book.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Which would you like first?

                         WHITE
               Okay.  Newspapers.

     She takes her glasses off.  Her eyes are TINY, like pin-heads.
     She studies White.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Are you alright?

     He looks around  -  restrained panic.

                         WHITE (looks at the woman)
               Sure.  Iím fine.

                         LIBRARIAN (nods)
               Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the
               hall.  Third floor.  Turn left.
               Section C-7.  Row 35, near the
               toilets.

     She replaces her glasses, watches White rush away.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Donít mention it...

     She blows her nose into a handkerchief.  The snort ECHOES
     LOUDLY.


     INT.  LIBRARY CORRIDOR

     White rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues.  He
     finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with
     old volumes.  Comes to number 7.

     He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34
     but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc.

     No Row 35.

     He stops and looks around  -  sure enough a door displays a
     small sign:  TOILETS.

     White is sweating profusely.  He now sits on a chair, takes off
     his shoes, rubs his feet.  He pulls a book from a shelf behind
     him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out,
     folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes.

     He gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate
     diagram of the library interior.  An arrow points to a section
     near a wing labelled:  MAPS.  Near the arrow it says:  YOU ARE
     HERE.

     He keeps walking.

     He finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a
     sign is nailed to it:  WE ARE REMODELLING.  WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY
     INCONVENIENCE.

     White, annoyed now, tries to force his way in.  Puts his
     shoulder to the door, pushes several times.  It CRUMBLES under
     his weight  -  rotten.

     He finds himself in a DUSTY ROOM.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of
     old newspapers.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper
     off the shelf.  The instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust
     in his hands.  He picks up another, and another, each in turn
     breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES face each other across a polished black
     table.  They speak in a foreign language.  A phone rings.
     Figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively.

     Figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to
     lock together.  A complex puzzle.  He gets impatient with the
     puzzle, dashes it to the floor.

     Figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something.  Hands
     the note to Figure 2, who in turn drops it into A CHUTE.

     CONTROL ROOM

     The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 (in
     shadow yet again).  He reads from the note over a silver
     microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue.

     TIGHT ON A SPEAKER  -  his distorted voice.  A final mysterious
     person  -  Figure 4  -  listens to the announcement.  He takes
     a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a
     board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs.  The
     board resembles a planning table in a war-room.

     A HIGH ANGLE as the CAMERA PULL BACKS on the grouping of cut
     out figures.  More and more of them.  Ten.  Twenty.  A hundred.
     A sinister army.


     INT.  INTERSECTING STREET  -  NIGHT

     White is in a phone booth.  He removes the note from his
     pocket, dials.  No answer again.  He dials the OPERATOR.  A
     muffled voice over the line.

                         WHITE
               Iím trying to reach nine zero eight
               triple two.  I canít get through...
                    (beat)
               What?!...
                    (angry)
               Shit!

     He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a coin, puts it into the
     slot.  Heís sweating again.  He wipes his brow with a trembling
     hand.

                         WHITE
               It is?...  Which area is that number
               listed in?...  Is that near the
               ocean?...  The ocean...  Never mind.
               Have a Jonathan White listed?...
               WHITE.  Seventeen?  All Johns?  I
               see...  Never mind.

     He hangs up, then removes the business card he found in his
     wallet.  He is about to dial but decides otherwise.  He steps
     into the street.

     A HIGH ANGLE

     White walks between tall buildings, towards a narrow street
     that branches off into two separate routes.  He stops.  He
     canít decide which branch to take  -  he steps to the left,
     then steps back, takes a few steps to the right, reconsiders
     again...


     INT.  POLICE STATION/BUMSTEADíS OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     TRACK ALONG  -  piles of towering files bursting at the seams
     with paperwork  -  TO FIND Bumstead hunched over notes,
     photographs and files.  His eyes are rimmed with red.  He
     doesnít seem to be getting anywhere.

                         CRENSHAW O.S.
               Coffee?

     He looks up.  The secretary stands in the doorway with another
     big pile of paperwork.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?  I donít drink coffee.  A cup
               of tea would be good.  Milk and no
               sugar.

     Crenshaw puts the paperwork down on Bumsteadís already
     overcrowded desk.

                         CRENSHAW
               Making progress?

     He looks at her like she just slapped him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               These are the investigations of a
               madman.  He has fabricated an entire
               bizarre paranoid delusion with no
               internal logic whatever.
                    (without looking up)
               This is a mess.  A horrible mess.
                    (looks at her now)
               Itís the second time now.

     Miss Crenshaw looks concerned.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Look at this!

     He holds up a sheet of white paper  -  a report.  The woman
     steps over and looks at it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You typed this report?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Wrong?  Look at this!

     The woman bends down, adjusts her glasses, examines it.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               It seems fine.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Fine?  Look here!

     His finger points at the bottom of the page  -  a tiny,
     INSIGNIFICANT ink smudge.

                         BUMSTEAD
               How can I submit this?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iím sorry...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Do you wash your hands before you
               type things?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Why, yes.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Well be more careful, please.

     An embarrassed beat, then:

     RI-I-I-ING!

     Bumstead reaches for the phone but Crenshaw is on it first.

                         CRENSHAW
               Inspector Bumsteadís office...
               Yes...  Yes...

     She cups the receiver with her hand, looks at Bumstead.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  The Chief-Inspector said
               he would see you now.


     INT.  POLICE STATION HALL-WAY

     TRACKING SHOT towards a door:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR on the frosted
     glass.  A hand reaches INTO FRAME, knocks twice.

                         STROMBOLI O.S.
               Enter!

     INSIDE

     Bumstead steps into the office  -  finds STROMBOLI wandering
     about the room, distracted, searching for something...

                         STROMBOLI
               What is it?

     He pulls the waste-basket up and empties the contents onto his
     desk, sorts through it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               A formality.  I need to speak with
               Thompson.  Officially I need your
               written permission.

     Stromboli is looking through his desk drawers now.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why do you want to speak to him?

                         BUMSTEAD
               A hunch.  He might be able to...

                         STROMBOLI (from under desk)
               Bumstead, donít be so paranoid.
               Leave him alone  -  heís a sad case.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Itís extremely important to my
               investigation...

                         STROMBOLI
               Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything
               else?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Actually, I was wondering, sir, if
               you could let me have a few uniforms,
               to follow up for me...

                         STROMBOLI O.S. (pokes head above desk)
               Absolutely not.  Up to my ears in
               cases right now  -  canít spare
               anyone.

     Stromboli becomes distracted again  -  stands up, looks behind
     pictures hanging off the walls.  A big sign suspended above his
     desk says, SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LITTLE TIME  -  his motto.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Lost something?

                         STROMBOLI
               What makes you think that!  If you
               would learn to concentrate on facts,
               not get so side-tracked  -  you might
               get things done faster, Bumstead...

     The door clicks shut.  Stromboli looks up  -  the inspector has
     gone.


     EXT.  PLAZA  -  NIGHT

     White walks under stone archways.

     Across an empty plaza is a sign above a door:   DRUGS OPEN 24
     HOURS and in smaller print, recently added beneath:   SHAVE &
     HAIRCUT $5.00.


     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     White walks between bare, dusty shelves.  Only one shelf
     carries products  -  BOX AFTER BOX OF "LUMP-O".  He moves up to
     a small counter.  A man with thick glasses, dressed like a
     BARBER, is seated there.

                         WHITE
               I need something to keep me awake.

                         BARBER
               Looks like you need a haircut to me.

                         WHITE
               Thanks.  Just some pills.

                         BARBER
               Only two bucks.  Shave as well...

                         WHITE (annoyed now)
               Your sign says you sell drugs  -
               well, Iím here to buy some.  Okay?

                         BARBER
               Relax.  Sure!

     He waves dramatically to a shelf above his head, with several
     bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules.

                         BARBER
               Tell you what  -  let me cut yer
               hair, give ya watcha need half price.
               Canít argue at that!

                         WHITE (evenly)
               I donít want a haircut.

     LATER

     CAMERA TRACKS OFF a clock on a wall  -  REVEALS WHITE in a
     barber chair.  The BARBER gleefully works on WHITEís hair.  A
     thin OLD GUY in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain,
     smiles, playing a violin.  Heís passionate but bad.

                         BARBER (talks fast)
               Cut hair when I was in the navy,
               yíknow  -  havenít lost the touch.
               Bet youíre happy ëbout that.  Huh!

                         WHITE
               Sell maps?

                         BARBER
               What of?

                         WHITE
               The city.  I need to get to the
               ocean.

                         BARBER
               Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On
               vacation?

     White doesnít answer.  The old guy with the violin moves back
     and forth behind White, smiling as he plays.

                         BARBER
               Grandpa thought customers might like
               some mood music.

                         WHITE (unconvinced)
               Nice...

                         BARBER
               You still look familiar.  Itís
               driving me nuts!  Sure I donít know
               ya from somewhere?

                         WHITE (nervous now)
               Not me.

     Barber looks out the front window as his hands busily trim
     hair.

                         BARBER
               Mnunn.  Cold lately.
                    (lathers up Whiteís
                    face)
               That night, couple weeks ago.  That
               was real cold.  Remember that?

                         WHITE
               Not really...

                         BARBER
               Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says
               the wife.  But she sure canít
               complain.  Heh.  The erector set still
               works good.
                    (points to head)
               And this ainít no fucking rug!
               Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!

     Grandpa laughs and plays louder.

                         GRANDPA
               Yes! Feeeeel it!

     PUSH IN ON WHITE  -  he smiles weakly.


     INT.  DETAIL  -  NIGHT

     A HAND scrawls cryptic diagrams into a notebook.

     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     DOCTOR SCHREBER at his desk.  Heís bearded, with thick lensed
     glasses.  He puts the phone down, sits quietly at his desk,
     staring into space, lost in thought.

     A LOUD RATTLING NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  Schreber looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A rusted pipe runs across the ceiling and down one wall.  He
     steps across to the pipe on the wall, leans down, looks into an
     open hatch at its base.

     Without warning, out of the hatch pops the metal cylinder FROM
     SEVERAL SCENES PREVIOUS and bounces off the doctor's head.

     He curses, picks it up, opens it.  He plucks out the note and
     reads FREDRICKís SCRAWLED MESSAGE:

               DOCTOR, I DID AS YOU ASKED.  BUT
               THINK I MADE STUPID MISTAKE.  HOPE
               THINGS DONíT GET BACK TO YOU.  SORRY.
               -  FREDRICK.

     Schreber looks up  -  then PUNCHES HIS FIST into the desk
     angrily.


     INT.  EMPTY BUILDING

     A P.O.V. MOVES DOWN halls made of wood slatting  -  the floors,
     walls and ceilings are bare boards.  FOOTSTEPS O.S.

     TIGHT ON  -  a manís shadow as it descends a wooden staircase.

     REVEAL WHITE  -  He rummages in a paper bag as he walks.  Pulls
     out two capsules, swallows them.  Now he pulls out a pack of
     "LUMP-O", rips it open, eats ravenously.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps out into a street, turns a corner, drops the empty
     packet of cereal.  Now he sees TWO FIGURES APPROACH.  He hides
     behind a wall before he is seen.  Suddenly a deafening RINGING
     startles him.  He looks across a plaza.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A CHURCH.  A bell-tower, black against the sky.

     White stares up into the night.


     INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     White walks in, sits on A PEW, towards the back of the room,
     glances over his shoulder.  He tries to blend in with the SMALL
     GATHERING OF PEOPLE sitting silently around him.

     A PRIEST  -  appears at the altar, cloaked in a blood-red robe,
     followed by two altar boys also in red.  They move past a
     statue of an insect-like creature, walk in circles chanting
     softly, stop and stare at the congregation through eye-slits in
     their hoods.  The priest begins his sermon.

                         PRIEST
               Beware!  The night is deadly.  There
               is a criminal among us.

     White looks forward.

     TIGHT ON the priestís hand  -  It rises, points, moves over the
     heads of the congregation, accusingly.  Suddenly the red finger
     jabs towards an OLD WOMAN in the front row.

                         PRIEST
               It could be she!  The innocent across
               the street!

     All the congregation turn and stare at the woman.  Sheís
     terrified.

     The hand moves slowly now, across to a BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN
     several rows back.

                         PRIEST
               Or the temptress next door!

     The priest pauses dramatically then:

                         PRIEST
               Or mister nervy stranger at the back!

     Suddenly the finger is pointing at White. All the faces turn,
     stare suspiciously at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  frozen with fright.  Fortunately his face is
     obscured by shadow and the priest lowers his hand, continues
     the sermon.  The people look away.

                         PRIEST
               You are thinking it could be anyone?
               And youíre right!  Why, it could even
               be Mother!

     White goes to leave.  As he stands he notices the DOORS of the
     church open  -  two figures step in and move into the candle-
     light.

     MYSTERY MEN  -  Whiteís bizarre pursuers.  They look around.

     White ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the
     congregation.  He motions to them to keep quiet.  He runs into
     the legs of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN the priest pointed out.  She is
     startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles.

                         PRIEST (continues sermon)
               Evil stalks our streets.  It seeks to
               hide in our hearts.  Have you not
               evil within you now?

     White sees a nearby CONFESSION BOX.  Staying low, he runs,
     almost knocks over a large illuminated candle-holder, darts
     inside.  The girl watches him.

     A GAUNT-FACED WOMAN stands.  Hysterical.  She looks at the
     priest.

                         GAUNT WOMAN
               He took my little boy!  Iíll rip out
               his eyes!

     INSIDE  -  White breaths relief.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  carved on the dark stained wood in front of him
     is a crucified insect.  A voice surprises him.  Another PRIEST,
     OLDER.

                         OLDER PRIEST
               You have sinned?

                         WHITE
               NO.  Ah...

     White watches the two Mystery Men walk past, through the ornate
     wooden grill in front of his face.

                         PRIEST
               I am listening.

                         WHITE (lying)
               Thereís a...  woman.  I don't know
               but I think I, ahh...

                         PRIEST
               You fornicated?

     The Mystery Men look towards the box for a moment, towards
     White, but keep walking.

                         WHITE
               No.  I, ah...

                         PRIEST
               You seem restless.

     The Mystery Men seem to have gone.  White takes out the gun,
     keeping it hidden from the priest.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Only ONE BULLET left.

                         WHITE
               Someoneís after me.

                         PRIEST
               Then we must call the police.

                         WHITE
               No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.

     The silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward.

                         PRIEST
               I see.  Then who is after you?  What
               sins have you committed?

                         WHITE
               Just let me sit here for a moment?
               Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.

     The priest suddenly stares incredulously at White.  His eyes
     widen in horror.

                         PRIEST
               Youíre the murderer?
                    (starts to yell)
               Yes!  That must be it!  Donít kill
               me!

     White lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other
     over his mouth.  The old man stares at him, trembling
     uncontrollably.

                         WHITE
               Shut up!  Listen.  Walk out quietly.
                    (holds up gun)
               Understand?

     The priest nods stupidly.  White pushes him out of the
     confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his
     back.  Together they head for the doors.  Still no sign of the
     Mystery Men.

                         PRIEST
               Donít kill me!

                         WHITE
               Shut up!

                         PRIEST
               Please...

     White loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently.

                         WHITE (not so quietly)
               Iím not going to kill you, okay!

     Faces turn.

     The priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand.  While White
     is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away.

                         PRIEST (shouting/pointing)
               CRIMINAL!

     People start to scream and run.  The GAUNT WOMAN points at
     White.

                         GAUNT WOMAN (screams insanely)
               Itís him!  Rip out his eyes!

     Frightened, White holds the gun out.  Everyone panics,
     scatters.  People run for the exit.  Religious statues topple
     and smash.  The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor,
     trampled by the crowd.

     Amidst the chaos, the two MYSTERY MEN appear across the room,
     see White, head towards him.  He turns and runs.

     A STAIRCASE

     White climbs narrow stairs rapidly.


     INT.  BELL TOWER

     White stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street
     through a series of arched windows.  A low, raftered room,
     three huge black BELLS.

     Suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to
     swing, build momentum.

     CLANG!  CLA-A-A-ANG!  A cacophony of noise.

     White puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the
     stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Through the swinging bells  -  the MYSTERY MEN climb the last
     few steps on the other end of the dark room.  They advance
     slowly, clutching daggers.

     White raises his gun.  Aims.  Difficult to find his target  -
     the approaching MEN are obscured by the bells.

     White steps sideways, never taking his eyes off the Men.  They
     follow him slowly, pivoting about the bells in the centre of
     the tower, pursuers and pursued remaining a semi-circle apart.

                         WHITE (shouts)
               What do you want?  Tell me!

     The Men stop.  So does White.  They separate, now approaching
     him from OPPOSITE sides, moving around the bells.

     White doesnít know who to point the gun at  -  he swings back
     and forth, one to the other, faster and faster, as the Men
     approach.

     He lets them get uncomfortably close, then swings to his right,
     thrusts the gun to one Manís forehead.  FIRES.  The Man steps
     back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing,
     FALLS into the shaft at the centre of the tower.

     The second Man SWINGS his dagger at White.

     White falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily.  The Man
     advances, smiling  -  kicks the gun across the wooden floor.

     White, clutching at straws, lifts his foot, kicks down hard on
     a loose floorboard.  The board flies up, pivoting against
     Whiteís heel, catches the Mystery Man with a CRACK under the
     chin.

     White runs at the off-balance Man, head-butts him in the
     stomach.  The Man recoils, canít stop, steps off backwards into
     space, PLUMMETS INTO DARKNESS towards the street below.

     White relieved, turns, dusts himself, picks up his gun.  Looks
     down at the floor.  Broken glass and capsules everywhere  -  he
     dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle.  Starts to pick
     them up.

     Behind him SOMETHING is rising.

     The shadowy Mystery Man is LEVITATING HIMSELF back up to the
     bell-tower.  He lands behind White, approaches, lifting his
     dagger, closer and closer.

     White glances around.

     The Man lunges, pushing White towards the shaft beneath the
     swinging bells.  White FALLS, dangles over dark space, the Man
     stands above him.

                         MYSTERY MAN (shouts)
               Do not make us hurt you...

     The bells are swinging very close to the Man.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               It will be inconvenient, yes...

     Suddenly, to Whiteís amazement, the shiny black rim of a bell
     clips the Manís head.  SLAMS it against a low wooden beam in
     the ceiling.  A splash of black liquid.  The Man slumps to the
     ground, his head crushed beyond recognition.

     White pulls himself up  -  stands over the Manís body, trying
     to decide what to do.  A MOVEMENT catches his eye.

     TIGHT ON the collapsed Manís ear  -  something moves inside.  A
     BLACK INSECT, half-dead, crawls out of his crushed head.

     White revolted, SQUASHES the insect under his shoe.


     EXT./INT.  VARIOUS  -  MONTAGE

     RAPID MOVE ACROSS MYSTERY MEN screaming.  Faces contort with
     pain.  INTERCUT WITH:

     Electricity ARCING between electrodes.

     A building against the sky.  The windows EXPLODE.  Glass blows
     out, raining down on the street.

     A concrete wall SPLITS OPEN.  Slime oozes through the crack.

     An old man, walks on a deserted street, looks up at the sky.
     One of the lenses of his spectacles CRACKS without warning.
     A chair falls over in a dark room.

     A woman under a hair-dryer gossips on a phone.  Suddenly the
     phone emits a high-pitched shriek.  Her ear spouts blood and
     she screams.

     A small transistor radio emits a high frequency and short
     circuits with a spark.


     EXT.  BUILDING

     TIGHT ON  -  a wristwatch spinning backwards rapidly  -
     completely haywire.

     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD stands on a street corner staring blankly at
     his watch.  Taps it several times, annoyed, then looks up at a
     THREE STOREY BUILDING.  He holds a piece of paper in his other
     hand  -  on it a number rapidly scrawled:  23.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The dilapidated building  -  arched windows only on the topmost
     floor.  A faded number on the facade  -  also 23.  The windows
     light up continuously with rapid bursts of white light.

     INSIDE

     The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room.

     TWO FIGURES move about.  Bumstead glances at a UNIFORMED MAN,
     standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival.

     To the side, A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER flashes something swinging
     back and forth, hanging from the ceiling.  It looks like...
     Fredrick.  Dead.  His arms and legs missing.  A pool of blood
     beneath the mutilated torso.

     Bumstead looks at the cop.

                         BUMSTEAD
               How long have you been here?

                         COP
               Maybe ten minutes...
                    (looks at his watch)
               Thatís strange.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Spinning backwards?

     The cop is shaking his watch, tapping it with his finger.  He
     looks up.  Bumstead indicates his own watch.

                         COP
               Yours too?

     Bumstead nods.  He removes a notebook from his pocket, walks
     about the room, glances at objects, makes notes.

     Bumstead steps over to a small RECTANGULAR HOLE in the wall.
     He examines it carefully, then bends down and puts his head
     through.  On the other side is a corridor snaking off into
     darkness.  Just beneath the hole, is a broken dish and a
     puddle.  Lying half in the puddle is the business card of
     Doctor D.P. Schreber M.D.

     Without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby
     cop.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I want prints over here...

     Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteadís head in it.  He
     struggles.  The cop and the photographer run over to help.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     MOVE IN ON a doorway.  Above it a small illuminated red sign:

     DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D.

     REVERSE ANGLE ON WHITE

     He stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his
     wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesnít have
     anymore.


     INT.  WAITING ROOM

     A white room, bare.  Dirt stains the walls near the air-vents.
     A NURSE is typing behind her desk.

     A THUMPING fills the room.  The nurse stands, removes her shoe
     and hits a pipe running along the wall several times.  The
     noise stops.

     The front door creaks open and White enters.  She watches him
     step into the room.

                         WHITE
               I want to see the doctor.  It's
               important.

                         NURSE
               What time was your appointment?

                         WHITE (angry)
               Look!  Tell him I'm here.  Now.

     He's leaning across her desk threateningly.

                         NURSE (scared/standing)
               Yes, certainly...  Who should I say?

                         WHITE
               No idea.  Just get him...

     Suddenly a door opens and DOCTOR SCHREBER, clutching a file of
     papers, steps out.  He freezes, stares at White.  The papers
     fall from his hands to the floor.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     A group of DARK SILHOUETTES file into a concrete room.

     The MYSTERY MEN have gathered.  Like the Men who pursue White,
     they wear coats, leather gloves, dark glasses, and have near
     white skin.

     One MAN points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the
     peculiar foreign tongue.

     TIGHT ON THE DIAGRAM  -  a path through the city.  A circle
     marks the point where the red line ends  -  a cathedral.  The
     Man goes into broken English  -  a guttural accent.

                         MAN 1
               It has failed.

     ANOTHER MAN stands at the rear of the room.

                         MAN 2
               This is becoming dangerous, yes!

     YET ANOTHER MAN starts to tremble violently, seized with some
     kind of convulsion.  He froths at the mouth and throws his head
     about.  A TALLER MAN standing beside him opens a silver box,
     removes a small WRITHING WORM.  He places this on the tip of
     the trembling Man's tongue, who swallows it and calms down.

                         MAN 3
               Let's get this over with.

     ANOTHER MAN rises suddenly, pushes forcefully to the front of
     the group.

                         MAN 5
               What about the dance-steps!  This is
               my responsibility, we must resolve
               this issue, yes?

     THE MEN turn to face him.  He is out of line.  He becomes
     irritated, as if to say something further, then pulls himself
     short, sits down.

                         MAN 5
               Sorry.

                         MAN 3
               The situation has changed.
                    (pacing the room)
               This one is in possession of
               knowledge...

                         MAN 1 (cuts in)
               ...to avoid influence, yes.

                         MAN 4
               A freak!

                         MAN 1
               Impossible!

     RUMBLING NOISE O.S. attracts everyone's attention.  They all
     look to a round portal high on a wall.  The noise is louder.
     several figures on stilts run past outside the opening  -  then
     the noise subsides.  The MYSTERY MEN go back to more important
     things.

                         MAN 3
               It gets interesting, yes.

                         MAN 2
               Stop this!  It has gone too far!
               Tell Mister Black!

     Man 2 stares blankly into space, he makes a peculiar clicking
     noise with his mouth, his eyes roll upwards.


     INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE

     THE CAMERA GLIDES down a corridor, towards a door  -  a sign
     says, DOCTOR IS:  IN.

     INSIDE

     White sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden
     desk.  THE DOCTOR paces up and down in front of glass jars
     containing preserved specimens.  He stops, looks at White.

                         SCHREBER
               You remember nothing?  Who you are?
               What you've done?

                         WHITE
               You know something about me?

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't
               it?
                    (smiles)
               Is there nothing you remember?  Not
               even a detail?   You must try.

                         WHITE
               You think I haven't been trying!
                    (calms himself)
               It's like there was never anything
               there.
                    (pauses)
               Just water.

                         SCHREBER
               Water?

                         WHITE
               Waves...  A beach.  A woman
               whispering.  That's all.
                    (looks up, yawns)
               I need to stay awake.  Do you have
               any pills?

     The doctor walks to a glass cabinet and removes a bottle, takes
     out two green capsules.  Hands them to White.  Sits behind the
     desk again.

                         SCHREBER
               What does she say?  The woman.

                         WHITE
               Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just
               like a broken record.  Only thing is,
               I can't answer.  I've no idea what my
               name is.

                         SCHREBER
               Your name is John White.

                         WHITE
               That's what people keep telling me.

     Te doctor walks to a small sink in the corner, returns, hands
     White a glass of water.  White swallows the pills.

                         SCHREBER  (indicates pills)
               And what's this about?  Why?

     White stands up, starts to pace nervously.

                         SCHREBER
               Bad dreams?

                         WHITE
               Yes.

                         SCHREBER
               Tell me about them...

                         WHITE (interrupts)
               Yeah well, why don't I ask some
               questions for a change.

                         SCHREBER
               If you like.

                         WHITE
               You're supposed to be my doctor,
               right?

                         SCHREBER
               That's right.  I am your doctor.

     White is very agitated now, his voice is getting edgy.

                         WHITE
               Known me for long?

                        SCHREBER
               Well...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Am I a killer?

                         SCHREBER
               I cannot say...  You don't know the
               answer to that?

                         WHITE
               I told you, I can't remember a thing!

     White reaches across abruptly, GRABS the doctor.

                         WHITE  (angry now  -  shouting)
               Look, you know something about me,
               out with it!  Let's end this
               bullshit!  I want answers!

     The doctor is obviously scared.

                         SCHREBER
               We won't get anywhere like this.
               Please.  Let's take things in easy
               steps...


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON DRAWING PINS  -  Being pushed into a map.  A seeming
     random pattern across the terrain of the city.  Each pin is
     labelled:  VICTIM 1, VICTIM 2,...  etc.

     WIDER ON BUMSTEAD

     He's tired, like he hasn't slept.  He's looking at the map
     stuck to a wall.  There's several neat piles of folders on the
     kitchen table in front of him.  The kitchen itself is
     incredibly neat  -  everything completely organized.

     Bumstead shakes his head slowly, turns away from the board.
     Picks up a cup of hot tea, pours milk into it from a small jar.

     TIGHT ON THE TEA CUP  -  Cream SWIRLS into a rapidly dissolving
     spiral.  Bumstead looks up.  Puts down the cup hurriedly, turns
     back to the map.

     With a thick pen he traces a line between each point marking
     the location of the victims.  He steps back to examine his
     handiwork.

     A SPIRAL  -  moving outwards.  Beyond the last victim it
     becomes a dotted line, following the same trajectory but with a
     big question mark beside it.

     Bumstead glances over to a blackboard with a list of names and
     addresses on it.  He holds up the doctor's card and stares at
     it.  He turns it over, notices an address on the back.


     INT.  DOCTOR SCHREBER'S OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER is showing WHITE a series of CHARTS.  The doctor seems
     nervous about White's potential for further violence.

                         SCHREBER
               Put simply...  a penetration of the
               left parieto-occipital area of the
               cranium...  complicated by
               inflammation that resulted in
               adhesions of the brain to the
               meninges.  Without going into
               detail...  the formation of scar
               tissue altered the configuration of
               the lateral ventricles, producing
               incipient atrophy of the medulla...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Look.  It was a simple question.  Can
               someone kill and not remember it?

                         SCHREBER (smiles)
               I'm sorry.  I get carried away
               sometimes.  Possible?  I'm...  ah,
               afraid so.

                         WHITE
               Did she drown?  The woman you told me
               about?

                         SCHREBER
               Not exactly.  She was found in a
               canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut.
               Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a
               bed-sheet.

     White shakes his head, looking blankly at the doctor.

                         WHITE
               Horrible...

                         SCHREBER
               You remember nothing, eh?
                    (shakes his head)
               Let me show you something.

     Schreber turns, points to DOUBLE-DOORS.  He walks towards
     these.  White follows.

                         SCHREBER
               Formation of memories is the most
               important of brain functions.

     THE DOORS ARE OPENED

     They step into a room of living animal experiments.

                         SCHREBER
               We are little more than a sum of
               memories.  From them we reference who
               we are, where we're going.  Without a
               past we are nothing.  This is why you
               are so interesting.

                         WHITE
               I'm nothing then.

                         SCHREBER
               Anything but, my friend.

     The two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head
     missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its
     movements.

                         SCHREBER
               It feels no pain.

     White turns and starts to pace away.  Schreber reluctantly
     follows.

                         WHITE
               Can I get my life back?

                         SCHREBER
               Maybe.

     Schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing
     two rats.

                         SCHREBER
               We know of two kinds of memory.
               Firstly, declarative memory.

     The rats perform various activities involving mazes and
     geometric symbols.  Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow
     raised.

                         SCHREBER
               And then there is procedural memory.

     TIGHT ON HIS SLENDER FINGER  -  pointing to a machine also run
     by rats.  The object is to make it through a guillotine device.
     One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two.

                         SCHREBER
               Follow?

     White nods.

                         SCHREBER
               Research on simple animals can be...
               useful.  To show us where memory
               storing systems are located, for
               example.  I am building an experiment
               with hamsters next.
                    (looks at nearby cage
                    of hamsters)
               Cute little things.

     Schreber puts a hand on White's shoulder.

                         SCHREBER
               Listen to me talk!  You must be
               hungry.

     White nods again, extremely troubled.


     INT.  HALL-WAY (DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE)

     Schreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a
     maze-like series of rooms and halls.  White is led down a dark
     hall by Schreber, clutching a candle.

                         SCHREBER
               Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's
               old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed.
               Here we are.

     They've stopped outside a flaking door.


     INT.  KITCHEN

     A small eat-in kitchen.  Dirty and run-down.  White, sits at a
     bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator.  The
     doctor holds up a large FROZEN fish.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just
               how I like 'em!

     ANGLE ON FRYING PAN ON STOVE  -  The fish lands in it and starts
     to sizzle furiously.

     ANGLE ON WHITE

                         WHITE
               I'm sorry.  About before.

                         SCHREBER
               I don't blame you for getting angry.
               You are in a frustrating situation.
               You must be patient though.  Trust me
               completely.  I'm here to help.

     A set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open
     slightly and THE NURSE looks in.

                         NURSE (to Schreber)
               I have to talk to you.

                         SCHREBER
               It can't wait?

     She shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out
     again.

                         SCHREBER  (to White)
               Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at
               home.

     He leaves.

     Alone, White looks around the bleak room.  He takes off his
     coat and sits down again.  He removes the FISH.  The eye opens.
     The creature looks up at him.  It breaths painfully.

                         WHITE
               Still kicking, huh?

     He puts it back in his pocket.

     The OTHER fish is spattering oil everywhere.  Smoke starts to
     fill the room.  White, steps over and looks at the frying pan.
     The fish is turning black.  He turns the heat down.

     He notices a SMALL HOLE in the wall.  At eye height.  He steps
     across, looks through.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S eye through the hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A dark room.  Shadows on the wall.  Something wet, some kind of
     ANIMAL, moving in the darkness.  He can hear breathing and
     whispering voices.

     White's eyes start to blur, he rubs them.

                         SCHREBER O.S.
               How are things in here?

     White spins, like he's caught doing something wrong.  The
     Doctor walks across to the stove, prods the frying fish with a
     fork.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, nearly done.  So tell me about
               your dreams.  I'm very interested.

     White is having a hard time focusing.

                         WHITE
               Just the typical fabrications of a
               distorted mind.  You know, chased by
               mysterious men in black, that kind of
               thing...

     WHITE'S P.O.V.  -  ANGLE ON Schreber with his back turned, at
     the stove.  THE IMAGE is blurring.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, our friends in black...  they are
               not just a figment of your
               imagination you know, in fact none of
               what you are experiencing is anything
               but real.

     Smoke rises thickly around the doctor.

                         SCHREBER
               I know everything about you.  You
               have no choice but to trust me.

     Flames are shooting up around Schreber from the frying pan.
     His arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching
     flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire,
     his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull.

                         SCHREBER
               Scarey, isn't it?

     White startles awake.

     Schreber stands at the stove looking at White.  Everything is
     normal.

                         SCHREBER
               Are you feeling alright?

     White stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on.

                         SCHREBER
               What are you doing?

                         WHITE
               I have to go...

                         SCHREBER
               You can't go yet.  We've got so much
               to talk about...

     Suddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady
     himself.

                         SCHREBER
               You're tired.  You need to lie down.

     ON WHITE  -  swaying.

                         WHITE
               Those pills...

     HIS P.O.V.

     The scene is distorted  -  like looking through water.  Things
     start SPINNING.

                         SCHREBER (echoic)
               Yes.  A little something to help you
               relax.  Harmless...

     A tile floor RISES rapidly TOWARDS CAMERA.

                                              CUT TO:

     GREY LIMBO

     Objects float underwater.  They rise upwards amidst bubbles,
     break the surface.  A storm at sea  -  dismembered BODY PARTS
     float all the way to the horizon.

     TWO FOETUSES in separate jars are talking to each other through
     the glass.

                         FOETUS 1
               This is madness.  If we're caught...

                         FOETUS 2
               Shut-up.  Help me with these
               straps...


     INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

     WHITE wakes strapped to an exantination table.  SCHREBER and the
     NURSE loom above him.  The nurse hands Schreber a long, chrome
     SYRINGE.  The doctor moves towards White.

                         SCHREBER (holds syringe up)
               Now you must relax, Anton.

     A DOOR-BELL RINGS O.S. The nurse makes for the door.

                         SCHREBER
               Leave it!

     He's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air
     bubbles.  THE DOOR-BELL RINGS again  -  very insistent.
     Schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed.

                         SCHREBER
               Damn!  Whoever it is  -  get rid of
               them!

     She heads to the door  -  turns back.

                         NURSE
               Keys.

     Schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls
     out a huge collection of KEYS on a ring, walks to the nurse,
     hands them to her.

     White manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap
     holding him.  The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door,
     locks it.  He steps over to White.

                         SCHREBER
               I'm sorry I had to put you through
               this, Anton.
                    (lowers syringe to
                    White's forehead)
               There will be some pain, but things
               will be easier this way.

     White lashes out, PUNCHES the doctor in the face.  His glasses
     go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for
     the spectacles.

     A convenient scalpel cuts White from his remaining bonds.  He
     undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces
     his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe INTO
     WHITE'S FOREHEAD.

     The struggle continues  -  each man tries to turn the syringe
     on the other.  White pushes the doctor, who falls backwards.
     Schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical
     instruments.

     A loud THUMPING on the examination room door.  White is grabbed
     from behind, pinned down with the syringe INCHES from his face.

     A CRASH O.S.  Splintering wood.  The door bursts open.

     A ROTUND SILHOUETTE  -  is revealed, clutching a police
     special, flashing a badge.  A squeaky, over-excited, voice:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Hold it!

     Schreber and White FREEZE in mid-struggle, look at the
     inspector.  Behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Police.  Nobody move.

                         SCHREBER
               He tried to kill me!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...

     Bumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in White's face,
     handcuffs him.  Bumstead searches White, finds the revolver,
     takes this.  Also takes his wallet.  He glances at the doctor,
     who hides the syringe behind his back.

                         BUMSTEAD (to Doctor)
               You Schreber?

     Schreber nods blankly.

     Bumstead runs his hand over White's side pocket  -  feels
     something.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What's that?

     White says nothing.  The inspector opens the pocket and looks
     in.

                         BUMSTEAD (disgusted)
               A fish, huh?


     EXT.  CITY STREETS  -  NIGHT

     An old-fashioned BLACK SEDAN drives over a rusty suspension
     bridge.  Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle.  It's
     been raining.  Streets are empty.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     WHITE and the INSPECTOR drive silently.  Bumstead has appointed
     his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home.
     Hot thermos.  Note pad holder, complete with light.  Coat
     hanger.  Gun rack.  A system for everything.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit!
                    (glances at his
                    watch)
               I'm curious?  How many so far?

     He shakes his watch, puts it to his ear.

                         WHITE (confused)
               What?  I...

                         BUMSTEAD (counts on fingers)
               Let's see, there's the little guy
               with no arms or legs.  And the young
               boy?

                         WHITE (disturbed)
               Young boy?

     CLOSE ON WHITE  -  frightened now.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The six year old.  Sure, you
               remember.

     Bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard.  A SANDWICH,
     carefully wrapped and prepared.  After glancing at his watch
     again, he bites into it.

                         BUMSTEAD (chewing)
               Y'know, the kid you left in the meat
               packing plant, cut into pieces.
               Packed into brown paper parcels,
               wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.

     No answer.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You sure have demonstrated a great
               deal of...  imagination.  The baby
               was the best though.  Several cops
               lost their lunch over that one.  Head
               twisted off, spine pulled out,
               yeech...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Stop it.  You're making me sick...

                         BUMSTEAD
               We count seven so far.  Anyone we
               missed?

     RADIO CRACKLE O.S.  -  A tinny voice cuts in.

                         VOICE
               Inspector Bumstead...  Inspector...

     Bumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is it, Crenshaw?

                         CRENSHAW
               Just reminding you...  your eight pee
               em...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit.
                    (looks at watch)
               Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw.
               Remind me to give you my watch.  It
               needs fixing.

                         CRENSHAW
               Yes sir.

     Bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a
     SHARP CORNER as he finishes off the sandwich.

                         WHITE
               Where are we going?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Shut-up.

     Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from
     his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel.

     White is silent  -  his wounds continue to bother him.  He
     leans down to scratch through his trousers.

                         WHITE (quietly)
               Shit!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Gesundheit!

                         WHITE (looks up)
               I didn't sneeze.


     EXT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE  -  NIGHT

     The INSPECTOR's car pulls up and stops.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE
               What are we doing here?

     Bumstead grabs a bunch of flowers off the back seat.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Get out.


     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pushes the handcuffed WHITE through a swinging metal
     door.  They enter a sterile air-conditioned room.  An
     effeminate MALE NURSE sits behind a glassed-in counter.
     Directly opposite is a small WAITING ROOM through a glass
     panelled door.  Bumstead pushes White into this room.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Wait here.

     The inspector shuts the door behind him.  White looks about the
     blank room, takes a seat.  He can see Bumstead, through the
     glass panel in the door, walk up to the male nurse opposite.

     OUT IN THE CORRIDOR

     The inspector talks to the male nurse through a tiny opening in
     the window.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Bumstead.  I'm here to see my mother.

     BACK TO WHITE

     He cannot hear anything of what Bumstead is saying.  He sees
     him take out his wallet and show his badge.  The male nurse is
     concerned, looks over towards White, then opens a drawer, hands
     Bumstead a KEY.  The inspector steps back to the waiting room
     door and LOCKS IT from the outside.  He looks at White for a
     moment, then walks away, along the corridor.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM

     Bumstead enters darkness  -  pneumatic MACHINE NOISE fills the
     gloom.  He walks quietly to his mother, encased in a metallic
     contraption, something like an iron lung.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)
               Brought you these.

     He places flowers on the bedside table.  His mother just stares
     expressionless into space, in a coma.  He sits on a metal
     chair, looks at the woman.  Her life-sustaining machines hiss
     and breathe.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A FINGER presses down on the sticky surface of a page.  It
     pulls away revealing an inky finger-print.

     WIDER

     White is standing in a bare room, in front of a finger-printing
     machine.  He's alone.  A blast of electrical FEED-BACK.  White
     looks up at a speaker mounted to the wall.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE  (through speaker)
               Move  -  forward.

     White follows a painted line on the floor, stands against a
     wall, in front of an old-fashioned camera.  A slot opens in the
     wall behind him, mechanical arms spring forward, restrain him,
     one arm holds a sign with a number in front of him.  A flash
     goes off, the click of a shutter.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Left  -  profile.

     A claw lowers from the ceiling, grips White's head, turns it
     abruptly  -  the camera fires.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Right  -  profile.

     The claw turns his head the other way.  The camera fires again.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     Across the room A BUZZER SOUNDS, a red light flashes above a
     door.  White is released by the mechanical hands, walks over,
     opens the door and steps into darkness.

     LIGHTS COME ON  -  extremely bright.  A room for line-ups  -
     markings on the white wall behind White indicate varying
     heights, a darkened window faces him.  He is obviously to be
     identified by an unseen person.

     A buzzer sounds again, a light indicates another door.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     White moves into another room.  A chair faces a large wheel
     painted in a black and white spiral.  He sits down  -  the
     wheel turns, faster and faster.

                         VOICE
               Watch  -  the  - wheel.

     The wheel stops after several seconds.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is full of scientific equipment.

                         VOICE
               Stand  -  behind  -  the  -  screen.

     White sees a metal-frame X-ray machine  -  he steps across to
     it.  The screen lights up, filling the room with a green glow.
     We can see the shape of his skeleton.  Where his pocket would
     be, is the tiny skeleton of the fish.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is empty.

                         VOICE
               Face  -  the  - wall.

     White turns.  As soon as he has done this hears a door open
     behind him.  FOOTSTEPS approach.  Blows rain down on him, fists,
     boots, clubs.  He slides to the floor.  The lights go out.


     INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

     LIGHTS come on again.  White is dazed  -  in a chair, a bright
     light in his face blinds him.

                         VOICE
               What's your name?

                         WHITE  (squints into light)
               I don't remember.

                         VOICE
               Oh, no?

     White shakes his head slowly and looks at the floor.  The light
     is angled away, pointed down towards A TABLE.  White can see
     now.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A featureless room.  STROMBOLI stands over him, behind him is
     BUMSTEAD and two shadowy guards.  Bumstead picks up an
     envelope, removes a SERIES OF PHOTOS, hands these to Stromboli.

                         STROMBOLI
               John...

     He throws the first shot down on the table in front of White.
     A black and white police photo of a murder victim.

                         STROMBOLI
               ...Murderer.

     Another photo goes down.  Another victim.  Another and another.
     Each more grisly than the last.

                         STROMBOLI
               You'll sign a confession?

     White nods.  He's looks utterly lost.

     Bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near
     the only door, presses a button.

                         BUMSTEAD (into speaker)
               Okay.

     TWO GUARDS immediately step through the door, GRAB White by his
     arms.  They carry him off.


     INT.  PRISON CELL

     White is woken by a UNIFORMED GUARD shining a light in his
     eyes.

                         GUARD
               Visitor.


     INT.  VISITING ROOM

     White is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier
     down the middle.  The guard tells him to sit and wait.

     The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  -
     DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened.

                         WHITE  (to guard)
               Keep him away:  He's insane.

     The guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly.

                         SCHREBER
               Please, stay calm.

                         WHITE  (to guard)
               This man wants to kill me.

     The guard remains indifferent.

                         SCHREBER  (to guard)
               Just one of his many delusions  -
               it's nothing.
                    (a whisper to White)
               Shut up!  Listen, damn you!  This is
               a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't
               get another chance like this.  Listen
               to me.

                         WHITE  (turns to Doctor)
               What do you want?

                         SCHREBER
               You're innocent...
                    (still a whisper)
               You didn't kill anyone.

                         WHITE  (sarcastic)
               What am I doing in here then?

                         SCHREBER
               Listen to what I have to say.  Decide
               for yourself.

     AN ADJOINING ROOM

     The dark silhouettes of BUMSTEAD and ANOTHER COP watch from
     behind a two-way mirror.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What's he doing here?

                         COP
               Says he is the man's doctor...
                    (taps side of his
                    head)
               You know...

                         BUMSTEAD
               I know it's his doctor...
                    (into intercom)
               I need the file on..
                    (reads clip-board)
               Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.

                         MISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S.
               Schreber.  Yes.  Isn't that his
               doctor?

                         BUMSTEAD (evenly)
               Yes.
                    (beat)
               And it's SCHREBER  -  with an 'h'.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes.  An "h".

     The inspector looks up from the speaker.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  THROUGH THE MIRROR, White seems to have calmed
     down.

     BACK IN THE VISITING ROOM

                         SCHREBER
               The men in black  -  they're the
               killers.

     White stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass.

                         WHITE
               You're a liar!

                         SCHREBER
               No, it's the truth.

                         WHITE
               So you're telling me the truth this
               time?  Is that it!

     The doctor removes a SMALL SYRINGE from his black bag, places
     it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the
     guard's view.

                         SCHREBER
               If you would only take this, inject
               it in your brain, everything would be
               much clearer.

                         WHITE
               Not that again...

                         SCHREBER
               Everyone get's one  -  very much like
               this...
                    (points to syringe)
               But this one's special.  It will help
               you understand, everything...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               I'm not injecting anything into my
               brain.

                         SCHREBER
               Anton  -  I mean, John, there
               has been an experiment, a dangerous
               experiment.  I arranged it.  It was a
               lie from the beginning.  It almost
               worked, but things did not go as they
               should have.  You have been left  -
               blank.

     Schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him.

                         SCHREBER
               You can change this, all this.
                    (points at syringe
                    again)
               But you must take it.

     White stares blankly at him for a moment, then:

                         WHITE
               You've been working too hard.

                         SCHREBER
               Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is
               short.  Let me show you something.
               Look at this syringe.

                         WHITE
               Why?

                         SCHREBER
               Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at
               it.

     White reluctantly does this.

                         SCHREBER
               Concentrate.  Imagine the syringe
               rising.  Picture it floating above the
               table.

     TIGHT ON WHITE

                         SCHREBER
               Do it!

     WHITE'S P.O.V.

     The syringe starts to vibrate, actually RISES INTO THE AIR  -
     floats stationary between White and Schreber.

                         WHITE
               It's a trick.

                         SCHREBER
               No it isn't.  You are doing it!  Now
               raise it over the glass and...

     Suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor, IMPALES itself
     in his shoulder.  He yelps, grabs it.

                         WHITE
               Oh, sorry...

     The doctor pulls out the syringe, is about to say more when a
     BUZZER SOUNDS.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Your  -  time  -  is  -  up.

     Schreber looks to where the voice came from  -  a speaker above
     their heads.

                         SCHREBER (looks at White)
               I gave you your chance, now it's too
               late.  They'll learn you are here
               soon.  It's all over.


     INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR

     DOCTOR SCHREBER paces towards the exit.  BUMSTEAD steps in
     front of him.  The doctor is startled.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Doctor!  What brings you here?

                         SCHREBER
               Just visiting my patient.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Really?  And how is his state of
               mind?

                         SCHREBER
               He's seriously disturbed...

     The doctor is nervous, glancing about.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You seem a little edgy.  Everything
               okay?

                         SCHREBER
               Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...

     He tries to push past.  Bumstead grabs his arm.

                         BUMSTEAD
               To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've
               run into each other like this.  Maybe
               you can help me tidy some loose ends.

                         SCHREBER
               Loose ends?

     SCHREBER looks like a trapped animal, when:

                         VOICE O.S.
               Bumstead!

     Bumasead turns to look down the corridor.  He sees STROMBOLI
     peaking out of his office door.

                         STROMBOLI
               I need to speak to you.  Immediately.

     The door shuts again.  Bumstead turns back.  The doctor is GONE
     -  the corridor empty.


     INT.  HOLDING CELL

     White is staring through a glass door at A COP.  A KETTLE
     WHISTLES O.S.  The cop gets up and moves off.

     White looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small WINDOW, high up on the wall.  Impossible to get to,
     even if his hands weren't cuffed.  Nothing he can do  -  he
     looks at a clock on a wall.

     PUSH IN on the clock  -  TICKING GETS LOUDER.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD enters STROMBOLI'S office.  A nervous CHIEF-INSPECTOR
     is flanked by TWO STRANGE-LOOKING MEN in ill-fitting brown
     suits.

                         STROMBOLI
               Bumstead, these...  er, gentlemen are
               here to collect White.

     Bumstead suspiciously eyes the two men, beside STROMBOLI'S
     desk.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to men)
               Who are you?

                         STROMBOLI (even more nervous)
               Please, Bumstead.  Co-operate  -
               it's easier.

                         BUMSTEAD
               This is highly irregular.  I have a
               right to know.

                         MAN 1
               We are from a mental asylum.

     He notices that this man's moustache is LOP-SIDED.  The other
     man wears spectacles WITH NO LENSES in the frames, clutches an
     un-lit pipe in his teeth.

                         STROMBOLI
               Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he
               needs expert help.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I see...

                         MAN 1
               Yes, Inspector.  Has he been
               displaying any strange...  behaviour?

                         BUMSTEAD
               He's been a little angel...

                         STROMBOLI
               If you could show them to the holding
               cell now.

     SLOW MOVE IN on Bumstead's face.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     Bumstead and the MYSTERY MEN walk towards the holding cell.
     Bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he
     enters.  IT'S EMPTY.

     He fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket  -  BURSTS into
     the room.  White is gone.  But where?  Bumstead throws a look
     back TO THE FRONT DESK.

                         MAN 1
               Where is he?

     The cop is just returning, holding a cup of coffee.  He looks
     at the inspector, sees the room is empty.  A nervous twitch
     knocks the cup from the cop's hands.

     TIGHT ON THE CUP  -  smashing on the floor.


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION  -  NIGHT

     Underground.  CONSTANT NOISE O.S. of trains arriving and
     departing but none are seen.

     CAMERA MOVES PAST broken tiles on a wall to REVEAL:  WHITE  -
     sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused,
     groggy from sleep.  He looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully
     tries to free them from the cuffs.

     MOVE IN TIGHT ON WHITE

     He starts to cry.  He puts his head in his hands, his body
     spasms with each sob.

     SEVERAL ANGLES of the empty corridors of the subway.  White's
     crying is heard  -  echoic.

     BACK ON WHITE  -  A small feminine HAND touches his head.

     Startled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be
     attacked.

     THE BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN from the church looks down at him.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD and the COP are getting grilled by STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't
               understand how it was possible.  The
               only window was twenty feet up a
               vertical wall, he was cuffed...

                         STROMBOLI
                    (shouts at cringing
                    COP)
               How could you have been so stupid?
 
                         COP
               I'm sorry, sir.

                         STROMBOLI
               Alright, get out.

     Bumstead gets up and leaves.

                         STROMBOLI
               You stay.

     The cop hustles out, shuts the door.

                         STROMBOLI
               Bumstead, you're starting to annoy
               me.  This case is very important to
               me.  Just a little warning:  I've got
               my eye on you inspector, remember
               that.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir.

     He leaves.


     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING

     White, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat,
     follows the JAPANESE WOMAN up a flight of dark stairs.  she
     keeps looking back at him, smiling but SAYS NOTHING.


     INT.  APARTMENT

     White and the woman step into a run-down apartment.  She points
     to a couch.  White looks uncomfortable.  She smiles again, then
     turns on the radio.  MUSIC.

     She steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving White alone.  He
     gets up and starts to tune the radio.  A babble of fragments of
     voices and music, then:  A NEWS REPORT...

                         NEWS READER O.S.
               ...earlier this evening it was
               reported a man fitting his
               description had been apprehended.

     White listens nervously.

                         NEWS READER O.S.
               ...and now for a message from LUMP-O
               food products...

     Across the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar.  He
     crosses to the doorway and looks in.  The woman stands naked
     against a deep red wall, her back turned.  She has an elaborate
     TATTOO on her back  -  looks like an INSECT.  She puts on a
     dressing gown and TURNS SUDDENLY.

     White steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the
     couch.

     She steps from the doorway holding a BAR OF SOAP in her hand.
     She sits down beside White and takes his hands, gently
     lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at
     him.  White looks down.

     His hands seem to have SHRUNK  -  they poke out of his sleeves
     like tiny children's limbs.  The cuffs effortlessly slip off.

     White looks at the woman, then back at his hands  -  NOTHING
     STRANGE, they are normal size, but somehow the cuffs have been
     removed.  He looks at the woman again, grateful.  He can't help
     smiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Her eyes.  Her lips.  Her neck.  She leans forward, goes OUT OF
     FOCUS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     She touches her tongue to his lips.  Kisses his face.  She
     pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open.
     White does not respond  -  seems uncertain.  She sits upright,
     astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses
     his chest.  She stops, her face in shadow.

     Slowly, White lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them.
     She starts to breath deeply.

     OUT OF FOCUS  -  their bodies entangle, begin to move
     rhythmically.  The CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS, REVEALS a microphone
     behind a chair, leads us to a mirror on a wall.  On the other
     side of the one-way glass a reel-to-reel tape recorder is
     picking up the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING.

     OUTSIDE

     The building the lovers are in SLOWLY RISES into the air, past
     taller buildings and floats out over the city.  Its shadow
     moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers.

     INSIDE

     White sleeps, as buildings move past outside the window.  He
     opens his eyes, FORCES himself awake.  Looks across the dark
     room.

     The JAPANESE WOMAN stands naked at the window, clutching a
     large red megaphone.  IN PERFECT ENGLISH she shouts down at the
     streets drifting past.

                         JAPANESE WOMAN
               He's up here!  He raped me!  Hurry!
               Before he kills again!

     OUTSIDE

     MYSTERY MEN stand on roof-tops, watching the building drift
     past.

     BACK IN THE ROOM

     White runs to the window, GRABS the woman.  As they struggle,
     the building is landing softly in another part of the city.

     LONG SHADOWS move towards the entrance...

     WHITE WAKES UP AGAIN  -  finds he is still on the couch.  NO
     SIGN of the woman.  Then he notices her standing by the window
     (minus megaphone).  The wind pulls at her black hair.  A
     distant SIREN O.S.

     He gets up, walks over, stands beside her, looks out at the
     dark city.  She ignores him, goes back to the couch, turns on a
     table-lamp, puts her hands before the lit bulb, casts animal
     shadows on the wall.

     White watches her.  He walks across and sits next to her.  She
     points to herself.

                         WOMAN  (a whisper)
               Sachiko.

     He nods slowly, looks at her.  She waits for him to respond
     with his name.  He shrugs, remains silent.  Then he puts his
     hands in the light, makes his own animal shadow.

                         WHITE
               That's me.  I'm a shadow.

     She smiles at the shadows.

                         WHITE
               Do I look like a murderer to you?

     She just keeps smiling, not understanding.  Kisses him. He
     notices an old phone on a corner table, removes the note again
     and rings the same number.  This time, after several rings the
     call is answered.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.
               Yes?...  Who is this?...  Who's
               there?...

     White remains silent.  Sachiko stands and leaves the room.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.
               John?  Is that you?

                         WHITE
               Who is this?  What do you know about
               me?

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko hesitates momentarily.
     She slides a hand into White's coat, removes the wallet.  She
     takes out some cash, puts the wallet back, then she MOVES OFF.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pulls up in his car.  Across the street is DOCTOR
     SCHREBER'S surgery.

     He is about to get out of the car, when the SURGERY DOOR OPENS
     and A FIGURE steps into the street.  Bumstead watches the
     shadowy man for a moment.  Then gets out and FOLLOWS, assuming
     it is Schreber.

     ALLEYWAY

     Bumstead follows inconspicuously.  Without warning, the figure
     stops and TURNS.  Bumstead backs into a doorway to hide.  He
     gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a MYSTERY MAN in the
     dim light of the alley.

     When Bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of
     the Man  -  like he disappeared into thin air.  A SHADOW
     crosses the wall beside Bumstead.  He spins, looking around
     behind him.  Then he looks up into the air.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The shadow of a LEVITATING FIGURE crosses the face of a
     building.


     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING PASSAGEWAY  -  NIGHT

     SOUND OF A WOMAN SOBBING O.S.  A wet dog sits in a corner
     gnawing a bone.  A crackly voice recites a list of names from a
     small speaker-box mounted to a wall.  A TREMBLING FINGER
     presses a door buzzer.

     SACHIKO, opens the door and looks out.

     ANGLE ON  -  A STRANGE WOMAN in the dark corridor adjusting her
     hair nervously.  She pushes past the Japanese woman, into the
     room.

     INSIDE

                         WOMAN
               John.

     WHITE stands inside the room, looking at the woman,
     expressionless. The woman suddenly leaps forward, grabs him,
     kisses him passionately.

     White tries to push her away, but she takes his hand, pulls it
     inside her dress, makes him touch her breasts.  He pushes
     harder, she trips on a chair, falls to the floor.  She starts
     to cry.


     EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING FACADE

     The CAMERA MOVES past flaking bricks  -  to a window.  Behind
     the glass WHITE and SACHIKO sit across from the WOMAN who
     attacked White.  She is talking, though nothing can be heard,
     drying her eyes with a handkerchief.

     INSIDE

     The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs.

                         WOMAN
               Please believe me.  It's me, John.
               Your WIFE.  I wouldn't lie to you.
               You told me I could come and see you
               -  now you want to just send me away
               again...

     White looks AT THE FLOOR.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  a crack in the floorboards  -  movement
     underneath.

                         WHITE
               I thought it would make more sense.
               I'm getting the pieces, but when I
               put it together it feels like...
               Like you're telling me about somebody
               else's life...

                         WIFE
               It's the truth...  I need you.  I
               know you're innocent.

                         WHITE
               How do you know I'm innocent?

                         WIFE
               Of course you are.  You couldn't do
               those terrible things.  Come home with
               me  -  maybe things will make sense
               then...

                         WHITE
               I can't do that.  It's dangerous.
               What about my parents?  Do you know
               where I can find them?

                         WIFE
               They're dead, John.

     He stands and walks to the window  -  looks out at the city.

                         WIFE
               You have an uncle.  You were very
               close.

     She fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles
     something on a piece of paper, hands it to White.

                         WIFE
               This is where he lives. I'm sure he
               would like to see you.

                         WHITE (taking paper)
               Thanks.

                         WIFE (looks at him for a beat)
               Don't you want me?   My body?
               Remember how my skin feels?  Touch
               it.  I...

     She notices Sachiko  -  becomes self-conscious.  Sachiko
     silently stands and leaves the room.  The wife puts her face in
     her hands, overcome with tears.

                         WHITE
               What's your name?

                         WIFE  (looks up  -  still sobbing)
               Elizabeth.

     White removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his
     wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face  -  it
     matches.

                         WHITE  (thoughtful)
               Yes...

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple.  She
     MOVES OFF.

                         ELIZABETH
               I want to help...

                         WHITE
               Alright.  Here...

     He pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman
     can see it.

                         WHITE
               Know this place?

     She looks at the card.

                         ELIZABETH  (stops crying)
               Of course.  Your home town  -  where
               you grew up...

     White stands abruptly, startling the woman.  He glares down at
     her intensely.

                         WHITE
               How do I get there?  Tell me.

                         WIFE
               That's easy.  You...

     She trails off into silence.  Her hand, about to point in a
     certain direction, freezes in mid-air.

                         ELIZABETH
               ...strange, I forgot.

     White sits back down quietly.

                         WHITE
               Yes.  Very strange.


     INT.  BATHROOM

     Sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of
     the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor.

     Underneath is a TRAP-DOOR.  Opening it, she climbs down a
     hole.

     UNDER THE FLOOR

     In the semi-darkness she moves to a WOODEN BOX.  She cranks a
     small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open.  Music
     plays softly.

     She looks into the yawning black mouth of the box.  A WORM-LIKE
     apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her
     thigh.  She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes.


     INT.  TENEMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR

     LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  -  feet walk along a tattered rug,
     approach a door.  Bumstead's shoes, shiny as always.


     INT.  TENEMENT ROOM

     A KNOCK ON THE DOOR startles a huddled man in a blanket,
     sitting before a small t.v. set.  This is THOMPSON  -  the
     detective with mental problems.  He's unshaven, haunted.

     Clutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy-
     hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Bumstead, back turned, glancing at his watch.

     Thompson backs away, points his gun at the figure through the
     door.

                         THOMPSON
               Go away!

                         BUMSTEAD O.S.
               Open up, Thompson.  It's me...

     Thompson puts his eye to the door again.

                         THOMPSON
               Bumstead?

     THROUGH THE SPY-HOLE LENS the inspector turns, looks at us, his
     face DISTORTED, fish-like.  Thompson undoes four locks, opens
     the door a crack, but leaves it chained.

                         THOMPSON
               Can't let you in...  sorry.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I'm on the serial killer case, need
               to talk.

                         THOMPSON
               Not that.  Anything else.

     Thompson wipes at the sweat on his forehead.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You don't look so well...  C'mon, let
               me in Thompson.

     Thompson stares at Bumstead, then silently unchains the door
     and lets him through.

                         THOMPSON
               I can't talk about that.  As long as
               you understand, that's all.

     The room is very dark.  Bumstead is assailed by a wave of
     putrid smells.  It's a mess  -  rotten food, overturned
     furniture, dirty clothes.

                         THOMPSON
               Pull up some garbage  -  make
               yourself at home.

     Thompson smiles weakly.  They sit down, face each other in the
     gloom.  A RAT scuttles past Thompson.  With lightning reflexes
     he throws a shoe at it.  The rat runs under a table.  He looks
     back at Bumstead, smiles, slightly insane.

                         THOMPSON
               They've taken my mind, my memories...

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?  Who has?

                         THOMPSON
               Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't
               remember...
                    (looks around)
               Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off
               this case.  Now.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is going on?

                         THOMPSON (looks more frightened)
               Wish I could tell you, Bumstead.
               Strange business.  I...
               AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!

     He screams horribly.  Stands, clutching his head.  Startled,
     Bumstead falls backwards off his chair.  Thompson, still
     clutching his head, runs and starts POUNDING HIS FACE against
     the wall.

                         THOMPSON
               Get away!  Leave me alone!

     Thompson's head is CHANGING  -  bloating.  It rapidly elongates
     into a pink fleshy tube.

     Thompson's head continues to grow -  his features are lost
     beneath folds of skin.  His screaming is stifled.  Thompson
     falls to the floor.  His head HUGE NOW  -  larger than his
     body.  Small tendrils sprout from the main appendage.

     Bumstead takes cover behind a sofa.

     Then, as violently as the head began to transform, it stops.

     Bumstead peaks over the sofa at the huge throbbing purple
     growth sprouting from Thompson's collar.  At the top of the
     growth an orifice opens.

     An EXPLOSION of green bile spouts into the room  -  covers
     everything in sight...

     Then the head starts to shrink.  Thompson's features appear
     again. It returns to normal size.  Thompson groans, sprawled on
     the floor, clutching his head.

     Bumstead looks on in horror.

                         THOMPSON
               It's  -  it's disgusting, I know...

     Thompson's face is heavily bruised, covered in sweat.  His nose
     starts to bleed  -  he wipes it on his sleeve.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jesus!  We have to get you to a
               doctor...

                         THOMPSON
               No...  No doctor...

     Bumstead stands unsteadily.

                         BUMSTEAD
               But...  How long has this been
               happening?

                         THOMPSON
               A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno,
               I can't remember.
                    (stands slowly)
               Worse thing is, I never know if it
               will change back again...  Now,
               please leave me alone.


     INT.  APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

     WHITE, ELIZABETH and SACHIKO sit around a small table, eating
     quietly.

     Without warning, Elizabeth starts to cry again.  White tries to
     ignore her. Sachiko looks sadly at the wife, puts a hand on her
     shoulder, gives her a handkerchief.  The woman quietens down.

     They resume eating but in no time Elizabeth again bursts into
     tears.  White looks at her now.

                         ELIZABETH  (through sobs)
               Sorry...

     Sachiko leans across and puts her arm around Elizabeth, helps
     her to her feet.  Elizabeth hangs onto the woman as she is led
     from the room.  White can hear the sobbing still, as the women
     move through to the bedroom.


     INT.  BEDROOM

     They sit on the edge of the bed  -  Sachiko holds Elizabeth's
     hand, smiles at her.

                         ELIZABETH (calmer now)
               I'm sorry...  This is embarrassing  -
               my husband doesn't know who I am...

     With this, she starts to cry again.

     Sachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses Elizabeth's lips.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON TWO MYSTERY MEN speaking in whispers.  The Men
     continue talking as THE CAMERA RISES, through several levels of
     concrete and machinery TO REVEAL:


     EXT.  ROOF-TOP  -  NIGHT

     OTHER MYSTERY MEN are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna
     device.

     BACK DOWN IN THE DARK CHAMBER

     The group of MYSTERY MEN have gathered once again.  One
     addresses them all.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               The line of junction between two
               edges!

                         MEN  (unison)
               YES!

                         MYSTERY MAN
               We have located him.  Now is the
               time, yes.

     A switch is thrown.  Electricity sparks to life.  A hum is in
     the air.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               Let the tuning commence!

     The congregation of MEN place ELECTRODES to their foreheads in
     a trance-like manner.  They chant, quietly at first, steadily
     building in volume.  The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to
     some inner beat.

     The CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.  A
     representation of a man's legs.  Trousers rolled up above the
     knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh.
     Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion
     -  the legends are an unknown language.

     ON THE ROOF

     The antenna glows with a ghostly green light.  O.S. SCREAMS
     RISE UP FROM THE STREET.


     INT.  APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  LATER

     White downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the
     window.  O.S. distant screams.

     He glances across to a wall, notices A FLY there  -  something
     about it looks WRONG.

     FLY'S P.O.V.

     A distorted electronic image of White's FACE looming up.

     At exactly that moment the FLY TAKES OFF, flies erratically
     down the hall, around a turn and disappears.  White follows.

     HALL-WAY

     White moves quietly towards the bedroom door.

     HIS P.O.V.

     It is ajar, dark inside.  Movement.  The women are naked on the
     bed.  The JAPANESE WOMAN has her eyes shut, head back in
     ecstasy. The WIFE is bent over her, kissing her stomach.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  watching through the crack in the door.  The
     women are oblivious.

     He moves away slowly, feeling strange.  His feet stop making
     contact with the floor.  He grabs a table to steady himself.
     The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and
     smash. He's FLOATING.

     White desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the
     light-fixture in the ceiling.  It breaks off in a cloud of
     plaster.  Sparks briefly illuminate.  He falls heavily ONTO THE
     CEILING  -  now the floor.  The apartment is upside down.

     He stares up at furniture and objects.

     THE BATHROOM

     White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing
     heater stuck to the floor.  Water is running  -  filling the
     tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's
     head.

     White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the
     floor.  It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off.
     Pulls himself towards the tub.

     Gravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water.
     He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath.  Submerges
     his face.  A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart
     somewhere in the building.

     He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A blurry DARK FIGURE moves into his vision.  It stares down at
     him.

     White rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the
     thin veil of water.  The FIGURE reaches out.  A GLOVED HAND
     grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully.  White
     gulps for air, swallows water.  His eyes widen.  He tries to
     stop the hand strangling him but can't.

     Suddenly the hand pulls away.  The BLURRY FIGURE stumbles back
     and ERUPTS into bloody explosion.  The body splits apart,
     throwing internal organs through the room.

     White awakens in the bathtub.  He looks about the room.  Empty.
     Silent.  He gets out of the water, starts to dress.


     EXT.  BUILDING

     BUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.  He gets out, stained here and there
     with bile.


     INT.  APARTMENT

     A HIGH ANGLE on the slain bodies of the JAPANESE WOMAN and
     WHITE'S WIFE.  TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing
     stuff.  Bumstead walks up to the cop in charge.

                         COP
               All the same entry wounds.  It's
               definitely him.
                    (indicates Sachiko's
                    corpse)
               She lives...  lived here.  A
               prostitute.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The other one?

                         COP
               His wife.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jesus.  Small world.
                    (looks around)
               Where's the photographer?

                         COP
               No one available.

     A third YOUNG COP steps up to the cop in charge, glancing at
     the bile on Bumstead's suit.

                         YOUNG COP
               They won't come out.

                         COP
               We'll interrogate them anyway.

     The cop leads Bumstead behind a WOODEN PARTITION.  A small area
     neatly arranged  -  a double bed, various possessions.  Someone
     obviously lives here.  The room is empty however.

                         COP
               This is the family of the victim  -
               apparently they were in the apartment
               when he committed...

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks around empty room)
               What are you talking about?

                         COP
               Oh, yes...

     He walks to THE BED, bends over and lifts the bed-spread.  In
     the shadows underneath, Bumstead can make out SEVERAL FACES.  A
     man, an old woman, three or four children.

                         COP
               They don't speak English...

                         BUMSTEAD
               How will we interrogate them?

                         COP
               Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.

     Under the bed, Bumstead can see a LITTLE GIRL.  He walks over
     to her.  She puts a hand over her mouth, edges away.

                         BUMSTEAD
               It's alright.  I won't hurt you.

     Without coming out from under the bed she hands the inspector a
     crumpled paper.  He looks at it then glances over his shoulder.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The wooden room divider.  The CAMERA MOVES IN steadily, into a
     crack running along the length of the divider  -  we can see
     the room on the other side, with the cops moving about.

     Bumstead looks back at the page he holds in his hands.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A child-like DRAWING.  Two men, stick figures, dressed in
     black, with impossibly big knifes, slash at two screaming
     women.

     Unmistakable  -  MYSTERY MEN.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     DOCTOR SCHREBER walks stiffly into the room and sits at the
     head of a boardroom table.  He's cold, pulls his coat up about
     his neck.  The long table is lined on both sides with immobile
     MYSTERY MEN.

     A DARK FIGURE walks into the room, steps up to the other end of
     the table.  This is the enigmatic MISTER BLACK  -  only ever
     seen hidden in shadow.

                         MISTER BLACK  (addressing Men)
               Gentlemen.
                    (peers at Schreber)
               Doctor.

     He sits, dark and mysterious.

                         MISTER BLACK
               I have called this meeting for a
               purpose, yes?
                    (turns to Schreber)
               It is clear to you we are  -
               unhappy, yes?

                         SCHREBER
               Yes, of course.  I...

                         MISTER BLACK
               The tuning failed  -  when our agents
               arrived he was gone.  He knows things
               -  predicts things.  Explain to us,
               Doctor.  Why is the situation this
               way?  Yes?

     Schreber seems distinctly uncomfortable.

                         SCHREBER
               I'm not certain I fully understand
               myself...

                         MISTER BLACK
               No excuses, dearest Doctor!  Answers.
               Yes?

                         MYSTERY MEN  (chant in unison)
               Answers!  Answers!

                         MISTER BLACK
               You said this would be containable!
               Nothing works this time.  Why is this
               so?

                         MYSTERY MEN
               Why!  Why!

                         SCHREBER
               I  -  ah  -  I...  it's a little cold
               in here don't you think?

                         MISTER BLACK
               We must find him.  This is your
               responsibility.

                         SCHREBER (thinking fast)
               Yes, of course...


     INT.  INSPECTOR'S OFFICE

     Bumstead once again scratches his head in front of a map.  The
     little girl's drawing is pinned to his board.  His attention
     wanders.  He notices a FLY CRAWLING across the wall in front of
     his face.  He leans closer, studying it.

     The intercom crackles to life.  The insect flies off.

                         MISS CRENSHAW  (through intercom)
               A call, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Who is it?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Put it through...

     A light flashes.  Bumstead picks up.

                         BUMSTEAD
               This is Bumstead.  Who is this?

     He listens intently.


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S OFFICE

     BUMSTEAD enters.  He looks nervous.  His SECRETARY sits at her
     desk in an adjoining office, filing her nails.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I need everything on the Jonathan
               White case.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  Everything?

                         BUMSTEAD
               All the important stuff.  Wrap it up
               for me.

     The inspector turns to face her, a little manic. She is staring
     at him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Please  -  I'm in a hurry.

                         MISS CRENSHAW (evenly)
               Certainly.


     EXT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD steps from the doorway and walks across to his car
     briskly.


     INT.  BATH-HOUSE

     Bumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels
     and swimming outfits, waiting silently.  They sit lined by a
     wall, staring into space.

     Bumstead walks into a larger tiled room, full of steam.  He
     walks beside a heated pool  -  naked people swim about weakly
     or sit on the edge washing themselves.  He steps up to A FULLY
     DRESSED MAN, sitting silently on a bench.  It is WHITE.

     A feint smile brushes across White's lips as he looks up at the
     inspector.  He looks away, like he's forgotten something.
     Stands, walks over to the pool, cups his hand, bends down,
     scoops some water.

     Bumstead sees White has picked up the LITTLE SILVER FISH.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why give yourself up?

                         WHITE
               I  -  ah - couldn't think of
               anything else to do.  I thought maybe
               you know something...
                    (beat)
               I'm scared.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That was a pretty good escape act at
               the station.  How did you do that?

                         WHITE
               I woke up in a subway.  I don't know
               how I got there.

                         BUMSTEAD  (not convinced)
               Uh-huh.
                    (pauses)
               What are you scared of?

                         WHITE
               People...  after me.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Who?

                         WHITE
               I don't know who they are.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why are they after you?

                         WHITE
               Don't know that either.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Don't know much, do you?


     INT.  LABORATORY  -  NIGHT

     Metal scraping.

     PIANO ACCORDION MUSIC wafts on a breeze, someone breathing.

     HIGH ANGLE  -  Down through an OPENING metal hatch.  A dim
     laboratory IS REVEALED  -  a maze of scientific instruments.
     Elongated shadows move about.

     MYSTERY MEN are hunched over something.  Behind them a
     diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain.

     MAN 1 bends across to a CONTROL PANEL, works a switch.  A small
     speaker in a metal box crackles to life.  SOUND OF DISTANT
     SURF.  A WOMAN'S VOICE:

                         VOICE
               What is your name...  What is your
               name...

     Wires lead from the metal box to a HUMAN BRAIN within a
     metallic container.  Electricity arches across electrodes.

     More sounds from the speaker:  WATER BUBBLING.  HIGH HEELS WALK
     DOWN STAIRS.  BED-SPRINGS.  LOVERS MOAN PASSIONATELY.

     MAN 2 steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their
     handiwork.

     A PUPPET-LIKE CREATURE is revealed.  Small  -  two and half
     feet tall.  The top of its head an open hatch containing the
     BRAIN.  Wires lead to this.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET'S EYES  -  They glance about the room. Its body
     is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces.

     MAN 1 shines a torch into the puppet's eyes.

     INSIDE ITS HEAD

     Gears turn, illuminated by the beam of the light.  The gears
     part slowly to reveal a small writhing INSECT screwed to a
     metal plate.

     MAN 2 shows the puppet PHOTOGRAPHS:  WHITE as he looks
     currently, shots of him as a teenager, a young boy, a baby.
     Photos of what we realise are his parents, standing on a
     seaside pier sirtiling and waving.  Where he went to school.  A
     red push-bike he owned as a boy.  His first sweetheart.  Then a
     photo of a young woman smiling  -  his WIFE.

     MAN 3 holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the
     puppet creature  -  MORE SOUNDS OF SURF...

     A FIGURE clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows.
     His pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane  -  a
     carved silver insect.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Man 3 steps up to
     him.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You have duplicated the personality,
               yes.

                         MAN 3
               It is ready.  The Doctor was most
               helpful.

     Mister Black turns towards the OTHER MEN.

                         MISTER BLACK
               I hear a clock in my head, and I like
               it!

                         MEN  (respond in unison)
               We hear clocks in our heads, and we
               like it!

                         MISTER BLACK
               A world in our likeness!

                         MEN
               A world in our likeness!

     The Men close the hatch in the top of the puppet's head.
     SQUEAK...  CLUNK!  The puppet tests out its MANY WEAPONS, a
     series of nasty-looking blades snap out of its small body, then
     retract.


     INT.  INSPECTOR'S APARTMENT

     Bumstead leads White through the front door, into a SITTING
     ROOM.  Everything is extremely neat and organized, plastic
     coverings on all the furniture.  White steps towards a sofa.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Please.  Not that way.  If you could
               just follow the covering  -  the
               carpet gets stained and it's
               impossible to clean.

     White stops. Bumstead indicates a CLEAR PLASTIC MAT running
     through the room.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Everything the department knows about
               John White is in this.  Here.
                    (hands file)
               Excuse me for a moment.

     White flips through it.  Details of White's history.

     IN THE BEDROOM

     Bumstead removes an empty suitcase from a closet.  Begins to
     place neatly folded clothes within it.

                         BUMSTEAD (calling to White)
               Age thirty one.  Brown hair.  Green
               eyes.  Five feet, ten and a half
               inches tall.  Until recently worked
               for a firm manufacturing scientific
               equipment.  Wife's name  -  Elizabeth.
               Father and mother  -  Harold and
               Edith.  Both dead.  A history of
               mental instability...  etcetera,
               etcetera.

     Bumstead walks back into the sitting room, packed bag in hand.
     He looks at White leafing through the file.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That stuff helpful?

                         WHITE  (disappointed)
               I suppose...
                    (looks up)
               Why are you helping me?

                         BUMSTEAD
               You're case has been driving me
               crazy.  You see, I pride myself on
               being thorough.  There's too many
               loose ends with your case.
                    (a beat)
               Thought it was best you were hidden
               until we understand more about the
               facts.  What do you know about these
               men in black?

     White looks up, pauses as if he didn't understand Bumstead,
     then:

                         WHITE
               If you shoot them here...
                    (points at his
                    forehead)
               you can kill them.  They're not
               people  -  like us  -  got insects in
               their heads...  Got any disinfectant?

     The inspector is caught off-guard by the question.

                         WHITE  (continues)
               It's my legs.  Been bitten.  Giving
               me trouble.

     Bumstead walks silently to the bathroom, opens a medicine
     cabinet.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to himself)
               Insects?

     He returns clutching a small bottle and some cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Here.
                    (hands things to
                    White)
               Careful with your trousers.  That
               stuff stains.

     The inspector gives white back his revolver and his wallet.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Here.

     Bumstead paces thoughtfully, careful to stay on the plastic
     protective covering.  He turns, glares at White, who dabs his
     legs with the cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Any idea what part the Doctor plays
               in this business?

     White shakes head.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Let's try and find out, shall we.
                    (points at White's
                    shoe)
               Lace is untied.

     White looks down.  Bumstead doesn't lie.


     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     The BARBER is shaving under the armpit of a client.  GRANDPA
     snores in a corner, his feet buried under a pile of hair
     clippings..

     The BELL hanging above the door rings.  The door swings open.

                         BARBER
               He with you shortly, sir...

     Several heads turn, THEN LOOK DOWN to see the PUPPET.  The
     puppet wheels forward and stops.

                         BARBER (not really looking)
               Hello, sonny.  Cute outfit.  Mother
               get it for you?

     The puppet crosses the room threateningly.  TWO OTHER CLIENTS
     look up startled from their newspapers and girly magazines.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  it wheels up to the barber's leg and GRABS HIS
     TROUSER with a mechanical claw.  The puppet holds out a PHOTO
     OF White.

                         PUPPET (incoherent obscenities)
               EEEEEEEEK...  AHHHHHHH!...
               SHHHHIIIITTTT!...  FUUUUCKER!!

                         BARBER (looks down, scared now)
               Huh?

     He's grabbed and THROWN into a nearby chair.  The puppet leaps
     onto the bench in front of him  -  he's frightened, so are the
     customers.

     Puppet wheels up and down on the bench in front of the
     customers  -  stopping to glance at individuals in a threatening
     manner, holding out the photo of white.

     It leans forward, spinning its blades  -  HAIR FLIES.  Screams
     o.s.

     The PUPPET retracts its weapons  -  COVERED in blood.  It
     wheels forward, through the door and into the street.

     THE CAMERA PANS to reveal a scene of complete carnage.  Blood
     covers the walls.  FOUR BODIES slumped about the room.  Each has
     an outlandish hairstyle.


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White looks at the inspector  -  street lights pass over his
     features.  Bumstead stares at the road.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I didn't tell you the entire reason I
               helped you.  It started with two
               little girls.  Twins.  Used to play
               with them when I was young.  Couldn't
               remember for the life of me what they
               looked like, then I understood why...

     He looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint.

                         BUMSTEAD
               They didn't have faces.

                         WHITE
               What?

                         BUMSTEAD
               That's right.  Just seamless flesh
               across the front of their heads.  No
               mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it
               that way.  Up until then they had
               been normal little girls in my
               memory.
                    (looks back at White)
               That's not all.  Once I started
               examining them, all sorts of things
               about my life, had...
               inconsistencies.  It was like a game.
               I would think about a person or a
               place, or an event.  Then I would
               turn the lights off.  Sit down in a
               comfortable chair...  And study each
               detail of this subject.

     He glances at White, then back to the road.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Everything was liquid beneath a thin
               surface that had always seemed solid
               to me...

     Bumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Is there anything you haven't told me
               about this business?  Even the most
               insignificant thing?

                         WHITE (thinking)
               No.  Nothing I can think of.
               Except...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Go on.

                         WHITE
               Well.  The only thing I've been
               certain of, all this time, is that I
               need to get to the ocean.  The point
               is no one seems to know how to get
               there.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...

     He trails off.  Shakes his head slowly.

                         BUMSTEAD
               We'll get to the bottom of this.  I
               mean it.


     INT.  SCHREBER'S SURGERY

     The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open
     suddenly.  White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the
     doctor before he can protest.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I met a friend of yours the other
               night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No
               hair.  Rather pale skin...

                         SCHREBER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That's surprising.  He was leaving
               your office at the time...

                         SCHREBER
               You are mistaken.

                         WHITE
               What are you hiding?

                         SCHREBER
               Nothing.  I don't know anything!

     BUMSTEAD removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face.

                         SCHREBER
               Please, they'll kill me...

                         BUMSTEAD
               I think it's time you introduced us
               to your little friends.


     EXT.  ALLEY  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an
     alleyway.

     Schreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall.

                         SCHREBER
               In there.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Just like that?

     The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall.

     Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the
     foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.  He
     unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.  He
     waves the other men forward.

     White and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the
     mat  -  it says:  WELCOME on it.

     A CORRIDOR

     Through the door  -  AN ELEVATOR.  There is only a down button.
     Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open.

     They step inside.  The doors close, the lift descends.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is this place?

                         SCHREBER
               You wouldn't believe me if I told
               you, Inspector.  Have patience  -
               you'll see for yourself.

     When the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK
     PASSAGEWAY.


     EXT.  LIBRARY  -  NIGHT

     The PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base
     of the building.  It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps
     repeatedly.  It looks down and shrieks with a string of
     mechanical obscenities.


     INT.  MYSTERY MEN'S UNDERWORLD

     WHITE and BUMSTEAD follow SCHREBER down a corridor to what
     appears to be an ancient crypt.  They enter a door  -  it has
     something written on it in a strange language.

     INSIDE IS A ROOM

     They stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light
     switch, suddenly White STOPS dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead
     turns to him.

                         WHITE
               Look.

     White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks.  On
     these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats -  that's not all.  Each hook
     carries A FACE.

     Bumstead and White step closer, look at the faces.  They seem to
     be elaborate, very life-like MASKS.

                         SCHREBER
               Put them on.

     White and the inspector look at each other, incredulous.

     OUTSIDE  -  THE CORRIDOR

     The door opens.  White, Bumstead and Schreber step out, wearing
     poorly fitting masks and coats  -  DISGUISED AS MYSTERY MEN.

     FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR

     The three men come across a small area with a raised platform,
     between arches.  A number of OPEN CARTS roll past on tracks  -
     the scene resembles some bizarre amusement-park ride.  The carts
     are numbered on the side  -  all of them empty.

                         SCHREBER
               Get in.  Hurry.

     White, Bumstead and Schreber hop aboard.  The cart takes them
     into a DARK TUNNEL, deeper into the secret underworld of the
     MYSTERY MEN.  They MOVE THROUGH a subterranean landscape of
     unexplained contraptions and bones.

                         WHITE
                    (to Bumstead)
               Where do you think this goes?

                         BUMSTEAD
               It sure isn't the fun-fair.

     The cart finally comes to a stop in a cave.  Bumstead, White and
     Schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway, as a LONG LINE OF
     MYSTERY MEN walk past them.

                         SCHREBER
               Follow me, and do exactly as I do.

     They join the end of the line, falling into step.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER

     The MEN, with WHITE, BUMSTEAD and SCHREBER in tow, enter and
     sit in a number of rows of wooden chairs.  White and the
     inspector do the same.

     MORE MYSTERY MEN appear in circular portals high up on the
     concrete walls.  ONE MAN faces the others at the front of the
     room.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1
               Eleven past eleven  -  the Night of the
               Eye.

     The seated Men start to CHANT.

                         MEN
               NIGHT OF THE EYE!  NIGHT OF THE EYE!

     A MAN in the front row stands.

                         MAN 2
               The Eye is too small for the head of
               the pin!

                         MAN 1
               Yes!

     ANOTHER MAN stands.  Next to the first, who sits again.

                         MAN 3
               What is it that floats on the water?
               The Eye!

                         MAN 1
               Indeed!

     So it goes around the room, each Man takes his turn announcing
     part of the strange ritual.  It will be White, Bumstead and
     Schreber's turn shortly.  White is worried, looks at the
     others.

                         WHITE (whisper)
               What do we do?

                         SCHREBER (hisses back)
               Fake it!

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?

     SCHREBER is next  -  he stands abruptly.

                         SCHREBER
               The eye.  Master of time and space!

     Then it's Bumstead's turn.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The Eye  -  um  -  delicious with
               horseradish on rye!

     MAN 1 at the front seems confused for a moment  -  SEVERAL of
     the others turn towards Bumstead.

                         MAN 1 (uncertain)
               Good.

     The inspector sits back down  -  whispers to White without
     looking at him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Nothing to it...

     White stands.  Hesitates.  Then:

                         WHITE
               Eye...  eye, captain!

     White sits down, shaking his head, embarrassed.

                         MAN 1
               Um  -  yes...

     THE MAN NEXT TO WHITE rises up  -  keeps rising, FLOATS IN THE
     AIR above the Men's heads.

                         MAN 4
               My spine will bend for the Eye!

     He turns sideways, still floating.


     EXT.  ALLEY

     BACK ABOVE GROUND, Bumstead, White and Schreber run from the
     door at the end of the alley-way, tossing their masks away.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Was that for real down there?

                         SCHREBER
               I'm afraid so.

     The inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him
     back.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What the hell is that?

     At the end of the alley the PUPPET advances menacingly.
     Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and
     disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Quick.  My car.

     Fortunately BUMSTEAD'S CAR stands nearby.  The two men leap in,
     start it up.  Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the
     glare of the headlights.

     The puppet's head opens, a TINY PROPELLER pops out, spins,
     lifting the puppet into the air.  The car passes beneath it at
     speed.  Screeches off into a street, races along between tall
     buildings.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE
               What now?

                         BUMSTEAD
               This ocean business...  I know where
               I can find a map.  I need to go back
               to the station.  Where will you be?

     White thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him
     from his pocket.

                         WHITE
               I'll go see an uncle of mine.
                    (reading)
               Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double
               six  -  three...

     Bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with
     the wheel, driving at breakneck speed.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good.
                    (looks in rear
                    mirror)
               Uh-oh...

     White turns and looks behind them.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  HEADLIGHTS gaining on them.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  sitting AT THE WHEEL of a stolen car, driving
     like crazy.

     BACK IN BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White takes out his gun  -  AIMS at the rapidly approaching
     car.

                         WHITE  (remembers)
               It's empty.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Take mine.

     Bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat.  They swap.

     The puppet PULLS ALONGSIDE, a mechanical arm extends towards
     Bumstead's front tire.  A SPINNING BLADE extends from the end
     of the mechanical arm.

                         PUPPET
               ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...  HA-HA-HA-HA-
               HA!!

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel.  White
     fires.  Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows.

     THE BLADE cuts into the tire  -  it pops loudly, goes flat,
     metal SPARKS off the road.

     White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash.  Bumstead
     fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other
     vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans
     flying.

     The PUPPET'S car falls behind  -  then swerves off into a side-
     street and disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks behind him)
               Where did it go?

                         WHITE  (looks back also)
               Don't know.

     Both look FORWARD AGAIN  -  to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in
     front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY.  Bumstead's car is going too
     fast.  Slams the brakes.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET  -  Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car
     approaches like a bullet.

     INSIDE INSPECTOR'S CAR

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jump!

     Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad.  The two men LEAP.

     The car continues onwards.

     CRASH!  KA-BOOM!

     In the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves
     up from different sides of the street.  Look at each other,
     turn and head in OPPOSITE directions.

     CAMERA MOVES IN on mangled metal  -  a MECHANICAL CLAW starts
     to pull itself from the wreckage.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps up to a SMALL DOOR in the side of a building.  A
     sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with
     fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface.  Dominating
     everything is a GREEN MAN with scales  -  a KING NEPTUNE-type.

     INSIDE

     White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue
     curtain.  In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth
     hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window.  The
     man wakes with a start.

                         TICKET SELLER
               Yeah.  That's what I said!
                    (looks at White  -
                    rubs head)
               What..?

                         WHITE
               I'm looking for this address.

     The man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily.

                         TICKET SELLER
               Upstairs.  Through there.

     He thumbs the blue curtain.  Curls up, shuts his eyes again.

     BEYOND THE CURTAIN

     A dark room full of BUBBLING NOISES AND WATER DRIPPING  -  an
     aquarium.

     Several corridors meander between large glass panels that look
     into illuminated tanks of sea creatures.

     White moves past a shadowy doorway.  He can barely make out
     STAIRS.


     INT.  HALL-WAY

     White moves cautiously in the darkness.  On a door a tiny
     NAMEPLATE says:  K. WHITE.  The door is unlocked.  He opens it
     and goes in.

     INSIDE

     An entrance hall of an apartment.  A large number of MOUNTED
     FISH of all sizes line the hall.

     PHOTOS on the wall  -  family portraits.  White examines these,
     concentrates on one in particular  -  a young boy on a red push-
     bike, in the background a sign with a faded image of a girl in
     a bathing suit:  WELCOME TO BLUMBVILLE!  it says.

     A strange WHIRRING NOISE O.S.  White hides behind a sofa.
     Whatever is making the whirring noise moves past slowly.  White
     cannot see what it is.

                         VOICE O.S.
               John?

     White turns to see an OLD MAN in his pyjamas sitting in a
     WHEELCHAIR.  The man pushes a lever on the side of the chair.  A
     whir of electric motors.  The chair carries him out of the
     shadows.  White steps from behind the sofa.

                         MAN
               Are you alright?  What are you doing
               here?  Is this one of your jokes,
               John?  It's been so long, I thought
               you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?

                         WHITE
               Uncle...  Karl.


     INT.  AIR-CONDITION DUCT

     A P.O.V.  -  MOVING THROUGH a dark, claustrophobic pipe.
     TWISTING around tight corners, DARTING down straight lengths of
     ducting.  Dim light spills from wire grills spaced along the
     walls.

     WE TRAVEL up to one grill, at the end of a long stretch of
     tunnel  -  stop, nowhere left to go. We can see through the gaps
     in the wire, looking down into...

     THE ROOM

     White and uncle Karl are having a SLIDE-SHOW.  Shots of a recent
     vacation  -  the uncle doing a series of mundane things.

                         KARL (chuckling)
               Not often I get a chance to show
               these.

     He changes the slide:  an image of him standing against a brick
     wall.

                         KARL
               And this is me again about  -  um  -  I
               would guess about twelve feet further
               to the right of the last shot.  Now
               just behind the wall is the hotel I
               stayed at  -  sweet little place...

     The PHONE RINGS.  Uncle Karl wheels over, picks up the receiver.

                         KARL (talks down the line)
               Hello...  Yes, he's here...
                    (holds out the phone
                    to White)
               It's for you.

     White concerned  -  takes the phone.

                         WHITE
               Yes?
                    (he listens)
               Oh, it's you...  Yes...  My uncle
               apparently...  Just looking at some
               memories...  You have?  That's good.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     Bumstead talks to White on the phone.  He stands in a dark
     room, surrounded by charts and maps.

                         BUMSTEAD
               At first I thought there was no way
               to get to the ocean...  The buildings
               are a barrier, no windows, no doors
               -  everything just, well, ends  -  only
               thing would be drill a hole.  But
               then, I saw it, one door, just one...
               Inside a tenement building...

     Bumstead is interrupted by a NOISE O.S.  He looks to a frosted
     partition  -  dark figures walk past on the other side.  He
     quickly sorts through SEVERAL MAPS, making as little noise as
     he can.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)
               We can meet later  -  but first I
               have to do something.  Look I got to
               go...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     White holds THE PHONE, listens to Bumstead on the other end.

                         WHITE
               Where can we meet?...  Alright.
               Good...

     As White hangs up he notices A DOOR behind a big old crockery
     cupboard.  The cupboard has been pushed up against the wall,
     hiding the door.

     BACK IN THE POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD quickly folds the map and shoves it into his pocket.
     As he turns and runs from the room we NOTICE A DARK FIGURE
     standing behind a shelf in the room.

     IN UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     UNCLE KARL continues to change slides  -  the noise echoing
     about the room.  White moves over and sits down next to him.

                         KARL
               Look!  This is a good one!

                         WHITE
               What is that door?

                         KARL
               Which one?

                         WHITE
               There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where
               does it go?

     The uncle watches the slides.

                         KARL
               Such a joker!  Like your father.

                         WHITE
               No.  Have a look.

     He leads the old man over to the cabinet.

                         WHITE
               You see it?

                         KARL
               Yes.

                         WHITE
               Where does it lead?

                         KARL
               It must be a closet or something.

     White pushes at the cabinet.  The old man helps.  They only
     manage to push several inches  -  it is very heavy.  White
     decides to just climb over it.  He squeezes through, opens the
     door and climbs a set of dark stairs.  Uncle Karl watches.

                         KARL
               Don't trip over.  It's dark up there.


     INT.  ATTIC  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a light switch  -  it is flipped.

     AN ATTIC  -  full of books, boxes, discarded possessions.
     White picks up a book and opens it  -  the pages have been
     eaten out by a swarm of ROACHES.  He drops it in disgust as the
     insects scurry over his hands.

     In a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great
     interest.  At the bottom of the box he finds a SMALL DOG-EARED
     DRAWING BOOK.  On the cover is a colourful scrawl in child's
     writing  -  a title:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     White sits down and flips through the book in the dim light.
     Page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings.
     As he reads segments from the book he seems more and more
     disturbed.  He flips through faster and faster.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Pages flip past, stopping occasionally.  Glimpses of DIAGRAMS.
     The MYSTERY MEN and THEIR WORLD.  Cross-sections of the MYSTERY
     MEN, the cavity in their head with the INSECTS INSIDE clearly
     illustrated.  EVERYTHING.

     PUSH IN CLOSE on White.  He looks up, STUNNED.


     INT.  UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     White emerges from the attic, clutching the small book to his
     chest, lost in thought.  He steps quietly into a hall-way  -
     notices the old man putting THE PHONE back on its cradle.

                         KARL
               John, I didn't see you there.

     A NOISE O.S. White and Uncle Karl turn.  A VENTILATION GRILL
     falls off a wall, revealing a hole.  EYES shine from the
     darkness.

     THE PUPPET leaps from the hole.  Its blades unfolding,
     spinning wildly before it hits the carpet.  It faces the two
     men.

                         KARL
               What is that?

                         WHITE (to Karl)
               Get back!

                         KARL
               Filthy beast!  Shoo!  Go on!  Shoo!

     He wheels forward, attempting to scare the puppet off.

                         WHITE
               No!

     The puppet goes for Uncle Karl.  A whirr of metal, BLOOD
     SPLASHES ACROSS WHITE and the walls.  Uncle Karl SCREAMS
     horribly.

     White grabs a chair  -  holds it above him.  The puppet turns
     from the dead man in the wheelchair.  White lets it have it.
     The chair CRASHES DOWN, splintering into pieces.

     The puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers.  White has a
     fire-poker now.  As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting
     with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall.
     White runs out the door.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     He leaps into a waiting elevator.  Pushes the top floor button.

     THE ELEVATOR SHAFT  -  The elevator moves upwards.

     INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     White looks through the circular window in the door.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  Floor after floor SLIDES PAST  -  deserted.  He
     looks at the floor indicator.  TIGHT ON NUMBERS lighting up:
     86, 87, 88...

     Then the elevator stops, the doors open, looking down a dark
     corridor.  The PUPPET is at the end.  It turns to face him,
     SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD, a horrible high-pitched shriek from its
     mechanical voice box.

     White STABS the buttons of the elevator frantically, the doors
     won't close.  The puppet is upon him.  He JUMPS, straight up.
     It goes under him, CRASHING INTO the back of the elevator.
     White hits the down button one last time, and leaps out of the
     compartment AS THE DOORS CLOSE.

     A MECHANICAL extendible arm shoots out and grabs White around
     the ankle. DRAGS him across floor.  THE PUPPET shrieks wildly
     again, as...

     ITS ARM  -  is JAMMED in the closing doors now.  Lift descends.
     The puppet squeals.  The arm SNAPS OFF.

     White stands, pulls dislocated arm off his ankle.  He can hear
     the elevator descending.  Suddenly it STOPS  -  starts
     returning to his floor.  White turns and runs again.

     The lift doors BURST OPEN  -  the ENRAGED CREATURE emerges and
     races after him.

     He tears around a corner  -  finds himself in a dead-end.
     Nowhere to go.  He can hear the puppet approaching along the
     corridor.  Suddenly he notice A GRILL on a wall ABOVE HIS HEAD.
     He pulls it off, climbs into an incredibly tight pipe.  Crawls
     frantically.

     He sees a LIGHT ahead.  An opening.  He kicks the grill off.  A
     sudden gust of wind.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The pipe leads to the outside of the building  -  nowhere to go
     except a hundred stories STRAIGHT DOWN.  He screams, almost
     falls.  Turns to start crawling back.

     Suddenly the end of the pipe fills with WHIRRING METAL BLADES.
     The puppet has followed him in and is advancing.

     No choice  -  he looks out the hole.  SEES A PIPE on the
     outside of the building, running vertically near the opening.
     It looks impossible but it's his only chance.

     He climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening,
     REACHES for the pipe.  The puppet is almost upon him.  He
     swings across, gets a HAND on the pipe.  He slips, DANGLES  -
     holding on  -  one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole.
     The pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it.

     SUDDENLY he hears a MECHANICAL CLICKING  -  TURNS to see the
     puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand.
     A soft noise reverberates in its voice box  -  a mechanical
     giggle?  A circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves
     down onto White's HAND.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYES  -  sweat beads and runs down his forehead.

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE  -  as it cuts into flesh.  BLOOD spatters
     White's face as he grimaces with intense pain.  He can't hold
     on.

     HE FALLS, plummets through space.  Screaming.


     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     A GROUP OF SURGEONS stand about BUMSTEAD'S MOTHER on her life-
     support machinery.  The surgeons have face-masks on and are in
     deep shadow.  The woman stares blankly, still in a coma.

     IN THE RECEPTION AREA

     BUMSTEAD looks up from his wristwatch.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I can't wait any longer...

     He is standing in front of the MALE NURSE in the glassed-in
     counter.

                         NURSE
               I'm sorry.  I told you, she is being
               examined...

     He turns and storms off down the corridor.  The NURSE stands,
     shouting after him.

                         NURSE
               Mister Bumstead!

     INSIDE MOTHER'S ROOM

     One of the "doctors" leans down and grabs a handful of WIRES
     leading out of a box beside the woman.

                         SURGEON
               We will teach the pig to meddle in
               our affairs.  Yes.

     He pulls the wires out in a burst of electrical sparks  -  ALL
     THE MACHINES DIE.  The woman comes to life momentarily, starts
     to claw at the glass shield in front of her face, like she is
     suffocating.  The life drains from her weak body and she is
     STILL.

     ANGLE ON THE DOOR  -  it bursts open.  Bumstead is standing
     there.  The masked surgeons are startled, they turn rapidly to
     face him.

                         BUMSTEAD (steps forward)
               What is happening?

                         SURGEON
               Ah, Inspector Bumstead!  We are glad
               you are here  -  I'm afraid we have
               done all we can.  Yes.  Your Mother
               has passed.  Yes.

     Bumstead turns towards his mother.

                         BUMSTEAD
               But she was getting better...

                         SURGEON
               We are sorry.  The cancer  -  it was
               fatal.

     Bumstead turns to the men, confusion in his eyes.

                         BUMSTEAD
               She doesn't have cancer.

     The men glance at each other for a moment, then back at the
     inspector.

                         SURGEON
               We knew that.  Yes.
                    (the other men nod)
               Anyway  -  she is dead.

     Bumstead leaps forward, RIPS OFF one of the surgeon's masks.

     ANGLE ON THE MAN  -  He turns to look at Bumstead, pale skin,
     staring eyes, a MYSTERY MAN.  TWO OTHER MEN grab him from
     behind.

                         BUMSTEAD (struggles)
               I'll kill you all!

     One of the Mystery Men steps up to the struggling inspector,
     places the palm of his hand across Bumstead's eyes.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You will obey us, yes.  In your mind
               there is a dark space...

     TIGHT ANGLE

     Bumstead's hand reaches out, fumbles at a tray of surgical
     implements, grabs a SCALPEL.

     WIDER

     He cuts into the hand of one of the Men holding him, SPINS AND
     DRIVES the scalpel into the forehead of the Mystery Man
     attempting to hypnotise him.

     The other Men leap towards him.


     EXT.  CANAL  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE

     His eyes are shut tight.  He opens them, slowly LOOKS AROUND,
     curious why he isn't dead.

     WIDER ANGLE

     White floats in MID-AIR, hovering ten feet or so above a dark
     body of water.  He looks amazed.  Shuts his eyes, rubs them,
     opens them again.  Still floating.

     He clenches his fists and TENSES his body.  Slowly he starts to
     MOVE FORWARD, hovering at an even height over the water.

     WIDER STILL

     SEVERAL ANGLES feature the figure of White levitating across
     the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  He comes to a stop.  Smiles in amazement.
     Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has
     opened beneath him.

     ANGLE ON BUBBLES floating to the surface.  White's FACE rises
     slowly out of the water.

     WIDER  -  CITY SKYLINE

     A SMALL OBJECT floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny
     white parachute.

     BACK ON WHITE

     He swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself
     silently through the still canals of the city.


     EXT.  HARBOUR

     Oil tankers move silently through inky water.

     White paddles the boat to the bottom of A PIER, climbs a rotten
     ladder.  He runs off into the shadows.

     BACK IN THE WATER

     The PUPPET cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear
     propeller.  It reaches the pier, climbs to the top.  The prop
     retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a
     concrete surface.  It looks around  -  it knows White is there
     somewhere.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     A trail of WET FOOTPRINTS on the ground.  It follows them, is
     led to a crane cabin.

     INSIDE THE CRANE'S CABIN  -  is White, a lunatic grin on his
     face, at the controls.

     A NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.  It looks up.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     Follows the crane up into the air.  The crane is swinging around
     against the dark sky.  A HUGE METAL CONTAINER dangles, stops
     above the puppet.

     ON WHITE

                         WHITE
               Nice knowing you.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S HAND  -  It pulls a lever.

     THE CONTAINER  -  Shakes and starts to fall.

     THE PUPPET  -  Screams up at the plummeting container.

     WIDER

     The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature.

     Silence.  Dust floats in the air.


     EXT.  STREET

     BUMSTEAD's running.  He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash
     in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn  -  but he made it
     out alive...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOF-TOP

     BUMSTEAD sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing
     heavily  -  he's losing a lot of blood.

     He waits.

     A NOISE O.S. startles him  -  A FIGURE in the shadows across the
     roof.

                         BUMSTEAD
               White?

     It's too big to be White.  The man steps from the shadows.

                         STROMBOLI (walking forward)
               Hello, Bumstead.

     He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector.  Bumstead lies
     bleeding, against the wall.  He points his own gun at the
     advancing man and pulls the trigger.

     CLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit.

     Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away,
     picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall.  Without
     Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why do you always have to find things
               out the hard way!  Couldn't you just
               do your job, you idiot?  I told you,
               didn't I?  These people are not
               playing games, Bumstead.  They can do
               anything they want, don't you
               understand?

                         BUMSTEAD (a hiss)
               You're one of them.  You bastard...

                         STROMBOLI (laughing)
               In a way, we all are, inspector!
               You.  Me.  Everybody!

     Stromboli carries Bumstead towards the EDGE of the roof.  He
     keeps laughing.

                         STROMBOLI
               Time for that early retirement,
               Bumstead.  Didn't bring the gold watch
               I'm afraid.

                         BUMSTEAD (weakly)
               No...  Please...

     INSPECTOR'S P.O.V.

     THE EDGE looms up  -  a long drop to the street.


     EXT.  STREET

     White paces nervously through empty streets.  He stops, to get
     his bearings, then turns and runs into:

     A SILHOUETTED FIGURE in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels.
     A skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm.  An inhuman
     moan.

     Terrorised, White pulls back.

                         FIGURE
               Ahhh...  it hurts!...

     The mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall.  A
     streetlight reveals...

     DOCTOR SCHREBER covered in blood, encased in a metal framework
     covered in silver blades.

                         WHITE
               What happened to you?

                         SCHREBER
               I'm...  being...  punished.

     The blades are connected to the wheels  -  they turn when he
     moves forward, metal cuts into his flesh, slowly SKINNING HIM
     ALIVE.  A torture machine.  Between screams of intense pain, the
     doctor speaks.

                         SCHREBER
               I had to  -  ahhhh  -  find you...  I..
               I...

     The doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his
     face.
                         WHITE
               What is it?

                         SCHREBER
               We are...  living in their dreams...

     Schreber turns and rolls off into the night, screaming  -  BLADES
     SPIN furiously, peeling back flesh.  He glances at White one
     last time.

                         SCHREBER
               Insect...  dreams...


     EXT.  STREET

     WHITE is running.  As he approaches the building he hears a
     scream  -  looks up to see a figure PLUNGE OFF the roof.

     He runs over.  Looks down at the twisted body.  THE INSPECTOR
     moans  -  barely alive.  White kneels by his side.

     BUMSTEAD'S hand moves across to an expanding POOL of red beside
     him, traces an 'H' on the ground in the blood.

                         WHITE (reading)
               Aitch?

     The inspector seems to be dying, then revives momentarily, puts
     A MAP in white's hand, looks up at him:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Gesundheit!

     His eyes roll up and he GOES LIMP.  White stares at the body,
     then:

                         WHITE
               I didn't sneeze.


     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     The MORTICIAN turns off the lights in the main hall and steps
     into his office, sits down, pours himself a hot drink; turns on
     the radio, opens his conic-book.

     A NOISE O.S. disturbs him and he gets up, walks out of his
     office, looks into the darkness.

     HIS P.O.V. PANS around the empty morgue.  Nothing.  Decides to go
     back to his office.  He turns and is startled by three MYSTERY
     MEN obstructing his path.

                         MAN 1
               We are looking for the White victims.

                         MORTICIAN
               And who the hell are you?

     The mortician catches a glimpse of the shiny dagger Man 1 is
     clutching by his side.  He becomes very scared.

                         MORTICIAN
               Over there.  Numbers eight to twelve.

     THREE MEN look over to where the mortician has pointed in
     unison.  Man 1 looks back.

                         MAN 1
               Thank you.

     A FLASH OF STEEL.  The mortician's throat SPOUTS blood.  He grabs
     reflexively at the gash and falls back onto the floor, DEAD
     before he hits the tiles.

     The Mystery Men step to an adjoining chamber.  Man 2 puts down a
     Box he is carrying, opens the lid.  A green glow oozes out.  The
     other Men manipulate levers on a control panel on a nearby
     wall.  Stainless steel doors open.  Body-length trays slide into
     the dim light.  SHAPES covered in white sheets.

     Man 2 with the box removes a GLASS SYRINGE, filled with a
     glowing green liquid.  He steps TO THE BODIES and injects each
     with the syringe, through the sheets.  When he has finished he
     steps back, places the syringe back in the box.  The MEN leave
     silently.

     All is silent and still.

     Then the shape beneath a sheet starts to SIT UP.  Then another,
     and another.


     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     WHITE is running again, clutching BUMSTEAD'S MAP.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP

     REVEALS the entire corridor.  KEEPS PULLING BACK  -  until the
     view is impossibly wide  -  like a cross-section of the building
     he's in, a doll's house with the roof taken off.  The TINY
     FIGURE runs, amidst a dark network of surrounding rooms and
     passages.

     CONTINUE PULL BACK

     White is no more than a SPECK  -  the hall-way stretches
     ENDLESSLY in both directions, behind and in front of the moving
     figure, through an infinite labyrinth.

     WIDER STILL

     We no longer make out the figure.  The x-rayed environment
     resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city  -  the
     corridor an ever increasing SPIRAL.


     INT.  ORNATE APARTMENT BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     White reaches the top of a spiral flight of stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     APARTMENT 'H'  -  a rusted metal letter on the door.  White steps
     forward.  He knocks once and the door creaks open, unlocked.

     INSIDE

     The rooms are empty, derelict, strewn with rubbish.  Mould grows
     on the damp walls.  A door stands at the end of a long empty
     room.  He can hear the muffled sounds of SURF, SEAGULLS.  White
     starts to walk forward, smiling.  As he approaches the door he
     begins to feel colder.

     He opens the door and looks out.  A blast of SUNLIGHT  -  blue
     ocean and sky.

                         VOICE O.S.
               John White...

     White does not turn about, he takes a step forward, then
     another  - and RUNS INTO THE SKY  - A PAINTED WALL. He glances up
     at a small SPEAKER built into the wall  -  the SOURCE of the sea-
     side SOUND EFFECTS.

     He hears the click of the gun being cocked behind him.  Hopes
     dashed, he turns.  ANGLE ON A MYSTERY MAN  -  a gun pointed at
     White's stomach.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               There is nothing, Mister White.
               Beyond the city.  Never has been.
               Unfortunate.  Yes?

     White is led into a pitch black room.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE  -  In the darkness  -  he looks across to
     the Mystery Man standing beside him.

                         WHITE
               How did you know where to find me?

                         MYSTERY MAN
               We knew you would turn up here
               eventually...  Been waiting for you,
               yes.  Hoped you wouldn't make a
               nuisance of yourself on the way...

     The Man motions with the gun for White to walk forward.  As soon
     as White turns to do this, the Man slips from the room and
     shuts the door, cutting off any existing light.

     A NOISE O.S.  -  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights
     start to come up all over the room.

     It's a normal, average-sized, living room.  All the furniture
     has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums  -  an
     arrangement resembling an IMPROVISED COURT of law.  In fact,
     White realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box.

     The apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a
     door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the
     kitchen) and a series of figures step through.  MYSTERY MEN.

     All the MEN take up specific positions around the room, without
     uttering a word, but don't sit.  One MYSTERY MAN opens a curtain
     beneath an arched entrance  -  beyond it, within a very small
     room, stand DOZENS OF PEOPLE, crammed shoulder to shoulder.  The
     people stare at White silently  -  a bizarre gallery of
     spectators.

     An eerie silence falls on the room.

     The kitchen door opens again.  White is shocked to see the
     VICTIMS WALK INTO the room and adopt positions in what is
     obviously the area for the jury.

     The DISEMBOWELED CORPSE OF A WOMAN steps out of the shadows,
     pushing a pram.  Her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white
     sheet.

     Within the pram is the BABY clutching its own head, with spine
     attached, under its arm.

     Then the mutilated FREDRICK hops out, followed by the three
     brown blood-stained paper parcels containing what is left of
     the YOUNG BOY.

     Finally, his WIFE and the JAPANESE WOMAN, still in passionate
     embrace, take their positions.

     Another door opens  -  a closet. Within stands the figure we have
     only seen as a shadow  -  the elderly MYSTERY MAN with the cane.
     MISTER BLACK slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain
     hanging from the ceiling  -  the light snaps on inside the
     closet.  Somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a
     toilet is heard flushing.

     He is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority
     as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting
     his withered body on his cane.  Looks like he will play JUDGE.

     Everyone in the room now sits.  Mister Black looks at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear,
     but cold.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Welcome.

     White just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook
     called:  ANSWERS.

                         MISTER BLACK
               John White, you are to be tried for
               murder, yes.  You wish to confess to
               these crimes now?

     White is silent.  He leans over and scratches his legs through
     the fabric of his trousers.  They itch like crazy.

     Mister Black turns to the assembled people.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Very well.  The testimony of the
               prosecutors.  Yes.

     TWO MYSTERY MEN stand and step across to a wooden easel.  MAN 1
     stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc.
     drawn on stiff cardboard.  MAN 2 uses a pointer while he
     describes the evidence to support their case.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               We will show that John White is
               abnormal, a menace to society, a
               dangerous sick individual, and that
               the court should have no mercy in
               finding him guilty and punishable to
               the extreme for his crimes.

     MAN 1 places a large black and white photo blow-up on the
     easel.  It shows White at the door of the JAPANESE WOMAN'S
     apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1
               Exhibit A shows the accused leaving
               the scene of his most recent crime,
               yes.  A photo taken by a remote camera
               planted by one of our agents.

     White watches in stunned silence.

     A general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is
     made.  Mister Black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               Exhibit B...

     MAN 1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to MAN 2.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               Actual tape recording of accused
               committing aforementioned crime, yes.

     He turns a switch, the reels spin slowly.  A hush fills the
     room.

                         VOICE 1 (sounds like JAPANESE WOMAN)
               No...  Please...

     A scream.

                         VOICE 2 (sounds like White)
               Shut up!

     Another scream.  A ripping sound.

                         VOICE 3 (sounds like his WIFE)
               John!  Don't...

     Another scream.

     White is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this
     any longer.

                         WHITE (a squeak, almost inaudible)
               Stop it!  This is a lie...

     Mister Black turns to White.  The Men testifying stop the tape
     and look at him also.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Something to say?  Ready to confess?

     The Men in the audience turn and all stare at White, as do the
     victims and the spectators in the adjoining room.

                         WHITE (back to a whisper)
               I didn't kill anyone.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Speak up.  Yes.

                         WHITE (finds his voice)
               It's lies.  Everything.

     He grips the barrier before him.

     A SHRIEK from the pram containing the BABY  -  it rocks violently
     from side to side.

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN rises from her chair.  She has difficulty
     standing, her limbs stiff.  She looks at White, opens her mouth
     to say something, but no sound comes out.  Instead a tiny RED
     CRAB scuttles out, across her face, and falls to the ground.
     She sits down.

     White is stunned.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Bring the witnesses.

     AN OLDER COUPLE are led out of the kitchen by a Mystery Man.
     Shown to seats behind a podium.  The woman looks sadly at White.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You are the accused's parents?

                         FATHER
               That's right.

                         MOTHER
               Yes.

                         WHITE
               Wait a minute...

                         MISTER SLACK
               You had your turn!  Let them speak.

                         WHITE (angry)
               My parents are supposed to be dead!
               You can't keep changing the damn
               rules like this!  Why go through this
               ridiculous set-up!  Why don't you
               just kill me and be done with it!

                         MISTER BLACK (smiles at parents)
               Please, continue...

                         WHITE
               This is insane!

     He looks over to the victims.

                         WHITE
               It was them, not me.
                    (points at the
                    Mystery Men)
               They killed you.

     Looks back at the Mystery Men.

                         WHITE
               You have invented all this.  History
               is a lie, not just mine, everyone's  -
               a fiction.  You are the authors.

     His knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier.

                         MISTER BLACK
               A fanciful idea, Mister White.

                         WHITE
               Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each
               one teaches you more about your
               invention.  I'm what is called a
               murderer.

     The whole court listens in silence to White's testimony.

                         WHITE
               You've given everybody memories, but
               I missed out.  The Doctor saw to that
               -  played your own game.  And now...

     WHITE looks at the MYSTERY MEN, then back at MISTER BLACK.

                         WHITE
               You're trying to get rid of me.

     There is silence.  Whispers.  Faces staring.

                         WHITE
               Why do I threaten you?  You're scared
               aren't you?

     MISTER BLACK and the gathered MYSTERY MEN look speechless at
     White.  Suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous LAUGHTER, led
     by Mister Black.

     A terrible cackle fills the room  -  all the MYSTERY MEN laugh
     hysterically, so do the mutilated victims.  The spectators in
     the adjoining room remain silent.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Ah  -  a plot.  Now we have a plot!
                    (chuckling)
               Very inventive...

     The older couple behind the podium look disturbed.

                         MOTHER
               Please, John, you're embarrassing
               us...

                         WHITE
               Shut up!

                         MISTER BLACK (chuckling still)
               You have proof?  Evidence?  Yes?

                         WHITE (holds up notebook)
               It's all here!

     Mister Black seems startled by the book, then pretends it's
     nothing.

                         MISTER BLACK
               A book of delusions.  Anything else?

                         WHITE
               But I...

                         MISTER BLACK
               I see.
                    (turns to the
                    victims)
               The verdict, yes...

                         WHITE
               Wait, this isn't fair...

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN stands again.  This time she opens her
     mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then:

                         DISEMBOWELED WOMAN (whisper)
               Guil  -  ty...

     White is agitated, fear in his face.  Mister Black stamps SOME
     PAPERS before him repeatedly.

     ON THE PAPERS  -  official-looking documents.  The stamp says:
     GUILTY.

     CLOSE on White's eyes.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Before I pronounce sentence...

     Suddenly the papers on the bench in front of Mister Black BURST
     INTO FLAMES.  Mister Black recoils, almost falling off his
     chair, taken by surprise.  The Mystery Men all look at White, a
     murmur of concern.

     Mister Black looks up at White  -  angered.

                         MISTER BLACK
               How dare you use your tricks on me!

     White, genuinely surprised, looks around.  Several Mystery Men
     BACK AWAY from him, scared.

                         WHITE
               I didn't realise...

                         MISTER BLACK
               Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are
               insignificant.

     He glares across the room, angrily.  An WOODEN CHAIR in a corner
     starts to vibrate.

     CLOSE on Mister Black's eyes.

     The chair rises into the air  -  HURLS across the room at White.

     Mister Black laughs as it crashes into the wall.  White ducks
     just in time.

     The gathered Mystery Men erupt into enthusiastic applause.

     White regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his
     own.  He lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin  -
     a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several
     plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the
     spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near
     Mister Black, making him dance back and forth comically.

     This display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a WALTZ
     playing on a floating gramophone White has also activated with
     his mind.

     SEVERAL Mystery Men are TERRIFIED.  White is amazed at his own
     performance.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You'll regret that.

     Mister Black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his
     mouth.

                         MISTER BLACK (shouts)
               SHUT IT DOWN!

     A Mystery Man by the window, picks up a phone and dials
     furiously.  Everyone in the room remains silent  -  waiting.

                         MAN ON PHONE
               Yes, we have a problem here.  Shut it
               down immediately.

     White doesn't understand what is going on.  O.S. the SOUND of
     machinery WINDING DOWN.

     ANGLE ON a clock hanging on the wall.  ON the SECOND HAND.  It
     suddenly STOPS.

     All eyes are on Mister Black.

                         MISTER BLACK
               This has all gone too far.  Yes, much
               too far.

     Mister Black starts to SHAKE.  His eyes shut, clenches his
     teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to
     the floor.

     Around the room WALLS CRACK, plaster rains down from the
     ceiling...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT.  CITY  -  NIGHT

     All over the city things START TO FALL APART  -  a devastating
     impact on the landscape.

     MONTAGE

     A street CRACKS OPEN.  Beneath the pavement are pulsating
     intestine-like organs.  These burst open with pus...

     A building vanishes...

     A car on a street corner flies into the air...

     A telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging
     itself into the concrete.  Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the
     hole left behind...

     Geysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky...

     BLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone
     steps...

     THE CITY is coming apart...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     INT.  APARTMENT H'

     The room looks like an earthquake hit it  -  broken furniture and
     gaping holes torn in the walls.

     Several MYSTERY MEN huddle behind an upturned table, watching
     WHITE and MISTER BLACK.  They face each other, both still
     standing  - mental energies focused against each other in battle.

     The fighting is taken its toll on both men.

     A DAGGER hangs suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating to face
     White with its shining silver blade.

     Mister Black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony
     fists by his side.  Pushing every ounce of mental power at the
     knife.

     White, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind
     against the knife.

     The blade STARTS TO MOVE, ever so slowly at first, towards
     White.  His body is shaking with his mental effort.  A bead of
     sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his
     vision.

     He is losing.


     INT.  KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     We see an OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE.  A group of dark figures.  WHITE
     regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table.  From his
     perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he
     removes a syringe from White's FOREHEAD.

                         FIGURE
               Good as new.  Yes.  Everything is
               easier now.

     His vision CLEARS, he can see.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Behind him a
     SMALL CROWD who turn out to be MYSTERY MEN.

     Mister Black suddenly pulls at his own face, removes the mask.

     Underneath is a mess of PULSATING ORGANS AND INSECT PARTS.
     This is what Mystery Men really look like.  He laughs, starts to
     MOVE rhythmically  -  a strange dance-step.  The others join in,
     as they too pull off masks.

     Each Man reaches up to his left ear in unison.  They pull
     squirming INSECTS out, hold them up to the light.  The insects
     scream triumphantly.

     White screams too.  And he can't stop.

     Everything goes BLACK.  Then the sound of a key rattling in a
     lock.  A door slowly creaks open...


     INT.  SEASIDE HOTEL ROOM  -  DAY

     A P.O.V. enters a small room.

     Dappled SUNLIGHT through a tattered lace curtain. A clock ticks
     on a wall.  A cough O.S. from the corridor.  A FAT MAN, talks as
     he enters:

                         FAT MAN
               It's small but clean...
                    (it isn't)
               ...and the view's nice.
                    (points to window)
               Isn't it?

     JOHN WHITE enters.  He is haggard, eyes rimmed with red.  He
     still holds the small black NOTEBOOK, tight to his chest.  He
     stands in the centre of the room, looks up.  Strangely, though
     the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories  -
     windows sit at various heights.

     White walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands.

     OUTSIDE

     A narrow street and at the end, the ocean.  The sound of distant
     surf, he can taste the salt spray.

                         WHITE (without turning)
               I'll take it.

     The man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go,
     shutting the door.  White puts the notebook down on a table near
     the open window.

     LATER

     White has fallen asleep on the bed.

     He wakes, troubled.  Stands and walks over to the sink next to
     the bed.  He moves like he is underwater.  The sea-breeze tugs at
     the curtain, draws him to the window.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings.
     TWO FIGURES  approach each other.

     He pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the
     woman, places it against the pillow on the bed.  He sits on the
     edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs
     nothing out of the ordinary.

     White is disturbed by a TINY MOVEMENT in his coat pocket.  He
     reaches in and pulls out a small, EMACIATED FISH.

     Disgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the
     creature.  White raise his foot.  His heel comes down with a
     sickening SQUISH.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY towards the notebook near the
     window.  As the SHOT TIGHTENS we can read the title on the
     cover:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     Now a sudden GUST OF WIND blows open the book.  The pages
     flicker past.  Glimpses of happy things.  A child's drawings of
     smiling people.  The sun shining down on a blue ocean full of
     sailing boats.  Fields of colourful flowers.  Cute animals.


     INT.  LONG CORRIDOR  -  DAY

     SOUND OF SURF, distant, muffled.

     CAMERA MOVES slowly towards a door.  The final door  -  no
     others beyond this.  ECHOIC FOOTSTEPS.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  His haggard face moves through darkness.  He
     looks down at his walking feet.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  White sees water, waves breaking, through the
     cracks in the floorboards of the hallway.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white-hot,
     by the SUN outside.

     ON HIS HAND  -  As he reaches towards the handle.

     ON HIS FACE  -  As the door opens.  A sharp line of light cuts
     across his features, as his eyes blink and water.  The wind
     pulls at his messy hair.  SURF NOISE is louder now.

     REVERSE ANGLE  -  WIDER  -  OUTSIDE looking through the door,
     along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape.  At
     the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of A WOMAN WITH RED
     HAIR.  She looks out at the ocean, her back turned.

     ANGLE LOOKS BACK at White standing in the open doorway, squints
     into the sun.  Suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the
     first time.  He steps OUT OF FRAME briskly  -  a weight gone
     from his shoulders.  Everything is clear finally, he knows
     exactly what to do.

     A voice recites names over a P.A. system.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     A TRACKING SHOT follows White, moves down the pier toward the
     woman.  As White steps up to her, she turns and smiles.

                         WOMAN  (indicates the sea)
               Beautiful.

     White nods slowly.  He looks out of place in his crumpled suit.
     He stares out at the ocean.  Seagulls fly over.  Sun reflects
     off waves.

                         WHITE
               Yes...

                         WOMAN
               What's your name?

     He looks at her.  Smiles.  Then, slowly, brings his hands to her
     throat.

                         WHITE
               John...  White.

          I .

          EXTREME CLOSE ON A CELL PHONE
          resting face up on a black surface. A beat of silence           -- is
          broken by its abrupt RING... RING... RING... Move in tighter
          on the phone's LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:                  555-3827
          RING... RING... RING... A hand enters frame. We follow it to
          a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The
          hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find
          a list of handwritten numbers. At least fifty. To this series
          is now added 555-3827. RING... RING... RING...

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT

          We pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over
          which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys.

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT

          A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek
          conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table,
          empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure
          hunched over a laptop.
          Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build
          not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a
          gentle, intelligent demeanor.
          Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his
          glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT

          Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty
          cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures
          of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of
          focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

          Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk.

          JONATHAN
          Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet?
          The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up.

          OLD MAN
          It is tomorrow.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          2.

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Right. I forgot.
          The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh
          stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous
          porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him --

          OLD MAN
          Anything else?

          JONATHAN
          Uh - no. No that's it, thanks.

          EXT. BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood
          streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound.
          Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first
          floor marked by unlit neon: "FLEURS DE SOLANGE." He ascends
          the steps, his keys out --

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Jonathan!
          The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find
          SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent,
          standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket.

          JONATHAN
          Solange, you're up so late?

          SOLANGE
          So early, Jonathan. We open in one hour.

          (GRINS)
          So tell me, you have been out with a lady
          friend, oui?

          JONATHAN

          (SMILES)
          Je suis desole, madame, mais no.

          SOLANGE
          But why else does a young man come home at
          such an hour?

          JONATHAN
          Just working late, that's all.

          SOLANGE
          Every night working late, working late.
          (teasing him)
          Ah, you can't fool me. You are Mister
          Mischief maker - I know this! You come by

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          3.

          CONTINUED:

          SOLANGE                                                          (CONT'D)
          later and pick out something for your lady
          friend, oui?

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Very modest. Furnishings are nice, but sparse. Jonathan hangs
          his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster
          and an old tennis trophy. Jonathan lies in bed, flipping
          channels on a small TV. Typical late night stuff:
          infommercials; CNN; a Brazilian soccer match; "Channel J"
          (public access) on which X-rated clips advertise phone sex.
          Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                  - then clicks
          back to, the roaring soccer crowd. He closes his eyes and
          drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen announcer..

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          TWO CORPORATE LAWYERS are talking shop while pouring coffee.

          JONATHAN                                                         (0.S.)
          Excuse me.
          Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them. They barely
          give him a glance as they continue their conversation.

          LAWYER 1
          So, the Knicks win last night?

          LAWYER 2
          I'm pretty sure, yeah.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, they lost by 4.
          Both pause, turn to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly.

          JONATHAN
          It was supposed to be a good game though.

          LAWYER 1
          Oh.
          (back to Lawyer 2)
          Hey, so. did you get a chance to look over
          that memo from Watkins?

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN CORRIDORS - MORNING

          Bustling - yet here too Jonathan is ignored as he carries his
          coffee past ASSISTANTS and LAWYERS talking shop. He smiles

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          4.

          CONTINUED:
          politely at those he passes; few bother to smile in return.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING .

          Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table,
          rapidly typing, eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop,
          beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post-
          its on which are scribbled various calculations. He strikes
          us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming
          array of numbers and data with methodical assurance.
          Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before
          him. Behind the glass, employees pass like fish in a tank.

          INT. MEN'S WASHROOM -- DAY

          In a stall, Jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the
          stall's marble door -- when a sudden KNOCK-KNOCK on the
          divider to his right startles him. He peers down and over, to
          expensive black wingtip shoes, a Wall St. Journal spread on
          the floor. Another KNOCK-KNOCK. Confused, Jonathan turns to
          address the divider:

          JONATHAN
          Yes?

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          Take a look at this.
          The voice sounds youthful, energetic. Its owner slides his
          Journal along the floor halfway between the marble division.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          The Japanese are developing a toilet that
          can analyze your urine for glucose levels,
          kidney disease, even cancer. They're
          referring to it as the "super bowl."

          JONATHAN
          That certainly is                                               - something.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Of course if you've ever been to Japan,
          you know they're nuts about their toilets.
          I'm talking web sites, symposiums...
          Jonathan chuckles.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          You think I'm kidding. They have bowls
          over there that cost more than a piano.
          What I want to know is how you're supposed
          to retrieve this analysis - you know, from
          your super bowl.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Maybe they're developing a fly with a
          nursing degree. A superfly.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)

          (LAUGHS)
          Who's in there anyway?

          JONATHAN
          Uh, Jonathan Messer.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          Messer... What department?

          JONATHAN
          None. I'm from Worth and Berman. I've been
          over here a few wee--
          A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off. The sound of
          zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          So you're an accountant?
          Jonathan follows the FOOTSTEPS, now addresses his stall door.

          JONATHAN
          Audit manager, yeah.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires
          Worth and Berman to give their blessing to
          our books, and they send you?

          JONATHAN
          Have laptop, will travel. What about you?

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          What about me?

          JONATHAN
          Well, I didn't get your name for one.th--
          The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          .ose.

          JONATHAN
          Sorry - I didn't catch that?
          (gets no response)
          Hello...?

          (CONTINUED)

          I said it's Wyatt. Wyatt Bose.
          Jonathan FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door -
          - only the men's room is now empty.

          COMPUVOICE                                                       (SOUND ADVANCE)
          Message-four. Three-oh-eight-pee-em.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone again, Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell
          phone. We..find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger.

          PETERSON                                                         (O.S.)
          Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to-
          confirm you're wrapping up over there at
          Rutherford Stern because the controller at
          Clancey has been on me to get someone in
          there by Thursday. I told him how
          brilliant you are, said you're the best
          auditor we've got. Anyway, I forwarded you
          some documentation...
          Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27                           a-mails ending in
          worth&berman.com. He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a
          day planner, stylus writes "Clancey" into next week. Other
          than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan still working. Only a few of the post-its now remain
          on the tabletop. Yawning, he glances at his watch -

                                                                                               MALE VOICE   (O.S.)
          12:53                                                            a.m.
          Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the'
          doorway - penetrating eyes, playful smile, familiar voice:

          WYATT
          Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home
          and saw the lights. We met before, in the
          can...

          JONATHAN
          Sure. It's Wyatt, right?
          WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something
          very likeably "on" about him.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          7

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          So do you normally work this late?

          JONATHAN
          Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of
          here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to
          finish up. What about you?

          WYATT
          You kidding? This is an early night. Hard
          to believe that once upona time a man's
          success was measured by how little he had
          to work. You know in Sweden the average
          worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation?
          (regards his stacked files)
          Do-you like accounting?

          JONATHAN
          It's all right, if you enjoy working with
          numbers. Do you like being a lawyer?

          WYATT
          It's all right. If you enjoy working with
          assholes.
          Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen.

          WYATT
          Well, I'm probably disturbing you -

          JONATHAN
          No - it's okay. Really.

          WYATT
          So Worth and Berman, huh? Don't you have
          to like be in Mensa to work there?
          Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly.

          WYATT
          Been with them long?

          JONATHAN
          Since my senior year of college. They
          subsidized my graduate degree.

          WYATT
          Really. So you were poor?
          Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          S.

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Well - I guess you could say that. I was
          raised by a single mother, and she died
          when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't
          so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people
          have had it worse.

          WYATT
          Not around here. Practically every suit I
          know is Harvard by way of Andover.

          JONATHAN
          Are you?

          WYATT
          Me? Hell no... I'm Princeton. By way of
          Exeter.
          Jonathan laughs. Wyatt smiles, takes a few idle paces.

          WYATT
          So. Jonathan.

          (GRINS)
          What do you say to a break?

          CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON A SCREENSAVER OF SWIMMING FISH. Tilt up from
          Jonathan's laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan, sitting on
          top of the expensive conference-table, passinga joint,
          staring out at the rain hammering the far windows.

          JONATHAN

          (STONED)
          .It's just sometimes I feel so - I don't
          know - removed. I mean, I work for one of
          the biggest accounting firms in the world,
          and.there's not so much as a desk there to
          prove it? They've decided all we need are
          cell phones and laptops. Messages are
          voice-mailed, documents e-mailed, salary's
          deposited online. Chet Peterson, my senior
          manager? I swear he wouldn't recognize me
          if I was sitting in his chair.
          Jonathan pauses, takes another drag, train of thought drifts:

          JONATHAN
          I don't know... I used to have friends.
          But it's like I've spent so much time
          trying to prove myself, working these
          hours                                                           - you can only do it so long before
          you look up and realize you've lost

          JONATHAN                                                        (CONT'D)
          everyone. Just - fell out of touch. With
          everyone... And I try to meet people at
          work. I do. But it's always the same. To
          the accounting staff I'm a pain because
          for two weeks they have to hold their
          breath and hope I don't pick up on any of
          their screw ups. And to everyone else, I'm
          just a temporary fixture, so why bother?
          The truth is, this is the first meaningful
          conversation I've had in I don't know how
          long. It's like if I disappeared tomorrow,
          I'm not .sure anyone other than Solange
          would even notice - she's my neighbor. I
          live on what must be the only block in
          Brooklyn that still isn't hip.

          (EXHALES)
          I guess I just never counted-on the
          isolation. It's like sometimes I look
          through that glass, and I see life
          literally passing me by.
          Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence.

          WYATT
          Jonathan?

                                                                          JONATHAN
          Yeah?

                                                                          WYATT
                                                                          By the clock on the wall there? You've
          just talked for                                                 37                                       minutes straight.
          Wyatt looks at Jonathan -- and cracks up. Jonathan hesitates,
          then he too starts to laugh so now they can't stop, their
          laughter filling the expansive room -- until it's drowned by
          the SOUND ADVANCE OF POURING RAIN...

          EXT. MIDTOWN - STREET - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan hurries in the cold. rain for the Times Square
          subway. He's just about to descend - when across                7th Avenue
          he spots a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a camel hair coat,
          clutching a slim briefcase, waiting to cross the street.
          Jonathan gazes at her, almost gasping. She's surrounded by
          pedestrians with umbrellas., she's the only one without one
          and she's DRENCHED. But she seems content to entertain
          herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the
          umbrella in front of her.
          Jonathan watches, intrigued - and then the rumble of the
          subway below reminds him he'd better move.

          

          

          

          

          10.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan stands in a long line to buy a Metrocard, his
          glasses steamed up. He takes them off to wipe the lenses.
          JONATHAN'S POV: the entire station is a blur, all unfocused,
          muted colors, no object discernible from another -
          - until his glasses return his POV to immediate focus, and he
          sees the same Young Woman in'the camel.hair coat, a pair of
          dollar bills in her hand, entering the station.
          Jonathan can't help but stare again. Despite her business
          attire, there's an almost childlike lightness. to her step.
          Jonathan notices her slim briefcase. Beneath her hand, he can
          make out the first letter of a monogram: "S."
          She checks out the long line for Metrocards, considers
          waiting, then decides life's too short. She continues past,
          headed for the turnstiles.
          Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase,
          then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow
          gap in the turnstile.
          A PANHANDLER on the other side watches her with amusement.
          Glancing up, she catches his eye, and blushes a mischievous
          smile. Once she's through, she drops her money into his
          collection - and slips out of view.
          ANGLE ON JONATHAN, still stuck on line, staring at the space
          she vacated.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM -- SHORT TIME LATER

          Jonathan arrives as an N train pulls away, the platform now
          practically. empty.
          Weary and still a bit stoned, Jonathan peers sleepily into
          the dark expanse of tunnel, yawns -
          And then he sees "S" is waiting on the same platform. Ten
          yards away. He gazes at her. She's unwrapping some GUM. He
          watches as she puts a piece in her mouth.
          The sound of an ARRIVING N TRAIN. "S" heads for it, Jonathan
          follows...
          The train halts. The door before him is the last of its car,
          the door before her the first of the next.
          The doors open.

          CONTINUED:

          II S â¢ II
          (turns to Jonathan)
          Excuse me, is this the train for canal
          Street?
          It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice. She's even
          more arresting up close.

          JONATHAN
          Uh,.either one is                                               -- I mean the N and the
          R both stop there so, you know, either
          way, I mean, this is the right train. Yes.
          SOS Of
          Thanks.
          "S" enters her car. Jonathan wavers, wants to follow into her
          car but doesn't have the nerve. He enters a different car.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER

          Jonathan's slumped against a window, annoyed. at himself for
          not getting in her car.
          He can see 'S'. She sits in the other car chewing her gum. He
          studies her, he's absolutely knocked out by her.

          CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
          Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next.
          He sees "S" rising to join the small crowd gathering by a
          door.
          Jonathan stands up - his last chance. Determined, he braces
          himself and rises, grasping his briefcase.
          The screeching of brakes as the train grinds into "CANAL ST.

          STATION."
          A sudden JOLT of the braking train.causes Jonathan to stumble
          slightly and his briefcase BANGS against a seat and SNAPS
          OPEN - contents tumbling out. His cell phone hits the floor.
          Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train lurches
          to a halt, nearly knocking him over, and sliding his cell
          phone a few feet along the grimy floor.
          O.S. we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs
          for his phone a second before it's stepped on. He hurriedly
          stuffs it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and
          paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet -
          - to find the doors closing, and "S" gone.

          CONTINUED:
          Devastated, he hurries to a window, searching the platform as
          the train begins to depart... He can just glimpse the back of
          her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel.
          He stands helpless, just shuts his eyes and lowers his head.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          Jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing Wyatt
          enter, talking animatedly with Lawyers                          1   and 2. Caught up in
          telling his joke, Wyatt doesn't seem to notice Jonathan.
          Only when the lawyers burst out laughing does Wyatt glance
          up. His eyes meet Jonathan's. Jonathan smiles in greeting -
          but Wyatt just nods coolly, returns to his fellow lawyers.
          Jonathan's smile falters. He exits wordlessly.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - DAY

          Jonathan hands over files and CD-Roms to a less than sociable

          ASSISTANT CONTROLLER.

          JONATHAN
          I guess that's it. then. Nice meeting you.

          ASSISTANT CONTROLLER
          Uh huh.
          Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back.

          JONATHAN
          Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt
          Bose's office?
          The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance.

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here.
          She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a
          laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's
          eyes follow her lazy finger down the list --

          A GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, quit looking down her shirt!
          Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to
          find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor.

          WYATT
          Leaving, huh? So where to next?

          (CONTINUED)

          JONATHAN
          Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols
          after that.
          Wyatt's about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in
          the hall. Wyatt taps the lawyer's shoulder.

          WYATT
          Hey, wait up a sec.
          (smiles back)
          Well, good meeting you, Jonathan.
          ,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer.
          Jonathan bends for his briefcase -

          WYATT                                                           (O.S.)
          Wait, so you have off tomorrow?
          Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall.

          WYATT
          You don't happen to have .a. decent
          backhand, do you?

          INT. MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY

          Beneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play
          mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20's).
          Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net
          Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan
          and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his
          brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return.

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt
          returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball
          back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it
          back. Jonathan returns it with equal force.
          A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back
          each ball. The women step aside. Jonathan lunges, barely
          managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his
          racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball.
          Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a
          near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two
          inches outside the opposite baseline.

          WYATT
          Out!

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          14.

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air. Silence - then
          Wyatt's SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space.

          WYATT
          Commiserations, Messer. Good game.
          They shake hands at the net. Jonathan is exhausted.

          WYATT

          (WARMLY)
          Develop akiller instinct and you'll beat
          the crap out of me.
          Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she's
          already gone to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the
          court. From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to
          the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter.
          The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops over the net.

          WYATT
          They asked if we'd fancy a post-game
          cocktail. Don't worry, I got us out of it.
          Jonathan is barely able to speak.

          JONATHAN
          Oh? I would've been happy to.

          WYATT
          Are you kidding? They're a couple of first
          years at Merrill. Screw that, we can do
          better. Hey, you OK?
          Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet.

          INT. RACKET CLUB LOUNGE

          Soft jazz plays as Wyatt leads Jonathan past the bar area.
          Wyatt is admiring Jonathan's weathered tennis racket.

          WYATT
          Man, I remember when these first came out.
          I think I was a frosh at boarding school.
          (chuckles; fingers a string)
          Jeez, are these strings natural gut?

          JONATHAN
          Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut
          and Kevlar. They're pretty obscure now. I
          should replace them, they're all frayed...

          CONTINUED:
          Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his pace, his eyes
          suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar.
          From behind, it looks remarkably like "S"...
          Only, as she turns, her profile proves otherwise.

          INT. LOCKER ROOK!

          Wyatt and Jonathan in towels, heading for the showers.
          Jonathan still deep in the 'S' moment -

          WYATT
          Have you ever considered contacts?
          Jonathan halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face       -
          his eyeglasses in particular.

          JONATHAN
          Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was
          allergic to something in the solution.

          WYATT
          Too bad. You have an attractive face. Your
          eyes especially.
          Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel.

          WYATT
          It's not a come on, just an observation.
          (considers him a beat)
          You don't get much, do you.

          JONATHAN
          What - you mean sex?

          WYATT
          No, flood insurance. How many women have
          you slept with?

          JONATHAN
          Oh, I don't know, not a whole-

          WYATT
          Of course you know. Everyone knows.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe - four.

          WYATT
          Maybe four?

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Okay fine, just four. What about you?

          WYATT
          Me? I have no idea.

          JONATHAN
          What? You just said everyone -

          WYATT
          I meant everyone like you.
          Confused, Jonathan looks up -- as Wyatt disappears into a
          shower stall.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan emerges freshly showered, a towel around his waist
          as he walks toward the rows of lockers.

          WYATT                                                          (O.S.)
          Tonight?... Fine. I'm on the list?
          Jonathan finds Wyatt half-dressed, seated on a bench by a
          locker and talking on his cell phone.

          WYATT
          There better be.
          Wyatt hangs up, looks up to find Jonathan staring, puzzled.

          WYATT
          Something wrong?
          Jonathan reaches into his locker for his hanging jacket, and
          pulls out his own cell phone. It's identical to Wyatt's.

          JONATHAN
          We have the same phone.

          WYATT
          Oh - and you thought I was using yours?
          I can afford my own phone calls, you know.

          JONATHAN
          No, I wasn't                                                   -- of course you can-

          WYATT
          I'm pulling your dick, Jonathan.
          (grins, slams his locker)
          Actually, I was just firming up some plans
          for tonight. Are you free?

          JONATHAN

          (SURPRISED)
          Me? Sure, I guess                                               - but I don't want to

          INTRUDE-

          WYATT
          You're not. What do you say, are you in?

          JONATHAN
          I guess I could go home and change.

          WYATT
          To Brooklyn? Forget it, you can borrow
          something of mine.

          INT. WYATT'S BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

          A three-story brownstone in an expensive West Village
          neighborhood. As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase, they
          pass a papery-faced GENTLEMAN                                   (50s) in a fine suit.

          WYATT
          t                                                               a                       uten Abend, Herr Kleiner.
          (glances back)
          This way, Jonathan.

          INT. WYATT'S APARTMENT

          Urban chic to a serious degree. Big terrace, funky furniture,
          framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive
          young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image
          of a burning candle just slightly out of focus.

          WYATT
          Like it? It's a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner
          downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he
          hooked me up with the gallery in Munich.
          Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders,
          pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are
          like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by
          one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair
          bleached blonde and loosely spiked.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Talk about a bad look.
          Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right
          behind him,. a slick, expensive SUIT draped over his arm.

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          Here, try this one.
          (off Jonathan's hesitation)
          What?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off.

          WYATT
          You hope you can pull it off. You know who
          you remind me of? James Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Who?

          WYATT
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.. Real smart                                 - witty too, when
          you loosened him up. Only from day one, he
          just didn't fit in. For starters, he was
          dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there
          was always this boundary - this wall -
          between Getz and everyone else. You could
          argue we laid the foundation, but he built
          it. Built it by believing the lie.

          JONATHAN
          What lie?

          WYATT
          That he was any different. The clothes,
          the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all
          one big masquerade. Anyone can get in,
          you've just got to wear a costume. But
          Getz never got that. He assumed he could
          never scale the wall, when the truth is he
          was the only one guarding it. It never
          occurred to him his anonymity could be an
          asset. No one gets over like the guy who's
          just a face, an impression. We are - all
          of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be.

          JONATHAN
          So what happened to him?

          WYATT
          Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself.

          JONATHAN
          (hesitates a beat)
          You're pulling my dick, aren't you.
          Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks.

          With both hands.
          Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit.

          CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN                                       (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat.
          He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders:

          EMCEE
          And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine,
          the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you
          to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour!

          INT. THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT

          An ultra-elite "new burlesque" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s
          Parisian decor. Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS, male and female,
          sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE
          performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease.
          Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted
          with. an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a
          small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag
          films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience.

          WYATT
          It's a little self-conscious, but I
          thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's
          that suit working out?

          JONATHAN
          Oh - great, actually.

          WYATT
          Keep it then. I've got two just like it.
          Jonathan's about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives.

          WAITRESS
          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy, gentlemen.

          JONATHAN
          Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass?

          WYATT
          We'll try not to spill any.
          (regards the floor show)
          So what's the wildest thing you've ever
          done? Sexually, I mean.

          JONATHAN
          The wildest thing? Oh I don't know, I've
          never been too adventuresome.

          WYATT
          All right, what's the lamest thing then?

          JONATHAN
          The lamest...
          Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, that was probably a few months
          ago. I was flipping through money magazine
          and saw this small ad in the back. It read
          something like "Are. you feeling all alone?
          Looking to meet women but have forgotten
          how?" And-there was this number.

          WYATT
          And you called it? So what happened?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing actually. The phone just kept
          ringing. And that's it.
          Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up.

          JONATHAN
          Lame enough for you?

          WYATT
          You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine.
          That is beyond lame.
          Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table
          lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then
          picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          .Hello?
          Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE
          at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          .All right... Goodbye.
          Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt.

          JONATHAN
          She wants to dance.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          ON THE DANCE FLOOR - LATER
          Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old
          Edith Piaf ballad. He looks over her shoulder to his table,
          where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone.
          Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud
          smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself.
          The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear...

          BACK TO WYATT AND JONATHAN'S TABLE
          Wyatt clicks off his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan
          returning alone, looking deflated.

          JONATHAN
          She's a hooker.
          Wyatt shrugs, grinning.

          JONATHAN
          Hold on - you knew? What - are all the
          women here prostitutes?

          WYATT
          That depends on what you mean by that
          word. Stretch the definition and you could
          incorporate most of the men as well.
          (sips his drink)
          You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only
          belong to a union, they have to pay taxes.

          JONATHAN
          You seem to possess quite a store of
          international trivia.

          WYATT
          Not really. I just get around... Jonathan,
          relax. It's not like she just shot your
          dog. I was only trying to help. Besides,
          what are you looking for - a relationship?
          As if you have time for one? This was your
          first day off in how long?

          JONATHAN
          Three weeks.

          WYATT
          Four for me. Face it, we've mortgaged our
          youth. Pimped out our twenties. But we
          still have needs. And there's nothing
          shameful about wanting them met.

          JONATHAN
          So you sleep with hookers?

          WYATT

          (LAUGHING)
          Me? Never.

          JONATHAN
          So how do you - meet your needs?
          Wyatt studies him a beat, another French love song drifting
          in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl.

          WYATT
          What if I told you...
          (breaks off, laughs)
          Christ, I sound like an infommercial.

          JONATHAN
          What were you going to say?

          WYATT
          Listen. You don't think that women have
          these same urges? Young women, just like
          ourselves, successful and working their
          asses off to stay that way? You better
          believe they do.

          JONATHAN
          And?

          WYATT
          And - well - let's just say, there's a
          way...a way it can be taken care of.

          JONATHAN
          You make it sound like a mob hit.
          Wyatt smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show.

          INT. TAXI CAB - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Jonathan are in the back seat. A quiet beat.

          JONATHAN
          What you were talking about, before.
          Peoples' needs...
          Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin:

          WYATT
          Some other time.

          At the corner, please. The Rhiga Royal.
          (to Jonathan)
          Listen, I have to meet someone..

          JONATHAN

          (SURPRISED)
          Oh... okay.
          The cab pulls up before the RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL.

          WYATT
          Hey. You had a good time tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. Yeah I did. Thanks.

          WYATT
          I'm glad. Listen, that thing with the
          hooker, I'm really sorry if I                                   -

          JONATHAN
          Forget it. It was funny.
          Wyatt smiles warmly, pats Jonathan's shoulder.

          WYATT
          I'll give you a call tomorrow.
          Wyatt                                                           climbs out. Jonathan watches through the cab window as
          Wyatt disappears into the golden glow of the lobby.
          LATER: Driving in the cab, Jonathan catches his reflection in
          the glass. He smiles, liking how he looks in Wyatt's suit.
          Outside, rainy Manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur.

          JONATHAN
          (To driver)
          Hey. Could you let me out at the next
          corner over there, on 7th Avenue?

          EXT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY - LATER

          Jonathan stands in the exact spot where he first saw "S".
          He buys a New York Times and a hot-dog.
          Pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted
          to the spot,.hoping he'll see that face in the crowd.
          After a while he shakes his head at the ridiculousness of it
          and heads down into the-subway.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - A CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

          Clancey's stiff CONTROLLER                                      (50s) hovers nervously over
          Jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table.

          24.

          CONTINUED:
          Beside him we see he's set up his laptop, phone charger,
          pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel post-its.

          CLANCEY CONTROLLER
          Any problems, you'll want to see Julie
          Levinson, she's our assistant controller                       -
          or if she's busy, Scott Werner, our senior
          accountant. If Werner's unavailable, we
          have two staff accountants                                     - but like I
          said, I don't anticipate any problems. I
          mean we've never had any before, so...

          JONATHAN
          Right.I just need the access codes for
          the accounts and sub-accounts?
          The Controller suddenly looks uneasy.

          JONATHAN
          You've got account numbers, but no access
          codes. Without those I can't get the banks
          to authorize statement verification.
          (beat; smiles)
          Besides, how else can I steal the money?

          CLANCEY CONTROLLER
          What?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing, I was just pulling your-- leg. I
          do need those codes though, when you get a
          chance.

          INT. CLANCEY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Other than Jonathan's suit and tie, the reduced number of
          post-its and the lighter stack of files                        - little has changed.
          Jonathan is hunched over his laptop. Like Rutherford Stern's
          conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall.
          Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference
          to him. Slightly different tank, slightly different fish.
          CLOSE ON A BUSINESS CARD: a Rutherford Stern masthead,
          beneath it Wyatt's name and office number. Jonathan picks up
          his cell phone and dials it. RING... RING -

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Hey, Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          How'd you know it was-

          WYATT (O.S.)
          You really ought to block your caller ID.
          So - same place as yesterday?

          EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

          Along the entire square of ledge, throngs of SUITED BUSINESS
          TYPES bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare. It's here
          we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite.

          WYATT
          I wonder what the Founding Fathers would
          make of this scene.
          Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing
          expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to
          work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat.

          JONATHAN
          I'm just glad to be outside.
          (awkwardly heartfelt)
          I've got to tell you, this has been great,
          meeting up for lunch. I used to just-
          A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their
          jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's
          ringing. Jonathan rests his down on the ledge.

          WYATT
          Yes?... Shit. Okay, see if you can.gettme
          on the 6:15                                                     out of JFK tonight... Fine.
          Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to Jonathan's.

          WYATT
          Rutherford needs me to join him asap in
          London to paper some financing with
          Lloyds. I tell you about this?

          JONATHAN
          No - no you didn't.

          WYATT
          Yeah, I should be gone a few weeks.
          Jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in.

          JONATHAN
          Sounds exciting.

          WYATT
          Nah, it'll be boring as sin.

          Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his cell phone and rises
          from the ledge.

          WYATT
          Shit, I'd better get back. You ready?

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

          Sitting before his laptop, Jonathan takes out his cell phone
          and punches in some numbers.

          COMPUVOICE                                                     (O.S.)

          ENTERED-IS-NOT-VALID-PLEASE-TRY-YOUR-
          He enters the numbers again, receives the same prerecorded
          message. He hangs up -- when it abruptly RINGS, surprising
          him. He stares at the phone a curious beat, then answers it.

          JONATHAN
          Jonathan Mess-
          CLICK. Dead air. More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat          - then
          replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger.

          INT. CLANCEY BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          As ignored as ever, Jonathan is squeezed among EMPLOYEES on
          their way home. TWO SECRETARIES speak in hushed tones:

          SECRETARY 1
          .That's just it. You caught him in a
          lie, so now everything he says you have to-
          RING of a cell phone. RING... RING... It's Jonathan's.
          Surprised, he takes out the phone, presses talk.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          A soft, electronic rustle from the other end... then:

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                  (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                  (O.S.)
          I asked if you're free tonight.

          INT. SUBWAY STATION

          Jonathan is heading for the DOWNTOWN N/R when:. RING...
          RING... His cell phone again. He steps aside and answers:

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          The CRACKLE OF STATIC on the other end. Then:

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Actually I am, but I don't think I'm who
          The static on the other end worsens.

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          I'm sorry, I didn't get that?

          JONATHAN
          I said I am free, but I                                         -

          JONATHAN
          The hotel? I - I guess, but -

          Beneath the Eloise portrait.
          THE ROAR OF A TRAIN pulling in. Only when the train passes
          can he hear the other end. But now there's no one there.
          Jonathan stares at his cell phone - and frowns.
          Close on the phone's display as Jonathan scrolls down its
          list of stored numbers. His expression says none are
          familiar. And NOW he gets it.

          INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

          A heavy-set CABBIE glances in his mirror at Jonathan in back,
          cell phone to his ear.

          Hi, it's Jonathan, I've got your cell! I
          guess you must have mine. I imagine you're
          in the air now, but call when you get
          this. if you do. Oh, and you got a call
          from someone who I'm...forget it, just
          call me.
          Jonathan hangs up.

          CABBIE
          So where ya visiting from?

          JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

          CABBIE
          You're from out of town, right?

          JONATHAN

          (PUZZLED)
          Me? No.

          CABBIE
          Huh. I can usually tell. You seem like a
          tourist.

          JONATHAN
          I've lived here all my life!

          CABBIE
          No offence, pal.
          The cabbie pulls over on Central Park South. Jonathan leans
          forward, peers up at the gorgeous French Renaissance facade.

          CABBIE
          Well, here ya are. The Plaza.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Sheer elegance. Wealthy GUESTS stroll, chat, lounge. Hotel
          STAFF in immaculate uniforms greet, assist, etc..
          Jonathan anxiously wanders the perimeter, then slows as he
          spies a PORTRAIT OF A PRECOCIOUS LITTLE GIRL grinning at him.

          SAME SCENE - SHORT TIME LATER
          Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait,
          glancing at his watch, growing restless, unsure --

          Pardon me, but may I ask you something -
          personal?
          Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an
          attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She's. around his age, slender to the
          point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit.

          THE BLONDE
          Are you waiting for me?

          JONATHAN
          I                                                                - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt,
          right?

          THE BLONDE
          Excuse me?
          (hesitates, appraising him)
          I'm sorry, did we speak earlier?

          JONATHAN
          Yes. Yes we did -

          THE BLONDE
          Good. Let's go then.

          INT. PLAZA - ELEVATOR

          Jonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an
          ELDERLY COUPLE. The couple smile at the handsome pair.
          Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the
          lit numbers. He notices a ROOM KEY in her hand.

          JONATHAN
          (whispers aside)
          Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and
          I., we don't know each other...?
          She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips.

          THE BLONDE
          No fooling.
          DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows.

          THE HALLWAY
          Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The
          Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room.

          JONATHAN
          What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain
          there's been some kind of mistake.

          You're not who I spoke with on the phone?

          JONATHAN
          No - I mean, yes, but -

          THE BLONDE
          You're not attracted to me?

          JONATHAN
          Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          -

          THE BLONDE
          It's just what... exactly?
          She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to
          explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a
          moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long.

          INT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER

          A smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies
          lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's
          tentativeness is all but gone.
          Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under
          waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow
          annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language:

          THE BLONDE
          Fuck.
          LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of
          mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but
          she's fast asleep.

          INT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          On the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open.
          Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all
          alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the
          FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am.
          He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her.

          INT. PLAZA - RECEPTION DESK - MORNING

          Showered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a DESK CLERK.

          checked out at                                                 6:20                                   this morning.

          JONATHAN
          Well could you tell me the name of the
          guest who was staying there?

          DESK CLERK
          I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose
          information regarding our guests. If you
          give me her name, I can confirm if she was
          registered here.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, the thing is... it's okay.
          Forget it.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - MORNING

          Jonathan exits to good tidings from the BELL STAFF. Lost in
          his thoughts, it takes him a moment to respond.
          He starts to walk. His cell RINGS. He answers.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Hey, you're up early!

          JONATHAN
          Hi! How's London?

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Raining. So you've got mine-and I've.got
          yours?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. Listen, last night...um...I met this-

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Damn! Sorry, I'm gonna have to call you
          back, they want me in a meeting. Hey, no
          long distance calls, okay!
          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan shakes his head, amused. He hails a
          cab, glances back at the hotel. His lips curl into a vaguely
          proud, if still dazed, smile.

          

          

          

          

          32.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - DAY

          Jonathan sits alone at the long conference table, working but
          distracted. He pauses, eyes Wyatt's cell phone sitting there.

          INSERT - EXTREME CLOSE ON THE CELL PHONE'S DISPLAY WINDOW
          The numbers stored have no names associated with them. It's
          just a series of undesignated seven-digit sequences, a list
          of phone numbers that seems to go on and on.
          Jonathan clicks on a number at random. It highlights itself.
          Jonathan hesitates, then clicks again. The number is dialled.
          RING...RING - a woman with an elegant BRITISH ACCENT answers:

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.0.)
          Yes?

          JONATHAN
          Hello, um - I'm sorry to bother you                             -

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.O.)
          How did you get this number?

          JONATHAN
          Through a friend.

                                                                          BRITISH ACCENT                             (V.0.)

          if you'll excuse me                                             -

          JONATHAN
          wait -
          Jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up.

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.O.)
          Yes?
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN. What to say? And then:

          JONATHAN
          (braces himself, swallows)
          Are you free tonight?
          He shuts his eyes, ready for a hang up. A long silence.

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)
          I can be.
          Jonathan opens his eyes half in disbelief.

          Where?

          JONATHAN
          Where. Right... The Plaza?

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)
          I'm afraid that's a bit uptown for me.
          Perhaps the Mercer? Say by the
          Shakespeare, half past eleven?

          JONATHAN
          The Shakespeare?

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                 (V.0.)
          It should be fairly evident.

          INT. THE MERCER HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          The SoHo industrial motif is the antithesis of the Plaza. By
          a vintage book library we find a sleekly dressed YOUNG BLACK
          WOMAN perusing spines of Salinger, Scott, Sheherazade -

          JONATHAN                                                       (O.S.)
          Excuse me, um - I'm sorry to disturb you -
          She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of
          Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in her hand.

          JONATHAN
          I'm - supposed to meet someone here and-

          BRITISH ACCENT
          You're rather new to this, aren't you?
          Jonathan falters. She smiles.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          That's okay. I like that.

          LOBBY ELEVATOR
          She enters first, then Jonathan. He waits for her.to push a
          button - only it seems she's waiting for him to do the same.

          JONATHAN
          I'm sorry, what floor?
          She rolls her eyes.

          BACK TO THE HOTEL LOBBY
          Jonathan and British Accent cross the lobby once more.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Frankly I'm surprised that whoever gave
          you access didn't explain more.

          (SIGHS)
          Right then, the rules: One,.no names, no
          jobs                                                           - no nothing. Two, latex is mandatory
                                                                         and non-negotiable.. Three, no rough stuff   -
          the only rule that's even remotely
          malleable provided there's mutual consent,
          although I say if that's your thing, take
          it elsewhere. And finally...
          She halts a few feet from the registration desk.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          The initiator is responsible for the room.

          JONATHAN
          (takes him a second)
          Oh - so I should...?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Precisely.

          BACK IN THE ELEVATOR
          Jonathan is holding a key card. British Accent is leaning
          against the opposite wall, eyeing him with a slight grin. A
          moment. DING. The elevator doors open.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          They are headed for a room as he ventures another question:

          JONATHAN
          So are there a lot of - people - who do
          this?
          She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when
          the CREAK OF A CART causes them to glance up: a ROOM SERVICE
          WAITER is crossing past the far end of the hall. Jonathan
          turns back to find her staring at him uneasily.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          How did you get into this?

          JONATHAN
          Well, a friend of mine -

          BRITISH ACCENT
          He uploaded your numbers but failed to
          explain the basics?

          (off her frown)
          I'm doing something wrong, aren't I?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          It's not that, it's just... well, you
          strike me as something of a stowaway. In
          fact if I were more suspicious, I'd say
          you didn't belong here at all.
          Flustered, Jonathan's about to offer some explanation ---

          BRITISH ACCENT
          But obviously somebody felt you did.
          The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan -- Wyatt!

          BRITISH ACCENT
          And I'm a sucker for bashful boys...
          She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm... and
          removes the key card from his hand.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and British Accent having sex. She has his arms
          pinned back, writhing on top of him, clearly enjoying the
          control - Jonathan remains awed, just enjoying the ride.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - BEDROOM- LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan lies in bed-beside British Accent.

          JONATHAN
          Can I ask you something? Why do you do
          this?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Why are any of us doing this? For the
          economics of the arrangement.
          (rolls over, away from him)
          It's intimacy without intricacy.
          Jonathan's about to reply --

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Look, I've got a 7                                            a.m. breakfast, so...
          She says no more. Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat.

          JONATHAN
          Well - good night.

          Jonathan.alone at his laptop, the stack of files down to a
          bare few. He dials a number on 'his' cell:

          JONATHAN
          (into phone)
          Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess
          you're busy.with stuff over there.
          (smiles to himself)
          I've been kinda busy too! I've been
          wondering - did you mean for me to take
          your phone?

          EXT. RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Jonathan walks the carpet-draped sidewalk toward the entrance
          - then pauses, looks around in recognition of this same spot
          where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can
          see you grinning right now.
          Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps
          inside --

          JONATHAN                                                        (V.0.)
          Anyway, I just wanted to say... thank you.
          SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SWELLING: to herald a MONTAGE:

          INT. THE BENJAMIN - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Jonathan seems somewhat more relaxed as he lingers in the
          lobby. A woman with a BOYISH HAIRCUT taps his shoulder.

          INT. THE REGENCY - A ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and an ASIAN WOMAN having sex on a plush celadon
          carpet, two briefcases resting side by side a few feet away.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENT SERVICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone as usual, Jonathan now seems strangely contented in
          this isolated state. WORKERS pass in the wall of glass, but
          now he doesn't bother looking up.
          In his briefcase, we note the inclusion of a toiletries bag.

          At a registration desk, Jonathan hands his credit card to a
          DESK CLERK. A BELLHOP gestures to a luggage cart. Jonathan
          shakes his head, looking confidently past him to a TALL WOMAN
          seated inconspicuously among the various out-of-towners.

          INT. THE DRAKE - ROOM - MORNING

          Jonathan wakes up alone, his necktie knotted around a
          bedpost. He reaches for the phone, presses "Room Service."

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - COPY ROOM - DAY

          Jonathan is waiting to make some copies when the SECRETARY at
          the copier hands him a stack of paper...

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Can you hold these?

          INT. THE MARK - ROOM -- LATE NIGHT

          .only the voice belongs to the woman Jonathan is having sex
          with - referring to her legs that she wraps around him.

          INT. THE FITZPATRICK - SUNDRY SHOP                              - MORNING

          Jonathan buys a bottle of O.J. and a 36-count box of condoms.

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - CORRIDOR DAY

          Carrying his coffee mug, Jonathan suddenly slows, his eyes
          locked on The Blonde with whom he'd first been at the Plaza.
          Her eyes fix on his as he.nears                                 - a flash of mutual
          recognition... then nothing as they pass without a word.
          Jonathan can't help but allow himself the slightest grin.

          INT. HOTEL ELYSEE - THE "CLUB ROOM"                             - NIGHT

          Jonathan wades confidently through a sea of YOUNG EXECUTIVES.
          He approaches a REDHEADED BUSINESSWOMAN. He asks her
          something. She looks up, confused ---
          -- when ANOTHER REDHEAD taps his shoulder. Her free hand
          slips into his,. their fingers interlocking...

          INT. THE PARAMOUNT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          . PULL BACK from interlocked fingers to find Jonathan's
          hand entwined with ANOTHER WOMAN'S. We realize we're watching

          to Jonathan and YET ANOTHER WOMAN having sex. The bed
          keeps banging against the night stand - a glass of water,
          moving closer to the edge with every bang. There's something
          almost rote about it, a numbness in the repetition... the
          glass FALLS, HITS the ground and BREAKS.
          MATCH CUT TO: Jonathan PLUNGES into water.

          INT. THE PENINSULA - HEALTH CLUB - MORNING

          Jonathan doing laps. He emerges from the pool, strides with
          confidence past the tourists flanking him on either side:
          OLDER COUPLES snoozing, PARENTS adjusting floaties on kids,
          BUSINESS TRAVELLERS with airport novels.
          He continues toward us, hair slicked back, like Wyatt's.

          MONTAGE ENDS/ CUT TO :

          EXT. BROOKLYN - JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jonathan arrives at his building's steps to find Solange
          hurrying out of her flower shop. She embraces him warmly.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, for so long I don't see you!

          JONATHAN
          J'ai ete tres occupe. with work.
          He's exhausted. And no longer so exhilarated by his nightly
          activities.

          SOLANGE
          Work? No, no. You believe you can trick
          me, Mr. Mischief Maker! I want to meet
          this lady friend of yours.
          Jonathan is about to protest -

          SOLANGE
          Ah., ah                                                        - ecoutez, I have beautiful winter-
          roses, just. arrived. She.will swoon...
          Jonathan smiles, but there's a reticence to it.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe later, okay?

          SOLANGE
          There is no later when it comes to love!
          If you find it, you must not let it go.

          Jonathan nods absently, continues up the steps                  - when she
          tugs his sleeve. He turns to her; she searches his eyes.

          SOLANGE
          There really is no one?
          Jonathan evasively shakes his head.

          SOLANGE
          There should be, Jonathan. It is not good
          for a young man to be too much alone.
          He gives her an uncomfortable smile. She smiles back, but as
          she heads inside, she looks both-sad and worried for him.
          Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door and
          disappears inside. We remain on the vacant street, hear his
          FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his
          cell phone. A beat, then another...
          .and the front door opens again as Jonathan steps back out
          into the night.

          INT. THE HUDSON HOTEL - LOBBY -- LATE NIGHT

          Checking his reflection in a mirror while he waits, Jonathan
          faintly hears what sounds like WYATT'S LAUGH. He quickly
          turns to the sound: a bar off the lobby. Through slotted
          glass he scans the backs of heads: a group of business men.
          Reflected in the mirror, a WOMAN appears behind him. Jonathan
          freezes, his eyes grow wide -

          WOMAN
          Excuse me...
                                                                          He doesn't breathe. Utterly stunned, he turns to confirm...
          It's her.                                                       -It's "S".

          INT. THE HUDSON - ELEVATOR

          Jonathan stares at her in sheer disbelief but she's
          oblivious, smiling casually back at him.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          "S" enters first, flips on the light, proceeds inside.
          Jonathan enters tentatively behind her, eyes still glued.
          "S" takes off her coat, drapes it over a chair. Jonathan
          remains still and silent, just watching. She undoes the
          wrists of her blouse, then the collar button.

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan is about to say something but can't. She undoes the
          next button. We can glimpse a bra. She undoes the next --

          JONATHAN
          Before we...um, the thing is                                   - I know you.
          She glances up, curious                                        - her hand lingering by the front
          clasp of her bra.

          JONATHAN
          Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met
          before. In the Times Square subway
          station. It was raining...

          â S â

          (GRINS)
          In the subway?

          JONATHAN
          You had no umbrella. You were soaked.

          âC,.
          It's true, I don't have an umbrella.

          JONATHAN
          Then you asked me if the N train stops at
          Canal.
          She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles
          warmly and continues to unbutton her blouse.

          JONATHAN
          Wait.

          âSÂ»
          Is something the matter?

          JONATHAN
          This just seems strange, that's all.

          SÂ
          Because you've seen me before?

          JONATHAN
          Maybe. I don't know, it's just                                 -

          (EXHALES)
          Ever since that night on the train, I've
          thought about how nice it would be to see
          you again. And now suddenly, here you are,
          taking off your clothes.
          â S of
          Bingo! So what's the problem?

          She starts to button her blouse back up.

          âSâ
          Well, maybe some other time.
          Jonathan is thrown as she reaches for her coat -

          JONATHAN
          Wait - don't go.
          She glances back curiously.

          JONATHAN
          What I mean is, by any chance... are you
          hungry?

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN

          A BELLMAN rolls a cart noiselessly down the carpet, placing
          early editions of the New York Times before each room.
          He pauses by a door, quietly leaves anewspaper. We can hear
          the sound of JONATHAN AND "S" TALKING AND LAUGHING...

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          They sit across from each other Indian-style on the bed. The
          radio is tuned to a pop music station. They're finishing a
          meal of burgers and fries, getting along famously.
          You have some ketchup on your chin.

          JONATHAN
          sorry, I'm a messy eater.
          âsâ
          Me too.
          Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes
          the napkin, dabs it in water and cleans him up.

          By the way, my name's-

          Don't!
          She puts her finger to his lips. A first touch. An
          electricity between them.

          âC/,
          (a playful smile)
          You know the rules. No names.

          JONATHAN
          The 'rules' seem to specify no
          conversation either.
          as.,
          They are a little rigid, aren't they? But
          I think we should obey the 'no names'.
          It'll be fun!

          Ah, but I know.yours begins with an 'S'.
          âSir

          Her face is an inch from his, the moment mysterious   and           sexy.

          'S' laughs.

          She makes a little sound of encouragement.

          Hmmm. Hmmm. The mysterious 'S' alighted
          from the train at Canal Street. She may
          well be from 'downtown'...hmm...ah! Of

          You first.

          JONATHAN

          perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The
          tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe.
          And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares
          at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away.
          He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S SLEEPING FACE. His eyes slowly open.
          JONATHAN'S POV: her purse is no longer on the chair.
          He raises his head, sees that she's gone. He stares at her
          pillow. The indentation where she slept. Smiles to himself.
          He gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom. There's a NOTE
          on the desk on hotel note paper:
          Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will
          call u later. Sunbeam xxx

          Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night
          - at the Hudson.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you've been
          enjoying my little gift.

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I
          met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl.

          I'd like to say it's a long story but it's
          not. When you are coming back, you gotta
          meet her.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          So she's, what, a lawyer or something?

          JONATHAN
          I-have no idea, I don't know all that much
          about her. All I know is I can't wait to
          see her again.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          Listen, I don't want to dampen your
          spirits, but - be careful, okay?

          JONATHAN
          What do you mean by that?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          Nothing. I'm just saying, this club                         - who
          knows who anybody is, right?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah, yeah, yeah but - sometimes you just
          have to go with what you feel, don't you?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          True enough. Hold on a sec.
          Muffled sounds of Wyatt talking to someone else.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          It's non stop back-to-back bullshit here.
          Listen, I'll call you later. And hey -
          congratulations!
          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan smiles. And then reads the note
          again - grinning.

          The morning crush of executives filing toward elevators.

          Jonathan is working on his laptop, clearly distracted. He

          He calls up the list of "Recent Calls: Incoming," scrolls up
          to the top number. It reads: "Number Unavailable."
          Jonathan looks worried, wondering how he can get a hold of
          her - when his cell phone rings. He immediately picks up.

          I think you have the wrong number.

          EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

          Jonathan arrives at the subway station. He's a little anxious
          now, still hasn't heard from her. He lingers at the top of
          the stairs, not wanting to descend. Below him he can hear the
          lonely roar of a train pulling in below.
          only when the train quiets down does Jonathan realize his
          cell phone is ringing. He picks up.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          Intermittent static on the other end. And then what sounds
          like a WOMAN GASPING; it's unclear if it's a sound of
          pleasure or pain.

          JONATHAN
          .Hello?
          The Gasping comes faster; Jonathan debates hanging up - when
          the gasps halt,--replaced by the faintest whisp__of_ a female
          voice: "No... No please..." There's no mistaking the tone now
          it's fear - then. suddenly a shrill, terrified SCREAM...
          - and the line goes dead. Jonathan stares breathlessly at the
          phone in his hand, like he's just witnessed something awful.
          He quickly checks the display: "Number Unavailable."
          Jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was "S"-
          - when the phone rings again. He hesitates, then picks up.

          (COYLY)
          Are you free tonight?
          Jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her voice.

          EXT. CHINATOWN - CANAL STREET - NIGHT

          Jonathan stands on a corner, looking out of place amidst the
          glistening neon and bustle of Asian faces. He peers anxiously
          down the.street, checks his watch, all anticipation             -
          - when something is wrapped around his eyes. He's startled,
          tugs it off and spins to find "S" smiling back at him.
          if S I'll
          I bought you a present.
          She drapes the scarf around his neck. It's all striped,
          bright colors                                                   - all the more funky against his dark suit.
                                                                          I knew it. You look smashing.

                                                                          JONATHAN

          She laughs                                                      - then notices how tense he seems.

                                                                          ,/Sâ
          Are you all right?

          JONATHAN.
          I guess. I got a call-before yours                              - I'm
          not sure if it was real, or if it was even
          meant for me - but there was a woman who
          sounded like she was being - I don't know,
          hurt. Maybe worse.
          "S" seems instantly on edge. Something about this scares her.
          If SIP
          You don't know who she was?

          JONATHAN
          (shakes his head)
          It could've been a prank.
          (notices).
          Now you're the one who looks scared.

          ..Sâ
          No, it's just                                                   - it sounds creepy, that's

          EXT. CHINATOWN -- AN ALLEY -- NIGHT

          A makeshift street market, everything from fish and meat to
          cheap electronics for sale in cramped stands. Jonathan and
          "S" walk arm in arm through the packed crowd, like a couple.
          Jonathan looks like we've never seen him before: a
          fascination with everything around him, especially her.
          They pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets, including a
          small metallic wind-up toy of a duck riding a bicycle.

          Â«S"
          He's so cute! What's his name?

          Duck On Bike.
          "S" beams like it's the greatest name ever.

          INT. A RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN - LATE NIGHT

          An intimate place, Jonathan and "S" are the only patrons at
          this late hour. They sit across from each other, grinning at
          "Duck On Bike" as it totters across the table, trips over a
          chopstick and flails on its side.
          /t S â
          Oh, poor Duck On Bike!
          She uprights the toy and it keeps on moving across the table.

          JONATHAN
          You gotta respect him; he just keeps at
          it.
          A WAITER arrives and sets down a laminated menu - entirely in
          Chinese. "S" points to the characters like an expert.
          J! $ Ft
          We'll have this... and this... oh, and
          let's try one of these. Thank you.

          Jonathan gazes at her a beat.

          â$â
          Is that a good thing?

          JONATHAN
          Ever since that night on the subway - I
          haven't stopped thinking about you.
          She lowers.her eyes.

          JONATHAN
          Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.
          She slowly looks up again, touched.

          âSâ
          Are you always so honest?

          JONATHAN
          No.

          Jonathan's look, 'why not?'

          "S.â
          You're in the sex club! Another anonymous
          guy looking for anonymous action. I'm not

          In between the mindless shtupping?

          JONATHAN
          And sometimes during.
          She laughs. The waiter brings them their drinks.

          JONATHAN
          So how come you got involved in the club?
          She frowns slightly, thinks.

          Isn't who we are right now so much more
          interesting than where we've come from?

          JONATHAN
          Sure... but that didn't really answer my
          question.
          She reaches over and takes his hand, holds it tenderly.
          â S of
          I know it seems like I'm holding out on
          you, but I'm not. It's just                                  - I turned
          thirty this year, and I made this vow to
          live only in the present. And it's good,
          you know? And yes, maybe it's because
          there are things in my past I don't care
          to think about - but that's the same for
          everyone, isn't it?
          He nods, still holding hands, loving every moment of this.
          is S . â
          I like you. I hope you like me. Can't that
          be enough?
          Jonathan smiles, completely disarmed by her. The waiter
          brings their food and goes.

          JONATHAN
          I wasn't asking for an autobiography, you
          know. I was just curious.

          to give it a try. For various reasons, it
          suits my present situation.

          JONATHAN
          You mean the intimacy without intricacy.

          âS . 110
          It has its merits. At least I thought it
          did... until you came along.
          He beams, gazing at her. Blushing, she starts in on the food.
          Outside we can hear rain starting to fall...

          EXT. CHINATOWN RESTAURANT - LATER

          Jonathan and "S" step out into pouring rain, pause under the
          shabby awning. Waiters inside are putting chairs on tables.
          She fishes in her coat and pulls out a PACK OF GUM. The
          wrapper is entirely in Chinese. She offers him a piece.

          JONATHAN
          Oh - no thanks.

          JIS.11
          Don't let the wrapper intimidate you. I
          buy it at a store nearby. It has ginseng
          in it, you know, for energy. It's not bad,
          though it sort of tastes like hairspray.
          She chews her gum. He watches her; the jaw line, her lips.
          She looks at him and smiles, but there's something behind it:
          a sadness. Almost an uneasiness.

          JONATHAN
          Hey, are you all right?

          "SÂ
          I don't want to complicate your life.

          JONATHAN
          Too late.                                                       -- I want all the complication
          you've got.
          She gazes at him, blinks back her emotions.
          it Sc,
          Your glasses. They're fogging up.
          She reaches out and gently removes his glasses.

          CONTINUED:
          She wipes the lenses, then peering into his eyes, slowly
          leans in to return them to his face... only she presses her
          lips to his instead, the glasses still in her hand, the kiss
          itself at once tender and passionate.
          She absently lowers her hand, lost in the unexpected
          intensity of the kiss. Embraced, they accidentally step under
          the sheet of water falling off the awning. Jonathan guides
          her back beneath the awning's shelter.
          At S is
          (breathless whisper)
          Maybe you should go...

          JONATHAN
          Maybe you should stay.
          She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately. Again
          they feel the awning's drops, and Jonathan moves to shelter
          them -
          - only "S" leans into him instead, leading him out from under
          the awning, the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces
          as they continue to kiss, the moment purely exhilarating.
          wiping the rain from her face, Jonathan gazes at her, soaked
          and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he's
          just breathed for the very first time.
          Rack focus on a hotel down the street, its neon sign reads:
          "Hotel Lotus."

          strokes her hair. She nuzzles up to him.
          She changes channels. Finds some tennis.

          They watch together.

          So were you any good?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. But I didn't want it enough. The
          guys who make it really need it. I played
          recently, first time in years. I've got

          JONATHAN
          (glancing back)
          Yes?
          She hesitates a cryptic beat - then shakes her head, and
          smiles at him with immense tenderness. Jonathan beams back.
          its . P1
          Hurry, okay?
          He blows her a kiss, she blows one back. Almost in SLOW
          MOTION. She looks stunning.

          INT. HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

          As Jonathan exits the room, hold on the room number:            517.
          Jonathan runs down the long corridor to the ice machine. He's
          giddy with excitement. Passionately alive.
          At the ice machine: an eccentric OLD WOMAN in her night
          attire is slowly filling a bucket. Piece by piece.
          Her weak, gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to
          break her long nails.
          Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration.
          She turns, looks him up and down - he feels a bit self-
          conscious in his robe and bare feet.

          JONATHAN
          Would you like some help, ma'am?

          OLD WOMAN
          I can manage, thank you.
          Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way.
          .Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice.

          59.

          CONTINUED:
          Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key
          card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers.
          We see Room 518                                                 has the DO NOT DISTURB sign on.
          Jonathan arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his
          robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in
          the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light
          blips RED. He tries the card again. Again red. He knocks on
          the door, calls out:

          JONATHAN
          I can't get the card to work.
          He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears
          something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel:
          red.
          He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?... Hello?
          He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting
          anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card
          again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into
          the door. Nothing.
          Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns
          green.                                                          - A millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks
          the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into

          THE ROOM
          He peers up into the small entryway: empty. Ahead of him we
          glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets.
          Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath
          quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket.
          Panicked, he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed,
          splattered all over the crumpled sheets...
          Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just
          as he senses something behind him and BANG!                     - something hits
          him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of
          potatoes.

          BLACKOUT.

          TWO HOURS LATER
          THE ICE BUCKET on the floor. The ice has melted, a pool of
          water seeps out... follow the flow to arrive at Jonathan's

          fingers... slowly responding to the cold water... The TV
          playing a different film now.
          OVERHEAD OF JONATHAN lies on the floor. He groans a little.
          Rubs the back of his head. Checks his hand for blood.
          Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet,
          shaky. He looks around the room. It's EMPTY. No sign of "S."
          He runs into the bathroom. Also empty.
          Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING
          DOOR between this room and the next: LOCKED.
          He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every
          trace of her is gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets
          are still crumpled, only there's no blood an here on them.
          He runs to the window looks down at the street. It's four in
          the morning, no one around.

          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

          Tripping over his own legs, Jonathan runs barefoot down the
          corridor. He rounds a corner, another stretch of narrow
          corridor. O.S. we hear the muted DING of an elevator.
          Jonathan tears off in its direction...
          He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are
          located. He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor
          indicator overhead: "4" slowly creeps to "3".

          INT. STAIRWELL

          His bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each
          floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip
          their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing
          to the 2nd floor landing. He clutches his head, gets up and
          continues to dash down...
          BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he
          lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in

          THE LOBBY
          His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around
          his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild-
          eyed and shaking. It's utterly vacant at this hour, the only
          sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles' "Yesterday."

          SLAM! OF JONATHAN'S HAND ON THE FRONT DESK

          The Asian Clerk working there snaps his head up with a
          startled gasp. Jonathan barely manages to breathe the word:

          JONATHAN

          INT. HOTEL LOTUS -                                            5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

          Two hotel SECURITY GUARDS take the lead as they near room
          517, Jonathan trailing, breathless and shaken...

          JONATHAN
          .I saw blood on the bed and then someone
          hit me. When I came to, she was gone.

          SECURITY 1
          This woman you were with. What's her name?
          Jonathan looks blank, his mind racing.

          SECURITY 2
          Sir?

          JONATHAN
          I don't know.
          (off their looks)
          It starts with an 'S'. I think.

          SECURITY 2
          Was shea prostitute?

          JONATHAN
          No! No, she's just a person. A friend.

          SECURITY 2
          A friend with no name.

          JONATHAN
          Of course she has a name! I just don't -
          we have to find her - something must have
          happened to her!

          INT. ROOM 517

          The two Security Guards are eyeing the bed.

          SECURITY 1
          I thought you said there was blood?

          JONATHAN
          I told you, whoever did this must have
          cleaned it up while I was out.

          Jonathan freezes, eyes darting to the night stand.

          JONATHAN
          My wallet and keys                                          - they're gone! They
          were right here...
          He looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit lies.    His
          SCARF is gone too.

          SECURITY 2
          Maybe she took them.

          JONATHAN
          What?!

          SECURITY 2
          It happens.

          JONATHAN
          She didn't do this, okay?! Something
          happened to her! You don't understand, we
          were... Wait!
          He sees something on the floor between the bed and night
          stand. He runs to to pick it up: a Chinese Gum Wrapper.

          JONATHAN
          This                                                        -- this was hers...
          Jonathan clutches it desperately, the lone trace of her
          existence. The Guards exchange a look like he's INSANE.

          SECURITY                                                    1
          Sir - are these your clothes?
          Jonathan nods absently.

          SECURITY 1
          How about putting them on.

          INT. LOBBY - LATER

          Jonathan arrives to find DETECTIVE RUSSO                    (female, mid-30s)
          waiting by reception with a UNIFORMED OFFICER. Seeing
          Jonathan, she sizes him up a moment, then approaches him.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, I'm Detective Russo.

          INT. POLICE PRECINCT - RUSSO'S DESK - LATER

          Still shaken, Jonathan sits in a wooden chair across from
          Russo, amidst the din and traffic of the precinct.

          RUSSO

          (SCEPTICAL)
          And you don't know anything about her.
          Where she works? Where she lives?

          JONATHAN
          I told you how we met.

          RUSSO
          Through a sex group.
          Her flat words hang in the air. He guiltily avoids her eyes.

          RUSSO
          Does this group have a name?

          JONATHAN
          I don't                                                         -- it's not like that.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, I spoke to the desk clerk. She
          only recalled seeing you check in.

          JONATHAN
          That's... that's the way it works.

          RUSSO
          All right. But now you're telling me that
          in addition to this mystery woman, there
          was another individual in the room?

          JONATHAN
          Not at first -- look, I know how it
          sounds, but I'm telling you, whoever hit
          me must have - I don't know -- taken her.
          Maybe even...
          He stops himself, shuddering to think of the implications.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, have you had - experiences
          like this before? Taking any sort of
          medication?

          JONATHAN
          I'm not crazy, okay?! A woman vanished
          back there! There was blood all over the
          goddamn bed!
          He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when A
          CELL PHONE RINGS: it's Russo's. She pauses, struck by the
          genuine desperation in Jonathan's face. She finally picks up.

          Yeah.
          (glances at Jonathan)
          No, I don't think it's necessary... Right.
          She hangs up and turns to Jonathan. He looks away, barely
          able to contain his devastation.

          JONATHAN
          What am I supposed to do?
          An awkward silence, then:

          RUSSO
          If you want to file a report regarding the
          items she -
          (corrects herself)
          - the items you claim were stolen...
          Jonathan shakes his head, crushed and exasperated.

          JONATHAN
                                                                          I'd like to go now. Is that all right? Can
          I just                                                          - can I go?

          EXT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          Jonathan climbs up to the landing, fishes in the dark for a
          boot. He tips it, a SPARE KEY falls out. As he starts back
          down, he feels something in his coat pocket. He reaches in,
          finds "Duck On Bike" where he'd pocketed it.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          Jonathan stands motionless beneath the shower, face buried in
          his elbow, completely overwhelmed by his loss and longing.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          Jonathan enters, wanders for his bed -- when he pauses,
          staring at his dresser. He approaches, peering down at
          something that's caught his eye...
          HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a
          small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy
          base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the
          exposed area                                                    - as if the trophy had recently been moved.
          Jonathan swallows tensely, staring at the cryptic dust mark -
          (SOUND ADVANCE) BANG! of a file cabinet drawer yanked open in

          A SPARE BEDROOM
          Used for storage, including an old, gun-metal grey filing
          cabinet. Phone to his ear, Jonathan rapidly sifts through
          faded file folders crammed with papers and documents.

          JONATHAN                                                          (INTO PHONE)

          how soon could you-... Fine.
          He opens a file: it's where he keeps his passport. He stuffs
          it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a folder marked
          "CREDIT CARDS." Sorting through old statements, he finds the
          line: "To report a card lost or stolen..."

          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S HAGGARD FACE in the mirror of a medicine
          cabinet as he pulls it open. Be fishes around, finds what
          he's looking for: a SMALL BLACK CANNISTER for film. He pops
          the cap to reveal a fat roll of emergency money.
          Jonathan exits the bathroom, crosses the living room to the
          foyer, where we find a LOCKSMITH finishing changing the lock.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Jonathan lies awake, staring at his muted TV, his face tear-
          stained, his eyes clouded.

          JONATHAN (V.O.)
          This is Jonathan Messer. I won't be able
          to come in today. I'm - pretty ill...
          'Duck on Bike' sits on his nightstand next to his glasses.

          Jonathan seated, resting against the window, drifting off

          Jonathan jerks awake. A few stares from nearby passengers.

          EXT. CANAL STREET - DAY

          Jonathan emerges from underground to hectic Chinatown. What
          once felt romantic now feels cold and exclusionary, a
          bustling mix of ASIANS and map-clutching TOURISTS. He surveys
          the area,-overwhelmed, eyes searching for anything resembling
          a clue. Foreign faces return only cold, blank stares.

          INT. CHINESE MARKET - DAY

          Cramped and dingy. Jonathan makes his way to the counter,
          where an OLD WOMAN sits smoking. He holds up the wrapper.

          JONATHAN
          I was told you sell this gum here?
          The Old Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a
          candy display. In one box is the same gum.

          JONATHAN
          A woman - a white woman - buys this brand
          of gum. I need to find-
          The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy Chinese.

          JONATHAN
          I'm sorry, I don't                                              -- Do you know the
          woman I'm talking about? A white woman...?

          Jonathan spins around to find a CHINESE GIRL.(13) in a smock.

          JONATHAN
          Can you ask if she knows the name of the
          white woman who buys this gum?
          The Girl questions the old woman in rapid Chinese. She takes.
          a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The girl
          nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan.

          GIRL
          She says they sell that gum in practically
          every store in Chinatown.

          The Receptionist nods, points across the lobby to Detective
          Russo. Jonathan looks very worried.

          INT. M.E.'S OFFICE                                              - A RICKETY ELEVATOR

          The elevator descends with an unnerving rattle as Jonathan
          rides down with Russo.

          RUSSO
          The body came in late last night, although
          time of death's still unclear. She was
          found in a taxi: driver was in a .coffee
          shop on his break, came back to his cab
          and there she was in the back seat.
          The elevator shudders to a metallic stop.

          RUSSO
          Her purse was recovered from a dumpster
          about a block away, so we've got a name.
          Jonathan tenses as the elevator doors BANG OPEN.

          RUSSO
          Simone Forester.
          Jonathan looks sick with fear.

          INT. MORGUE

          Russo leads Jonathan into the harsh fluorescent lights of the
          morgue. A MEDICAL EXAMINER                                      (50s) looks up from a deli
          sandwich, takes one last bite and waves them over.
          As they approach, Jonathan notices the TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS
          stationed down here. They recognize Russo, nod in recognition
          - and eye Jonathan with hard, careful stares.

          SAME -"'MOMENTS LATER
          The M.E. stands over agurney, casually lifts the sheet
          that's been draped over the body. We glimpse a slender foot.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN beside Russo. He turns instantly pale, lip
          quivering as he stares in disbelief, our CAMERA SLOWLY COMING
          OVER HIS SHOULDER to get a look at

          CONTINUED:
          THE VICTIM'S FACE: it's not "S". But we do recognize her.
          It's the Blonde: the first woman he'd been with, the one he'd
          passed without a word in an office some days later.
          She looks the same, only death-pale and naked - and her neck
          marred by a thin, discolored line where she's been strangled.

          RUSSO
          Mr Messer...?
          He tries to speak, but can hardly breathe, let alone answer.

          RUSSO
          Was this the woman you were with last
          night?
          She frowns, suspicious of Jonathan's hesitation. His tense
          eyes whip across the morgue: the two cops still idling there.
          They're out of earshot, but their mere presence amps tension.
          Angle on the guns in their holsters. The handcuffs dangling --

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer?

          JONATHAN
          No - she's not. Not last night... no.
          Russo studies his strained expression a suspicious beat.

          EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER BUILDING - SHORT TIME LATER

          Jonathan exits behind Russo as they step onto the sidewalk.

          RUSSO
          I figured it was a long shot. The only
          reason I called you down is she was last
          seen with a man in the bar of the Hudson
          hotel.

          JONATHAN
          (suddenly tenses)
          The Hudson?

          RUSSO
          You mentioned this group of yours meets up
          at various hotels. I thought it was worth
          a shot.
          Russo glances up at him, trying to read him - something about
          his reaction not sitting right with her.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, is there anything else you
          want to tell me?
          Nervous and torn, Jonathan manages to shake his head.

          EXT. MORGUE/ STREET - NIGHT

          Jonathan exiting the morgue, talking low into his cell phone.

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt, it's me. I need to talk to you.
          Call me, OK? Please.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LLP - LOBBY - MORNING

          A pleasant RECEPTIONIST smiles up from her expansive desk.

          RECEPTIONIST
          May I help you?
          Jonathan is standing across from her.

          JONATHAN
          Yes, I need to get in contact with one of
          your attorneys, Wyatt Bose - it's
          extremely important. He's working out of
          the London office right now. If I could
          speak to his assistant or someone who'd
          know how-to reach him immediately...

          RECEPTIONIST
          Of course. Just a minute.
          The Receptionist types into her PHONE SYSTEM. She shakes her
          head, confused.

          JONATHAN
          B-o-s-e. First name Wyatt.

          RECEPTIONIST
          Wyatt with a 'Y'?

          from worth and Berman.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - CORRIDOR

          Jonathan walks alongside Ms. Pomerantz.

          POMERANTZ
          Are you sure you have the right firm?

          JONATHAN
          Yes                                                             -- yes, I'm                         --- He works here. I've seen

          POMERANTZ
          When was this?

          JONATHAN
          A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here.
          He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern
          masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion.

          POMERANTZ
          I don't know what's going on, but I can
          assure you, there is nobody here named-

          JONATHAN
          I've seen him in the halls                                      - for Chrissake
          we smoked pot in the conference room!
          Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns, when Jonathan spots a LAWYER -

          FLASH INSERT -= COFFEE LOUNGE
          This Lawyer and another laughing at Wyatt's punch line.
          Jonathan runs over to the Lawyer, grabs the man's arm.

          Thank God. Look, I'm trying to find Wyatt.

          Jonathan smiles in greeting... but Wyatt just nods coolly.

          LAWYER
          I crack jokes with a lot of people.

          JONATHAN
          Hold on, you're telling me you don't--

          LAWYER
          Hey - easy with the hands, okay?
          Jonathan realizes he's got the man's sleeve in his fist. He
          lets go, spins back to Ms. Pomerantz.

          JONATHAN
          He said he was in London with Mr.
          Rutherford, paperinga -

          Jonathan spins to find Ms. Pomerantz scowling at him. A beat.

          MS. POMERANTZ
          Mr. Rutherford is presently recovering
          from hip surgery. In New Jersey.
          Jonathan glances around, to find everyone - lawyers,
          assistants, mail clerks                                         - all staring at him.

          INT. WYATT'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

          Breathless, Jonathan bolts up a set of stairs, knocks on a
          door. No answer. He knocks harder. From within we hear a set
          of FOOTSTEPS. Sound of a lock turning, the door is opened...

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt -
          .by a MAN in his early 60's, his WIFE behind him; both
          strike us as wealthy, downtown patron-of-the-arts types.

          In this building? He must be new. See,
          we've been out of town the past2 months -

          Not in this building - in this apartment.

          Young man, we've owned this apartment
          going on thirty years now.

          JONATHAN
          But... I was right-here-with him...
          The Man takes a step back, catching his wife's equally wary
          expression, his hand making for the chain lock.

          JONATHAN

          (DESPERATE)
          Wait!! That painting there, it's                              a Gerhard

          downstairs?

          MAN
          Unless it was in Italian I doubt he got
          very far.
          Jonathan steps back, looking like he's losing his mind.

          Jonathan stumbles out, breathing hard as he tries to grapple
          with this                                                      - when he slams up against a man's shirtfront. Two
          hands grasp his arms, we glimpse a pair of black wingtips      -
          - and whip tilt up to the papery face of "Herr Kleiner"        (aka
          Mr. Moretti).

          "HERR KLEINER"
          Sono spiacente.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - EVENING

          Jonathan sits slumped against a window, the world around him
          is ceasing to make sense. Across the aisle, a YOUNG BOHEMIAN
          COUPLE sit side by side, her headon his shoulder. On
          Jonathan's face there's a sense of loss that is almost
          overwhelming.
          Jonathan takes the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper from his
          pocket, smoothes it in his hands, stares down at it with a
          look of longing...
          . when his eyes suddenly widen. He sees something inside,
          something he hadn't noticed. He unfolds it to reveal two
          words written in a feminine hand on the white underside:
          I'm sorry
          Jonathan quickly looks up, as if expecting someone else to
          share in this haunting discovery. of course, no one does.
          He stares back. down at it, bewildered, stunned - chilled.

          EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CANAL ST., CHINATOWN - LATER

          Jonathan runs out from the subway station. Determined, he
          walks down Canal street, his eyes suddenly land on a COPY
          SHOP across.
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we see something click in his head -

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - LOBBY - LATE DAY

          Jonathan steps off the elevator, heads straight for the
          Receptionist. She immediately looks nervous.

          We do all freelancers, it's policy.

          Oh - I'm not sure I'm allowed to-

          JONATHAN
          You have to.
          She looks at him', sees his desperation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan is flipping through the stack of photocopies, then
          halts on one. He stares at it. The Receptionist peers over.

          RECEPTIONIST
          That's him? He was real cute. Only he
          wasn't a lawyer. He was a systems analyst,
          I think. He was here for a few days to
          work on the computers.
          RECEPTIONIST'S POV: of the photocopy in Jonathan's hand. It's
          of a Massachusetts Driver's License. Staring back up at us is
          Wyatt's smiling face.

          RECEPTIONIST
          I thought you said his name was Wyatt?
          PAN TO THE NAME beside the photo: Sansky. WilliamR.
          Jonathan is already running for the EXIT.

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as an internet search
          engine runs the name: "Bansky, William." A page of some 200+
          matches is returned. Jonathan readies himself, then dives in.
          Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of
          William Bansky's Massachusetts driver's license. We see
          Detective Russo's business card resting a few inches away.

          ON JONATHAN - MOMENTS LATER
          Checking URLs site by site. He finally pauses on one. It's an
          article from the Boston Herald. The headline: "POLICE HAVE
          FEW CLUES TO YOUNG EXECUTIVE'S DISAPPEARANCE." As Jonathan

          ORIG. FROM CHICAGO -- $$ TROUBLE
          He sticks the post-it to the photocopy of Bansky's ID. He
          steps back, stares at it a beat - when he notices something
          on his desk,,resting under the phone: a manila file folder.
                                                                          He frowns at it - clearly out of place here. He picks the
          file up, opens it... to a series of                             8X10                                                        photographs?
          Heart racing nervously, he takes one out: it's of Jonathan
          standing in the Plaza lobby by the Eloise portrait. Confused,
          he quickly flips to the next one: in it, a Blonde now stands
          there with him -- the Blonde found murdered. Simone Forester.
          Jonathan's rapidly breathing as he shuffles through more
          photos. They're in sequence, taken by telephoto lens.
          Jonathan and Simone Forester getting in the elevator. Opening
          the room door. Undressing. Screwing. In one, Jonathan has his
          hands on her neck...
          He's sweating with anxiety- when suddenly the phone rings,
          startling him. He eyes it warily, then slowly picks up.

          Oh - right, I was just - checking in, to
          see if you had any leads...

          RUSSO
          On that missing girl of yours? No, not
          yet.

          JONATHAN
          (anxious to hang up)
          Oh - okay, thanks-

          RUSSO                                                      (O.S.)
          Are you sure you didn't know Simone
          Forester?
          The PHOTOS of Simone in his hands, Jonathan tenses...

          JONATHAN
          I told you before -

          RUSSO                                                      (O.S.)
          I remember what you said.
          (an unsettling silence)
          And you weren't at the Hudson two nights
          ago?

          JONATHAN
          I don't                                                    -- why are you-

                                                                     RUSSO             (O.S.)
          Turns out among credit card charges made
          that night, there was one with your name.
          The card was declined.

          JONATHAN
          I cancelled them all, the day they got
          stolen.

          RUSSO (O.S.)
          I see. I figured it didn't mean much -
          cards move quickly. It just struck me, you
          know.. The coincidence.
          Jonathan can hear the suspicion in her pause.

          RUSSO                                                      (O.S.)
          By the way, the morgue confirmed
          strangulation as cause of death. He found
          trace fibres of Kevlar in her neck wound.

          JONATHAN
          Kevlar?

          RUSSO (O.S.)
          It's used in certain kinds of rope and
          string.
          Jonathan's eyes suddenly go wide; whip pan with his gaze   to
          the hall closet door.

          Thought I lost you for a second.

          (PAUSE)
          Well, I won't keep you. You have a good
          night.
          Jonathan slowly hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the
          hall closet as he paces toward it, throws open the door.
          In the far corner rests his racket bag. He grabs it, yanks
          open the zipper... his face draining of all remaining color
          as he peers into his empty racket ba                           . His racket is gone.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan pacing the floor, paranoid. He holds Detective
          Russo's card. Knows he should call back. He abruptly reaches
          for the phone, and dials... another number.

          JONATHAN
          I know, okay? I know your name isn't Wyatt
          Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I
          know you're trying to frame me for it, so -
          so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And
          where is she?! If you hurt her I swear to
          God I'll...
          Jonathan falters, unsure where he's going with this and
          realizing he's now talking to himself.

          Jonathan hesitates, hits the Star key. A new BEEP. Harder:

          JONATHAN
          It's me. I need to talk to you.
          He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something.
          Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the
          room, grabs the nearest blunt object: his tennis trophy.
          QUICKLY CUT SHOTS of Jonathan searching his apartment, his
          trophy raised as a makeshift weapon.

          He finally halts, uneasy but satisfied there's no one else
          here - when his home phone rings, startling him. RING...
          RING... RING... Jonathan hesitates. His machine picks up:

          JONATHAN'S ANSWERING MACHINE
          This is Jonathan. Please leave a message.
          BEEEEP. A moment of hiss                                       - then:

          MALE VOICE (O.S.
          Jonathan?
          Jonathan whips to the phone - it sounds like Wyatt ---

          PETERSON                                                       (O.S.)

          I understand you were out today. I left
          messages on your cell but never heard
          back, so I thought I'd try you at home.
          He slowly lowers his trophy as he listens, staring out the
          window at the dark night and empty street below.

          PETERSON                                                       (O.S.)

          Clute Nichols are expecting you...

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

          Jonathan sits in a crowded car, dressed for work.

          PETERSON                                                       (V.0.)
          They're our biggest client, so needless to
          say, make them your top priority...
          Jonathan takes out the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper. He
          stares at it with a look of longing: this is his Priority-

          EXT. CHINATOWN -- DAY

          A series of shots: Jonathan asking around about "S." The
          street vendors. The receptionist at the hotel. The waiter at
          the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads.
          Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a
          discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a
          headline: "STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC." The
          photo is of Simone Forester.

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS BROKERAGE - CORRIDORS                        - LATE DAY

          Intensely preoccupied, Jonathan walks alone past assistants
          and execs. In his eyes a sense of paranoia, a mistrust of
          every strange face.

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

          Isolated behind yet another wall of glass, Jonathan just
          stares bleary-eyed at his laptop, unable to work.

          EXT. CLUTE NICHOLS BUILDING - NIGHT

          Jonathan exits, starts toward the sidewalk -- but hears
          something: sandpaper SHUFFLE of shoes on pavement. Be spins     --
          No one there. Just one of many large stone pillars adorning
          the building. Jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar,
          wavering. He steps closer, trying to glimpse behind it -
          RING! of his cell-phone breaks the stillness. RING... RING...
          He catches his breath, quickly picks up. A silent beat.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE                                                 (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?... Hello?
          He hangs up, chilled. Turns again to the pillar, steps closer
          - no sound. He hesitates... then turns and walks off.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

          People heading home from work. Jonathan among them, utterly
          desolate. Sliding his MetroCard, he suddenly feels watched
          again. He spins, peers anxiously behind him. Only strange
          faces passing through turnstiles.

          INT. SUBWAY STATION - CORRIDOR

          A narrow, curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti.
          Jonathan keeps a quick pace, feeling vulnerable.
          We lag back, following him from an ANONYMOUS POV; glance up
          at a sign for stairs to the N & R trains.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

          Jonathan is waiting for his train, eyes nervously glancing
          around, still feeling watched -
          When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the
          opposite platform, waiting for a train. She casually turns
          her head, and Jonathan's eyes go wide...

          It's "S."
          Jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks;
          he can't believe he's seeing her again...
          . when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run.
          Confused, Jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform.

          JONATHAN
          wait! Wait, right there!
          Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her.
          He looks around, hears the distant: .nimble of afar. off train,
          and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him
          capable of: he jumps onto the tracks!
          He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly
          scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails,
          eyes darting along the track, anxious to avoid the third
          rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he
          races for

          THE CENTER DIVIDER
          He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up.
          He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one lane
          of track separating him from the platform she was standing on
          - only she's no longer there?
          He scans the people waiting, no sign of "S" among them - and
          then suddenly he spots her, heading for the exits.

          JONATHAN

          STOP!
          She glances back, utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing
          on the center divider, feet soaked in muck.
          Neither speaks for a moment, just staring at each other
          across the solitary track. Then:

          JONATHAN
          I thought you were dead!
          She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. And
          all at once he's hit with a crushing realization:

          JONATHAN
          You are in on this, aren't you?!
          She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion -
          then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again.

          Through the club. He caught me trying to
          steal his wallet.
          Jonathan looks confused; she's struggling to stay composed
          but looks like she could break down at any moment.

          âSâ
          He asked if I wanted to make some real
          money. All I had to do was get involved
          with you, and not ask any questions.
          Jonathan just stares, devastated.

          JONATHAN
          So everything between us - was nothing?
          She fights back tears.

          ., S
          No - no... After that first night I tried
          to call it off, he said he'd kill me if I
          didn't go through with it.

          JONATHAN
          Go through with what?

          âC,.
          The plan. Get you out of the hotel room,
          slip out and meet up later for my money.
          Only I ran instead. He's been looking for
          me ever since. I have to leave the city -

          JONATHAN
          Then why didn't you?

          SÂ
          Because I needed to see you again. I
          needed to be sure you were all right.
          Despite his conflicting emotions, Jonathan is moved          by   this.
          S,f
          I didn't know how to find you - you were

          Jonathan had taken that. I remembered you

          Did you go to the police?

          JONATHAN
          I can't. He's framing me for murder.
          What?

          JONATHAN
          He killed a woman from the club, someone
          I'd been with.
          "S" is shocked., instantly terrified. Clearly she had no idea.
          I/ S$f
          Jonathan, you have to leave! Do you
          understand? You need to get the hell out
          of here, he's going to kill you!
          The roar of the incoming train is growing LOUDER...
          Don't you understand? He's going to kill -
          - when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out... and
          swipes "S" out of Jonathan's view.
          Jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its
          passengers prevent him from getting a look at her. Just then
          the TRAIN DOORS OPEN WITH THE NOISE of passengers getting on
          and off. Panicked, Jonathan cranes his neck, trying to see
          her through the windows.

          JONATHAN

          STOP!
          He boards the train; using it as a bridge, he pushes through
          passengers, desperate for an open door to the other side.

          He jumps off the train, in the direction she'd been walking
          -- only she's nowhere in sight. Jonathan spins frantically as
          the doors close and he hears the TRAIN START TO PULL AWAY.
          He runs alongside the train - desperately searching for a
          glimpse of her                                                  - no sign of her in any of the windows...

          the rear observation window, her hand pressed to the pane,
          her tearful expression bidding him a heartbreaking goodbye.
          He stumbles to a devastated halt, eyes pleading vainly as he
          watches her recede, framed by the rectangle of window,

          Only a few scattered travellers this late. "S" slumps into a
          seat, takes a breath - and starts to quietly break down. She
          shuts her eyes, tries to stifle her sobbing.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BUILDING - MAILBOXES - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan yanks open his mailbox. Empty. As he heads upstairs,
          there's a change in his face: a newly forged determination.
          He takes out his cell phone, dials. The other end immediately
          picks up:

          COMPUVOICE                                                      (O.S.)

          Jonathan hangs up. Takes an angry breath. Presses redial.

          WORTH-AND-BERMAN-VOICE-MAIL-BOX-
          He hangs up again. But his face bears a blank, eerily driven
          expression. He hits redial again as he opens the door to

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT

          Jonathan enters, phone still to his ear.

          COMPUVOICE                                                      (O.S.)

          WORTH-AND-BERMAN-VOICE-
          Jonathan hangs up and just stares at the phone in his hand,
          on the verge of something like a scream. He takes a breath.
          Presses redial once more. Only now it RINGS. Jonathan
          freezes. RING... RING... RING... RING... RING -- a CLICK of
          someone picking up, then SILENCE and faint wisps of static.

          JONATHAN
          Hello...?
          Not a word from the other end. We barely make out BREATHING.

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt? Is that you?
          Jonathan takes a tentative step forward, as if fearful that
          the least movement will cost him this connection.

          JONATHAN
          Say something damn it!
          From the receiver we hear a well-exhaled breath. And then:

          Jonathan SLAMS the phone down, tension in his face joined by
          a new emotion, something closer to. fury.

          JONATHAN
          I'm going to find you.

          EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - STREET - DAY

          Jonathan is heading for the Clute Nichols building, that same
          focused tension on his face -

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Mr. Messer?
          Jonathan is too lost in thought to hear it.

          RUSSO
          I was gonna call, but I was in the area.
          Just doing some follow-up.
          Jonathan tries to mask his uneasiness.

          JONATHAN
          Follow-up?

          RUSSO
          On that missing girl of yours. The.one

          JONATHAN
          No. No luck.

          RUSSO
          I see. That's too bad.
          she studies him a cryptic beat, then smiles flatly.

          RUSSO
          Well, who knows, maybe she'll turn up yet.
          You have a good day, Mr. Messer.
          Jonathan nods tensely, then walks off, feeling her watching
          him from the curb as he goes.

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Employees pass by the glass behind which we see Jonathan - a
          lone figure at his laptop, surrounded by files and post-its.
          Close on Jonathan as he scribbles on a post-it: "Yesterday -
          Beatles?" Widen to find the post-its organized with his usual
          fastidiousness                                                  - only scribbled with words, not numbers:
          "Wyatt Bose = William Bansky" and other random scribblings.
          He's trying to apply his mathematical mind to his crisis,
          hoping to conjure some kind of pattern or logic to it all.
          Reverse angle through the glass: to anyone passing, he looks
          like your typical overly meticulous, isolated auditor.
          Closer on Jonathan as he clutches the table, looks seconds
          away from utterly losing it -- when something suddenly occurs
          to him. He whips around, gaze fixing on

          Jonathan waits anxiously by a Botero sculpture of a rotund
          dog. A young woman in a BLUE PASHMINA approaches.

          INT. THE KITANO - ELEVATOR

          Blue Pashmina enters first, Jonathan follows her into an
          empty elevator. The doors close.

          Do you know Wyatt Bose?

          What about William Bansky? Does that name--
          She darts.for the "Door Open" button, but he blocks her path.

          He does this too - or he did. someone had
          to give him the numbers. Someone let him
          in. If I can-'find who it was that knew
          him, they might know where he's                                 --
          she suddenly kicks him in the shin with a spiked heel.

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN alone at the end of the conference table,

          Jonathan anxiously escorts ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN past the quasi-
          Moroccan motif. Asking her something, he takes out a folded
          paper from his pocket, shows it to her: it's the photocopy of
          Bansky's license with the image of Wyatt's face. She quickly
          shakes her head, her eyes searching for the exit.

          INT. THE LOMBARDY - BAR - NIGHT

          Jonathan trails a TALL WOMAN as she bee-lines for the exit.
          He grabs her arm, thrusts the photocopy into her hands. She
          halts, looks up at him... and tears it in two before handing
          it back and hurrying off, her glare full of paranoia.

          TNT. THE SHERRY-NETHERLAND - LOBBY - NIGHT
          Jonathan rises from a couch to greet YET ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN.
          He gets no more than a few seconds into his question when she
          about-faces without a word. Jonathan has a relentless look in
          his eye. Takes out his cell, calls another number...

          Rapid jump cuts of A DOZEN DIFFERENT WOMEN'S FACES, all

          women occupy the exact same position in frame, only their
          faces and the hotel backgrounds behind them change.

          Room key in hand, Jonathan rides up with a woman in a BLACK
          BUSINESS SUIT - a tall, attractive business-type. Jonathan

          back up at him in scared but clear recognition.

          SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
          Seated on the edge of the made bed, Black Business Suit
          shifts uncomfortably as she lights a cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I was in Chicago on business, a little
          over a year ago. I was out.to dinner with
          one of our Chicago partners,.a man named
          Holloway. That's how I met him.
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we SMASH TO:

          INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          A slightly older man                                            (HOLLOWAY) sits with his back to us.
          Across from him sits Black Business Suit. A YOUNGER MAN steps
          into frame, rests his hand on Holloway's shoulder.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          At first I assumed he was a junior
          executive at their firm. But he wasn't.
          That's not to say he didn't work for
          Holloway, but clearly in a more intimate
          capacity...

          Black Business Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I wasn't shocked. Besides, obviously I'm
          no prude. Even back then, I'd been doing -
          you know, this thing -- for a while.

          INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Wyatt is talking, entertaining his two companions - but
          clearly more focused on Black Business Suit, flirting it up.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          I was simply curious. More so when he
          apologized, explaining that he'd forgotten
          about another engagement.
          Wyatt's knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit's
          thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance...

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I was intrigued. He was intelligent,
          informed about everything from law to art
          to politics. I'd never met anyone so in
          command of his own charm. He said that
          he'd come from nothing, that everything he
          learned, he learned from his tricks. He
          claimed that Holloway was even grooming
          him for a position at his company.
          She lights another cigarette with her old one.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          In a way, I felt for him. But I also
          admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a
          way of making me feel - close to him, you
          know?
          This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely nods.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          So I found myself telling him things..
          Personal things. And, next thing I knew -

          JONATHAN
          You told him. About this.
          A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He seemed fascinated by it. Wanted to know
          all the details.

          (EXHALES)
          I suppose I'd had too much to drink. And I
          was distracted... I was thinking about
          what a great lay he was going to be.

          INT. FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -.SUITE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal
          aggression. She's on all fours, arching lustily, pleasure
          nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes.
          Exhausted, her body goes limp.
          TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of
          real pleasure. She struggles, tries to protest - when his
          hands grip her shoulder blades, thrusting harder, violently
          pinning her down, her sudden fear stifled by the mattress --

          phone. Of course I couldn't say anything
          to Holloway. And Jamie must have known I'd
          never report it to the police.

          (BEAT)
          So I just put the incident out of my mind.
          I all but forgot about it, until one
          night, maybe two months ago -

          Black Business Suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of
          Hearst and A SUITED MAN lingering beneath it... when the man
          looks up. It's Wyatt.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                            (V.0.)
          I almost didn't recognize him. But when I
          did, I suddenly felt very, very scared.
          She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks
          his watch, scans-the lobby with a cool, piercing look.

          BACK TO BLACK BUSINESS SUIT AND JONATHAN IN THE MICHELANGELO

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I left before he saw me.
          She drags on her cigarette, looks off into space.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He must have used my cell phone to get
          into the group.
          (crushes out her cigarette)
          Anyway, that's it. That's all I know.
          She looks around. At the room, the bed. She shudders, rises.

          JONATHAN
          Wait - thank you.
          (off her look)
          Have you ever run into him again?

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          Getz? No. And I don't ever want to.

          JONATHAN
          Getz?

          Bundled in her ski jacket, Solange is closing up her shop for
          the night, stacks of flowers in her arms, when she notices
          Jonathan coming down the front steps.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, you're home early -
          Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the
          overcoat isn't Jonathan. It's Wyatt.

          SOLANGE
          Oh - je suis desole. My mistake.
          Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps.
          Solange watches him walk away, a puzzled look on her face.

          INT. MICHELANGELO - HOTEL BUSINESS CENTER - NIGHT

          Huddled over a computer, Jonathan typing, eyes red from
          exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall:

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          who's James Getz?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.
          on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton
          University alumni. He types in: Getz, James.
          A beat - then: "No match." A long list of G names follows.
          Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Shit.
          Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the
          H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed.
          Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name.
          "Sort no contact information available."
          Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types:
          "Holloway Reed" then decides to add the word "missing."
          An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: "BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED." A head-shot style
          photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize
          from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his
          name: "Reed Holloway."

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan glances up at the Hotel employee manning the desk.

          JONATHAN
          Can I print this out?

          EXT. EIGHTH AVENUE                                              (HELL'S KITCHEN)   - LATE NIGHT

          Porn shops and prostitutes, the streets pulsing with a
          sinister energy. Jonathan is pacing toward the subway,
          reading over the printed article.

          EXT. BROOKLYN - ELEVATED SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan descends the steps to his presently deserted
          neighborhood. O.S. the departure of the subway train is
          joined by the distant.wail of SIRENS.
          Jonathan continues down the block, then pauses. He wrinkles
          his nose, smelling something. He looks up: two blocks away, a
          thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky --

          EXT. JONATHAN'S DUPLEX

          Jonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and
          fire engine curbside -- a fire raging in the lower story of
          his building!
          Running toward the blaze, he speeds past a BLACK BMW parked
          across the street, engine running. It suddenly shifts into
          gear and peels out in a fast turn. Jonathan spins               - something
          about it troubling him - but the BMW is already gone. He
          continues racing toward his building...
          The neon "FLEURS DE SOLANGE" sign crackles and sparks in the
          flame. Through blown out windows, piles of burning flowers
          emit what must be an awful stench.
          Two EMS WORKERS are loading a gurney on which Solange lays,
          burned and half-aware, but alive, when Jonathan rushes over.
          She manages to open her eyes, her voice barely audible:

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan...
          He squeezes her hand as she's lifted into the ambulance.

          JONATHAN'
          (to EMS worker)
          Is she going to be okay?

          EMS WORKER
          Yeah, she'll make it.

          94.

          CONTINUED:
          The ambulance doors SLAM shut. A hand grabs Jonathan's arm.
          He spins                                                        - it's a FIRE WORKER.

          JONATHAN
          I live here.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor. Suit jacket over
          his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker.
          His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its
          hinges. The place looks like it's been turned upside down,
          furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls.

          FIRE WORKER
          Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat.
          Better get your valuables together.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          still in shock, he tosses random clothes in a gym bag - "Duck
          on Bike" too.

          JONATHAN
          (calls out)
          How did it start?

          FIRE WORKER (O.S.)
          We're not sure. Maybe a bad fuse.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM

          Jonathan opens his medicine cabinet, takes out his small film
          cannister, uncaps it to see how much money he has left. Not
          very much. He stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket.

          INT. SPARE BEDROOM

          Jonathan opens his old gunmetal-gray filing cabinet, then
          pops open his briefcase, trying to decide what to take.
          He finds a file marked "Bank Statements," pulls it, about to
          toss it in his briefcase - when he stops, something about its
          contents ---
          CLOSE ON THE FILE. Stuffed with paper. But not bank
          statements... Copies and copies of photographs of Jonathan
          with Simone Forester. Some we've seen, some new.
          Jonathan hunts through more files, his breathless nausea
          telling us the contents of each and every file have been
          swapped out with photos.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          95.

          CONTINUED:
          He opens another at random - and freezes: it's a photo of
          Jonathan and "S" walking in Chinatown. He scans through
          others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel
          Lotus...
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN, terrified by the horrific implication -

          FIRE WORKER                                                     (O.S.)
          Mr. Messer?
          Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the
          doorway. He quickly shuts the file.

          JONATHAN
          Just                                                            - give me a minute.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

          A paranoid-looking Jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed
          near to bursting. The tired Fire Worker looks up impatiently.

          FIRE WORKER
          That everything?
          Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little
          evidence there is of a life. A wrenching sense of isolation.

          JONATHAN
          I guess it is.

          FIRE WORKER
          You got someone you can stay with?

          INT. A SEEDY HOTEL LOBBY - DOWNTOWN - PRE-DAWN

          The sort of decrepit no-tell motel frequented by hookers and
          junkies. Jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through
          steel mesh at. the NIGHT CLERK.

          NIGHT CLERK
          It's fifty for the night.
          Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what
          he discovers are his last three                                 $20s.

          INT. SEEDY HOTEL - ROOM - PRE-DAWN

          Even more depressing than the lobby: bars on the windows,
          stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of
          paid sex bleed in. Somewhere a bottle smashes.

          96.

          CONTINUED:
          Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents
          onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and
          "S." She's smiling up at him.
          EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in
          time, at once haunting and heartbreaking.
          He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune
          article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway
          ("BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED"). His eyes
          drift to the article, and something suddenly occurs to him -
          FLASH ON: THE PHOTOGRAPH IN "WYATT'S.BROWNSTONE" of Wyatt
          with bleached hair styled in a loose spike --
          IN THE ARTICLE'S PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical
          look.-His eyes move to the date of the article: "May 17."

          CUT TO:
          Jonathan on the phone, a business card in hand.

          OFFICE ON PHONE
          Boston Police, how can I direct your call?
          Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him:

          JONATHAN
                                                                                                      This is Detective Russo, NYPD, badge
          number 274655.                                                                                                                     1   just need some

          Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally -

          OFFICER ON PHONE
          Well?

          JONATHAN
          You've got a case, a missing person named
          William Bansky. I'm wondering if you can
          tell me the date he was last seen?

          OFFICER ON PHONE
          Hold a sec.

          (PAUSE)
          Bansky, William, last seen... May                              17.
          Jonathan's eyes return to the Holloway article                 ("BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED:), dated "May 17."

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          That's it, thanks.
          Jonathan quickly hangs up, equally encouraged and chilled by
          the connection he's made.
          TILT DOWN to a post-it, on which he's scribbled: "BOSE =
          BANSKY = HOLLOWAY." To this he adds: "= JAMES GETZ"

          INT. CHASE MANHATTAN BANK - MORNING

          A line of customers stare mutely up at plasma tv screens
          above - except for Jonathan, unshaven, suit wrinkled, face
          all anxious tension.

          SAME - TELLER'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan slides his passport through the window's metal tray,
          to the TELLER                                                   (40s) working behind three inches of glass. The
          Teller examines the passport, then slides it back.

          TELLER
          M'kay, if you'll just swipe your ATM card.
          She gestures to a small punch pad to Jonathan's right.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, my card was stolen.

          TELLER
          Mmm'kay... do you see those two taupe
          colored telephones over there? Just pick
          up either one and you'll be connected with
          our automated system.

          JONATHAN
          The thing is, I already used your
          automated system and...look, this
          passport's all I have left, it's the only
          thing proves who I am and now I'm down to
          like my last ten dollars here, so...
          Jonathan's cool is cracking. The Teller wrinkles her brow.

          TELLER
          Mm'kay, if you press "0" on either phone?
          A customer service representative will -

          JONATHAN
          Give me a goddamn break.

          TELLER
          Sir, there's no need for profanity.

          JONATHAN
          (loses it)
          Oh no? In the last few days I've seen a
          woman I thought might be dead turn up
          alive and a woman I assumed was alive turn
          up dead, both at the hands of a guy about
          whom everything I know is apparently a
          lie. I've had my building set on fire, my
          neighbor nearly killed, and my apartment
          ransacked. So please forgive my language,
          but it's been one fuck of a week.
          The stunned Teller stares back at him slack-jawed.

          JONATHAN
          Look, I know I'm just another face on this
          side of the glass, I get that. But I'm
          begging you, as one human being to
          another, please let me into your life just
          long enough to help me out here. Please.
          The Teller stares back at him a beat - and nods.
          She starts quickly typing into her monitor, finally looks up.

          TELLER
          I'm showing that card as having been sent
          out four days ago. It definitely went out.
          We even heeded the change of address
          request.

          JONATHAN
          Well, like I                                                    -- wait, what request?

          TELLER
          Apparently you informed the bank of an
          address change?
          She swivels her monitor so he can see.

          TELLER
          Mr. Jonathan Messer,                                            140                      E.   91st Street -

          We recognize the DOORMAN in the midst of fielding a complaint
          by an ELDERLY TENANT with a yappy dog. Jonathan hurries to
          the elevators, unnoticed.

          INT.                                                            140   E.            91ST -- HALLWAY

          Jonathan emerges from an elevator. The last door on the left.
          Jonathan tries the doorknob. It's locked. Jonathan checks
          under the mat. Sure enough, there's a key.

          INT. THE APARTMENT

          Utterly bare. Empty walls, expensive views, polished wood
          floors. Jonathan takes a wary step inside, leaning to peer
          around the corners.
          He paces cautiously through the living room. The dining area.
          The glistening chrome and granite kitchen.

          THE BEDROOM
          A room as empty as the others - with the exception of a small
          pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner. Jonathan
          slowly nears...to find it's a stack of mail. He picks up an
          envelope -- O.S. the CREAK of a door hinge.
          Jonathan whips around -- no one behind him. He steps out of
          the room to investigate.
          We remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat...
          .until Jonathan finally steps back in, only slightly at
          ease. He returns to the stack of mail, picks up an envelope.
          He reads: "Mr. Jonathan Messer 140 E.                           91    St..."
          Eyes wide, he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail -
          all addressed to him at this address.
          Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief, when he
          finds at the bottom of the stack: another PHOTOGRAPH. It's of
          "S" standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the
          track from Jonathan. And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with
          fear, unaware of a blurred, nearing intruder...

          Long time no see.

          Jonathan spins round, Wyatt's standing there with a gun. It's
          pointing directly at Jonathan.

          WYATT
          I have some instructions. Follow them and
          I might let her live.

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?

          WYATT
          This should've been simpler. I frame you,
          you panic...

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?!
          A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts:

          JONATHAN
          Goddamn it tell me what you did to--

          WYATT
          Press pause on the questions and listen.
          The brokerage firm you're auditing is

          I know you don't. But I do. Your passport.
          (brandishes the gun)
          Now, please.
          Jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him. Wyatt catches it.
          And hands Jonathan an ENVELOPE.

          WYATT
          It's all in there.                                              11                              pm tonight. Their

          JONATHAN
          It won't work - they screen for stuff like
          this. It'll be discovered eventually.

          WYATT
          I can live with eventually. I always have.

          JONATHAN
          This account overseas                                   - it's in my name,
          isn't it?
          A moment of tense silence.
          Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then:

          JONATHAN
          Why'd you pick me?
          Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question.

          WYATT
          You answered the ad, Jonathan.
          (off Jonathan's confusion)
          "Feeling all alone out there? Have a great
          job, fine personality and good looks to
          match, but no time to.meet that special
          someone? Help is just a phone call away -"

          JONATHAN
          The ad - in Money magazine...

          WYATT

          (GRINS)
          Told you to block that Caller ID. Of
          course I had to scope out a whole lot of
          losers before I hit the jackpot. After
          all, there only so many Jonathan Messers
          out there.

          (BEAT)
          If you screw with me, well - you saw what
          I did to that Blonde? That's kindness
          compared to what I'll do to your little
          .girlfriend. You won't even recognize her
          when I'm through.

          JONATHAN
          Why should I believe you? Everything you
          told me was lies.

          WYATT
          Not lies, Jonathan. Foreplay. And now...
          now you're fucked.
          He grins his 'charming' grin and starts for the door.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          Remember: be smart. I'll be watching you.
          And... feel free to take a shower, looks
          like you could do with one.
          The front door slams. Jonathan just stands there, staring
          shell-shocked at the envelope.

          EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

          Jonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his
          suit pocket.
          As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to
          find a car barrelling at us. Jonathan dives out of the way an
          instant before the car would have hit him.
          Face first in the gutter, scraped and gasping, Jonathan peers
          up to see Wyatt's BLACK BMW speeding away.

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - AN OFFICE - LATE DAY

          A stiff guy in his late-30s is working in his office when an
          ASSISTANT enters.

          ASSISTANT
          Mr. Peterson, one of the audit managers is
          here to see you. Jonathan Messer?

          PETERSON

          (PUZZLED)
          Really? Well - okay, bring him back.
          We follow the assistant out the door, read the name
          stencilled on the glass "CHET PETERSON, SENIOR MANAGER."

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - LOBBY

          Through a set of frosted glass doors we see Peterson's
          Assistant approach a RECEPTIONIST, who gestures across the
          lobby. The Assistant approaches the sofas, where Jonathan is
          seated. She addresses him. He rises.

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - PETERSON'S OFFICE

          Chet Peterson looks up as his door is opened -

          PETERSON
          Jonathan, good to see you again!

          YOUNG MAN
          Actually, I was just looking for Fred
          Whipple's office?

          PETERSON

          (AWKWARDLY)
          Next door down.
          The Young Man ducks out, and now Peterson sees his Assistant
          approaching, Jonathan a few paces behind her, adjusting his
          glasses. Peterson reloads his greeting:

          PETERSON
          Jonathan, good to see you again!

          INT. PETERSON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Close on Chet Peterson, gravely peering across his desk.

          PETERSON
          Well, I have to say, your resignation
          comes as something of a surprise. Most of
          our auditors seem to like the freedom the
          position affords.

          (CONCERNED)
          You'll stay on to finish up at Clute
          Nichols, of course?
          Track around Peterson to see Jonathan seated across from him,
          lifting his head to reply - and doing so revealing it's

          "
          Wyatt," wearing one of Jonathan's suits, hair colored and
          styled like Jonathan's, even sporting identical eyeglasses.
          He offers an awkward half-smile, just as Jonathan would.

          WYATT
          Absolutely.

          PETERSON
          So do you have any plans?

          WYATT
          Yes. I'm going to travel. I want to see
          the world.
          Peterson nods benignly.

          Jonathan sitting in the conference room of Clute Nichols,
          lettered-boxed by the glass wall through which he watches
          employees pass in fewer and fewer numbers. Throughout this,
          Jonathan's blank stare of harrowed tension never changes.

          Abeautiful shot of the cityscape - accompanied by the sound

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS - CONFERENCE ROOM

          Jonathan seated at the far end of the empty table, typing on
          his laptop. Beside him is the envelope Wyatt gave him, and
          its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed.
          Jonathan peers at the laptop clock. It reads                            10:58   PM.
          His eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions, to
          laptop screen, to glass wall - fingers typing all the while.
          He finally reaches a prompt: BIENVENUE. POUR ANGLAIS, CBOISEZ P2.
          We glimpse a small. logo with a SWISS FLAG.
          Jonathan presses F2. Reads some more, types some more.
          Finally we read: ENTER SUB-ACCOUNT NUMBER.
          Jonathan enters more per Wyatt's typed instructions. Reads.

          ENTER DESIGNATED ACCOUNT NUMBER:
          Jonathan copies the numbers in from the instructions. Waits.

          ENTER SENDER'S 8 DIGIT ACCESS CODE. REQUIRED TO COMPLETE TRANSACTION.
          His eyes travel to a page atop a Clute Nichols file. We can
          glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil. Jonathan stares at
          the cursor.on the laptop screen, the icon blinking
          petulantly. He's about to type...
          And then he halts. His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE,
          resting in its charger.
          TIGHTER ON JONATHAN. His eyes fixed on the cell phone, an
          idea forming in his mind --
          RING!! of the cell phone suddenly jars us. RING... Jonathan
          hesitates, then picks up.

          Jonathan says nothing. We can hear Wyatt getting tenser:

          WYATT (O.S.)
          I said what's taking you?

          JONATHAN
          I wondered if you were monitoring this.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Don't worry about what I'm doing. Just
          finish the transaction. Now.

          JONATHAN
          Not until I see her.
          (off Wyatt's silence)
          The transfer's impossible without an
          access code. And there's no way I'm
          entering it until I'm sure that she's
          safe. So you tell me. How do we do that?
          Wyatt still remains unnervingly silent. We tighten on
          Jonathan, holding his breath, any plan he's concocting
          clearly hinging on this...

          WYATT (0..S.)
          (low, frustrated)
          You have a wireless connection?
          Jonathan lets out a brief exhalation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan snaps his laptop lid shut, packs it in his gym bag,
          in which we glimpse the photo he's kept with him of "S"
          smiling up at him.
          He then turns to his cell phone once more. He picks it up,
          scrolls the menu, punches a number.

          EXT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - ROOFTOP - LATE NIGHT

          An elaborate and intensely packed WEDDING PARTY is being held
          up here beneath the glow of heat lamps, the music and crowd
          noise unspeakably loud. We travel through the din, past
          hundreds of well-heeled partiers, mainly young and wealthy.

          EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

          The party noise is even slightly audible                        30   stories below,
          where we find Jonathan carrying his bag as he enters...

          INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY

          Jonathan surveys the busy lobby. GUESTS mulling. STAFF
          bustling. And, of course, the "ELOISE" PORTRAIT.

          WYATT (O.S.)'
          May I ask you a personal question?
          Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic
          smile. With Wyatt's new look, they could be brothers.
          Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and
          tense. Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan's hand.

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?

          WYATT
          In one of the rooms. Safe.
          (a thin smile)
          I got us a table.

          A WAITRESS delivers a pair of drinks to where Jonathan and
          Wyatt are seated.

          WAITRESS
          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy.
          The Waitress leaves. Wyatt raises his glass.

          WYATT
          To friendship.
          Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt.

          WYATT
          He was dead when I met him. Just like you.
          The rest was a mere formality.
          (re: the laptop)
          Of course he didn't have your bargaining
          chip. Speaking of which...

          JONATHAN
          Not until I see her. She's the only reason
          I'm here and not at the police.

          WYATT
          I told you, she's in a room. Alive.

          JONATHAN
          Give me the key then.
          Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card
          and slides it across the table. Of course there's nothing on
          the key card to indicate a room number.

          WYATT
          As soon as you're done, I'll tell you the
          room number.

          JONATHAN
          Not good enough.
          Wyatt reaches for the key card; as he does we glimpse a
          handgun concealed by his suit.

          JONATHAN
          You won't let her live. You killed all the
          others, you'll have to kill us too.

          WYATT
          Hey, I like you, okay? You'll be fine.

          JONATHAN
          (scoffs, repulsed)
          You like me.

          WYATT
          I do, Jonathan. In my way. After all,
          you're my creation. I'm the one who gave
          you life.

          JONATHAN
          Don't you get it? It was her, not you!
          She's the one. She gave me life! You can
          steal my identity, but not what's here.

          He puts his hand on his heart. Wyatt is startled by
          Jonathan's passionate outburst.

          WYATT
          Yeah, well, I'm weeping big wet ones for
          you both. Now, let's get on with it.

          (BEAT)
          I don't have all night, Jonathan.
          Jonathan reluctantly nods his assent. Wyatt lets go of the
          key card. Jonathan opens his bag...

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as it defuzzes from sleep.
          The screen as it was, cursor blinking by the request for an
          access code.
          Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan starts to type -- then
          pauses, looking confused.
          Jonathan quickly reaches around. to the back of his laptop,
          feels an empty jack - and suddenly turns pale.

          WYATT
          What is it?

          JONATHAN
          My wireless modem - I must have left it in
          the conference room. I can't get back
          online.
          Wyatt glares at Jonathan, seething.

          I can go back there and-

          Empty at this hour, with the exception of a sleepy-looking

          the hotel key card, his eyes travelling up to a clock
          overhead:                                                       11:29.

          Satisfied, Wyatt finds a comfortable chair with a direct view

          Across the lobby, an attractive AUBURN-HAIRED WOMAN in
          business attire glances over at him.

          Jonathan is subtly slipping the                                 $100                            bill to the Employee.

          EMPLOYEE
          You forgot your. own room number?

          JONATHAN
          I just checked in and it's been a hectic
          day. Look at me!
          The Employee looks uneasy - something about the ill-concealed
          tension in Jonathan's eyes.

          EMPLOYEE
          You could just ask at the front desk. I'm
          sure they can-

          JONATHAN
          I really don't have time, okay?
          Jonathan presses the bill into the Employee's palm, peers up
          at the clock again: the big hand clicks over to 11:30.

          Wyatt looks relieved -- when his view is abruptly blocked by
          the Auburn-Haired Woman.

          AUBURN HAIR
          Pardon me, but may I ask you something -
          personal?
          Wyatt quickly looks up at her, momentarily confused.

          AUBURN HAIR
          Are you waiting for me?

          BACK TO JONATHAN IN BUSINESS CENTER
          The Employee finishes swiping his card through a scanner.

          His view of Jonathan still obscured by Auburn Hair.

          What the hell are you --
          And then he sees Auburn Hair glance unsurely at the Eloise
          portrait, then at her cell phone's clock -- and now realizes:

          WYATT
          Motherfucker!
          He jumps up, shoves Auburn Hair aside - eyes darting to the
          Business Center to find Jonathan no longer behind the glass,
          just his laptop resting on the counter where he'd been
          standing.

          INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR

          Jonathan rushes into an elevator car just as it's about to
          close. He turns to find a YOUNG FAMILY riding up with him.
          They've pressed floor 6. He presses floor                       9.

          

          

          

          

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY

          Wyatt arrives at the elevators - none are ready to open. He
          furiously presses the call button, his hand hovering by his
          concealed gun.

          INT.                                                            6TH FLOOR HALLWAY - ELEVATORS

          Ding as the elevator doors open and the family step out.
          Jonathan is left alone, impatiently waiting for the doors to
          close -
          - when his eyes land on something in the hallway: the fire
          alarm. He suddenly reaches out to stop the elevator door just
          as it's about to close.

          INT.                                                            6TH FLOOR HALLWAY

          alarm blares to life. Pan                                                                                                                                     180   to find Jonathan dipping into
          an emergency exit stairwell.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY

          Wyatt is just about to step onto an elevator, when a crowd of
          wedding guests also start to pile in. Furious, he abandons
          the elevators for the nearest stairs.

          INT.                                                            7TH FLOOR HALLWAY

          GUESTS spilling out of rooms met by the blaring alarm...

          . as Jonathan smashes the glass of yet another fire alarm.

          Surveillance monitors show guests in the various hallways and
          stairwells rushing in confusion at all angles...

          EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP

          Only the party 30 stories above remains oblivious: music
          still blasting, the upscale throngs still partying.

          INT. STAIRWELL

          Wyatt is bounding up the stairs, rounding the Fifth Floor -
          - when he hears the door overhead bang open, and like a tidal
          wave a flood of guests fill the stairwell.
          Wyatt presses against the crush of bodies, pushing his way up
          the stairwell.

          INT.                                                            9TH FLOOR - HALLWAY

          banged open by Jonathan's shoulder.
          The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan
          races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past
          in sporadic fits                                                -                                      925...921...           918...   913...   910...
          Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907.
          He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot --
          when a hand grabs his forearm! He spins in panic to --
          - a CLEANING WOMAN. She says something.in Vietnamese,
          indicating the ringing alarms.

          JONATHAN
          Fire, I know - I'll be out in a minute.
          The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan
          quickly slides the key in the slot. The light blinks green.
          He jerks the door handle and throws open the door to find -

          INT. ROOM 907

          - nothing. The room is freshly made up, no sign of life other
          than A PORNO FILM BLARING from the TV set on Pay-Per-View.
          Jonathan's heart is pounding - where is she? He searches
          every corner, the bathroom, the closets. Everywhere.
          The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the
          neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the
          incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set --
          Jonathan suddenly erupts, grips the TV and shoves it off its
          ledge. It hits the floor with a crash, and sudden silence.
          Jonathan rubs his brow, heaving in desperation -- when his
          eyes land on the sleek, dark piece on which the TV was

          CONTINUED:
          resting; it's a dense, rectangular block - only when Jonathan
          taps it, he realizes: it's hollow.
          He immediately seizes it, yanks it from the wall...
          And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: "S".
          Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over. She looks
          semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped. Jonathan
          hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by
          how lifeless she appears -
          - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say
          anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her
          face to his chest.

          âS.,
          (whispers gratefully)
          You're alive.
          He's struck by these words, and nods, holding her face in his
          hands as he kisses her urgently and gratefully.

          JONATHAN
          What do you say we stick together from now
          on?

          JA S"
          I'd like that.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL

          A rush of guests hurriedly descending the staircase, a
          seemingly endless stream of densely packed faces.
          Close on Wyatt jostled within the flow of the wealthy guests -
          as he's the only one heading up. He passes the 6th floor...

          INT.                                                             9TH FLOOR

          Jonathan and "S" hurrying down the hall - Jonathan torn
          between a choice of two stairwells. His eyes dart from one to
          another                                                          - he finally gambles on the one to the right.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL

          Wyatt forcing his way upstream with menacing determination;
          his gaze is wilder, more and more irritated by the descending
          mob of successful, well-dressed guests he's pushing against --
          - when he halts, peering up through the railings' lozenge-
          shaped opening, past a collection of hands and profiles...
          .to Jonathan and "S" some three stories above.

          CONTINUED:
          TIGHT ON WYATT. As yet unnoticed by Jonathan, he remains
          halted on a stair, bodies squeezing past him.
          TIGHTER ON HIS EYES. That predatory gleam.
          EVEN TIGHTER ON HIS GUN, tucked carefully at his side.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" three stories above, starting to
          descend -- when Jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the
          flow of bodies below.
          Immediately wary, he leans over the railing, but can't get a
          good look. He grips the railing, leans further over... and
          his eyes find Wyatt's staring right back up at him --

          JONATHAN
          He's down there! I saw him -

          11 SIP
          Oh God -

          JONATHAN
          Up - we've got to go up!
          Clutching her arm, Jonathan and "S" turn back up, against the
          flow of traffic. Stories above, less and less people are
          evacuating.
          ANGLE ON WYATT as he presses upward, his steely gaze even
          more rapacious.
          The crowd is thinning as Jonathan and "S" race upward as
          well.
          INSERT JONATHAN'S POV: a shaky, dizzying blur as they race
          higher and higher...
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: from below but gaining on them, Jonathan
          and "S". appearing and disappearing with each twist and turn
          of the staircase...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S", desperately racing upwards...
          CLOSE ON WYATT bounding the stairs, footsteps echoing, the
          staircase now empty and quiet, save for the footfall of
          Jonathan and "S"                                                 - no more than three floors above Wyatt
          now...
          Wyatt slows his pace, leans into the railing, takes aim...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" still hurrying up - when a shot
          rings out, a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell, the

          with him                                                         -
          - when a second shot rings out, the bullet punching a dent
          into the underside of the stairs just overhead.
          ON WYATT, realizing he needs a cleaner shot, taking the
          stairs even harder in pursuit, all merciless intensity.

          EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

          The party is still at full throttle. Apparently no one has
          yet told them of the alarms.
          CLOSE ON A STAIRWELL DOOR MARKED "EMERGENCY EXIT" as it
          suddenly bangs open and Jonathan and "S" spill out.
          They pause a moment - thrown by the sight of all the wealthy,
          beautiful faces, laughing, dancing.

          JONATHAN
          Come on!
          She grabs his hand, and they waste no time disappearing into
          the mass of bodies.
          They keep moving. Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of
          partiers, they fit right in - instantly anonymous                - though
          not as smartly attired.
          BACK TO THE STAIRWELL DOOR as Wyatt enters the party,
          scanning the dense crowd, all senses alert.
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: just a mass of successful, attractive,
          partying young men and women. There's no way to pick Jonathan
          and "S" out.
          Wyatt's smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks the
          periphery.
          WITHIN THE CROWD "S" clutches Jonathan's hand, their heads
          ducked low as they press forward...
          CLOSE ON WYATT, frustration gnashing at him as he quickens
          his pace, the idiotic enthusiasm of the crowd enraging him,
          sweat beading on his face                                        --
          -- when suddenly the music stops. Wyatt frowns., eyes darting.

          The crowd noise resumes, as the throngs begrudgingly start
          for the exits.
          ON JONATHAN AND "S," doing their best to stay concealed
          within the exiting crowd.
          Angle on Wyatt pushing his way through the crush, shoving
          people aside, trying to find them -
          - when he suddenly stops. He has an idea. He takes out his
          cell phone.
          BACK TO JONATHAN AND "5" within the crowd -
          - when Jonathan's cell phone RINGS.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN as his eyes widen in panic.
          RING... He quickly fumbles for it, tries to turn it off        -
          - but it's too late... WHIP ACROSS THE CROWD to Wyatt,
          grinning wider. He's spotted them. In an instant he is bee-
          lining through the packed suits.
          WIDE SHOT OF THE ROOFTOP as the throngs are clearing out.
          Jonathan grabs "S" as they duck, racing across the dark,
          rooftop, looking for a place to hide.
          They take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge -
          gasping to catch their breath... Stepping back, "S's" foot
          clinks against something: a stray iron railing post.
          She reaches. down for it, starts to lift it -
          - when Wyatt's hand darts in and grasps the other end.
          She looks up in terror - when Wyatt punches her violently,
          knocking her to the ground.
          Jonathan rushes to her - only to be blocked by Wyatt,
          gripping the iron rod tight.

          WYATT
          Nice try back there, Jonathan. Looks like
          you picked up a thing or two from me.
          Jonathan tries to strike him - when with a lightning quick
          movement Wyatt whips the iron rod through the air, cracking
          Jonathan across the face.

          racquet, steps into position                                   -
          - and brings the rod down on Jonathan with ruthless tennis
          strokes: Backhand! Bam! Forehand! Bam! Slice! Bam!
          Jonathan can barely peer up, bloody and beaten. He hears
          Wyatt drop the iron rod...

          swoops in on us

          yanks him back to the roof's concrete ledge. Jonathan fights
          to struggle free - when Wyatt jams the gun under his chin.
          Jonathan freezes.

          They'll... catch... you...

          Me? No - no, I'm just a face in the crowd.
          I'm a tourist, just passing through.
          JONATHAN'S POV: Wyatt's face presses closer, now almost in
          focus as he presses Jonathan's torso back over the ledge -

          WYATT
          As for you, you had your fun...
          Wyatt presses closer, crushing Jonathan's back to the edge.

          Now we're going to go back down...

          fingers fumbling for the cell phone                            (Jonathan's old phone).

          WYATT
          We're going to get that laptop...

          - to find she's right beside him, grateful tears in her eye.

          against the other.
          The 'shock of it all is beginning to fade. He reaches into his

          What's your name?
          "S" considers the request, then smiles gently, leans in close
          and whispers the answer in his ear. Jonathan gazes at her a
          moment - whatever her name is, it must be perfect.

          JONATHAN
          So what now?
          She smiles up at him.

          S
          Well... are you free tonight?
          On Jonathan: treasuring these moments. He is truly free --
          perhaps for the first time in his life.

          JONATHAN
          Yes. I'm free.
          They gaze at each other.
          We leave Jonathan and "S" to their privacy, pulling back as
          they continue talking, continuing away until we're

          THROUGH A WINDOW AND INSIDE THE HOTEL ITSELF
          the window itself now a frame, letter-boxing the scene,
          people passing like fish in their tank... except for Jonathan
          and S, seated center-frame, two small figures side by side,
          face to face, talking intimately as we.

          FADE OUT.

1   INT. CHAMPION AIRCRAFT - BENNY GIACOMO'S OFFICE                1

    A battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown
    skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a
    pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup.

                             O.S. VOICE
                You know, when you fire somebody
                you have to stick to your guns.

    They screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer.

                             O.S. VOICE
                      (continuing)
                The men might get to thinkin' that
                I'm weak if I take you back.

    The cup rises to the face of BENNY GIACOMO, late forties,
    with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black. Skin
    darker than a Louisiana Creole.

    He takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the
    whiskey. As he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet
    kicked up on the desk, fully in charge.

    A Betty Grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in
    more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a
    calendar tacked to the wall: May, 1948.

                             BENNY
                      (continuing)
                And I didn't tell Dupree that I'd
                give you your job back... All I
                said was that I'd be glad to talk
                to you if you said the right
                thing... Do you have something to
                say?

    A stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a
    man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously.

                             MAN
                Mr. Giacomo, when one of the white
                guys has come off a double shift
                and says he's too tired to work
                overtime, you don't fire him.

                             BENNY
                Fella, what'd I tell ya? If you're
                not willing to give a little extra,
                Champion can't use you.

    EASY RAWLINS, thirty, handsome and a much darker brown than
    Giacomo, takes a drag off a Chesterfield cigarette.

                                                                2.

    Through the window behind him, a team of men pour over a
    partly assembled airplane, their voices echoing in the
    hangar that surrounds the office.

    Benny measures out his words one at a time.

                              BENNY (O.S.)
                 Now... Do... you... have...
                 something... to say?

    Easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about
    swallowing his pride as well. And then:

                              EASY
                 I want my job back, Mr. Giacomo. I
                 need to work and I need a good job.

                                BENNY (O.S.)
                 Is that all?

    Easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep
    from bowing his head.

                              EASY
                 No, that's not all... I need money
                 so that I can pay my mortgage and
                 eat... I need a house to live in
                 and a place to raise children... I
                 need to buy clothes so I can--

                              BENNY
                 I'm sorry, fella, but I gotta get
                 back to work...

    And he swings his feet down and stands up to go.   But Easy
    is up too, blocking his way out the door.

                              EASY
                 Ezekiel, Mr. Giacomo.

                                BENNY
                 Hunh?

                              EASY
                 My name is Ezekiel... Ezekiel
                 Rawlins.

    Benny clinches his fists and focuses on Easy's chest like a
    fighter. And Easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a
    field goal with his right knee.

    Slowly, Giacomo's face creases into a plastic grin and he
    shrugs.

                                                                3.

                              BENNY
                 S'cuse me, Ezekiel.

    And he walks around Easy, shaking his head as if amused.

    Easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from
    Duke Ellington's "Absinthe" snakes up like sin and we

2   FADE TO BLACK                                                    2

    And watch the titles, the last one reading "Two Weeks
    Later"...

    FADE IN:

    Black and grey cars, Packards and Buicks from 1928 to 1948,
    come and go on Central Avenue. Two-storied storefronts with
    canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats... all in
    a hurry.

    The Red Car rumbles through and then a white Cadillac
    convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop.

    Above the shop on the next floor are large partly open
    windows with JOPPY'S BAR in boldface letters. Inside sits
    Easy, back to the window reading the classified ads.

4   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                                 4

    T-Bone Walker's "Westside Baby" plays on the jukebox as Easy
    takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out.

    THE FRONT PAGE of the LOS ANGELES TIMES lies face up on the
    table beneath the ashtray displaying A PHOTOGRAPH of a
    middle-aged white man and his pretty young woman companion
    smiling and waving.

    Above the happy couple is a headline "CARTER DROPS OUT OF
    RACE"... The caption under the photo reads "Wealthy civic
    leader, Todd Carter, shown here with his lovely bride-to-be,
    Daphne Monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for
    comment on his surprising withdrawal from the Mayor's race."

                              O.S. VOICE
                 Catch ya later, Joppy.

    BACK TO SCENE

    SPLACK! An older black man hitching up his pants underneath
    a bloodstained butcher's apron has slapped his empty beer
    glass down hard on the counter on his way out.

                                                               4.

4   CONTINUED:                                                      4

                              JOPPY
                 Hey, watch the marble!   Dammit,
                 what'd I tell you?

    The fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big
    stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top
    of the bar with a filthy rag. Behind him is a yellow
    billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading "Fuller
    vs. Shag. 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT." We could make out more of
    the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around
    it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.

                              EASY
                 Joppy, how much they payin' out
                 there at McDonell Douglas?

                               JOPPY
                 I don't know.   Don't it say--

    His words hang as his eyes stray toward the door.

    Easy looks up also at

    THE DOORWAY which fills with the large frame of the white
    MAN in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the
    room. Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the
    tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at Joppy and walks to
    the far end of the bar.

    Easy is surprised to see Joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he
    is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like
    he's answering a summons. The white man extends a friendly
    hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in
    close to talk in private.

    Easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he
    takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks.
    After a moment...

                              JOPPY
                 Easy, come on over here. This
                 here's somebody I want ya to
                 meet... Come on. This here's a
                 friend of mine.

    Easy drains his glass and stands up, then walks over.

                               JOPPY
                 Yeah, Easy.   This here's Mr.
                 Albright.

                              ALBRIGHT
                 You can call me Dewitt, Easy.

                                                             5.

    He extends his hand and Easy shakes it.

                              EASY
                 How ya doin'?

                              JOPPY
                       (bowing and grinning)
                 Mr. Albright and me goes back to
                 before the war when I was still in
                 the fight game.

                              ALBRIGHT
                       (to Easy)
                 Ever seen this guy fight...? Any
                 time Joppy Shag stepped in the ring
                 you knew you were gonna see some
                 real knock-down-drag-out-
                 fisticuffs... Where you from, Easy?

                              EASY
                       (awkwardly)
                 Houston.

                              ALBRIGHT
                 Houston... Joppy's hometown.

    Joppy pours Albright a straight shot of Wild Turkey and the
    big man sips it.

                              ALBRIGHT
                 So I hear you need a job.

    Easy throws a look at Joppy, but Joppy is busy buffing the
    bar and putting more of Easy's business in the street.

                              JOPPY
                 Aw yeah, Easy always tryin' to do
                 better. Got his high school
                 certificate from night school.
                 He's threatenin' up on some
                 college. And he's one of the few
                 colored men around here who owns
                 his own house. Shoot, he pays a
                 mortgage every month just like a
                 white man.

                              ALBRIGHT
                 Property owner, hunh?

    He turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the
    counter.

                                                             6.

                              ALBRIGHT
                       (continuing)
                 These big companies, don't give a
                 damn, do they?

    He reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card
    and scribbles something on it.

                              ALBRIGHT
                       (continuing)
                 If you need a job, drop by this
                 address at seven tonight.

    Easy takes the card and glances at it.

                              EASY
                 What kind of work you do?

                              ALBRIGHT
                 I do favors... I do favors for
                 friends. Drop by.

    He nods to Joppy and walks out the door.

                              EASY
                 Who the hell is that, Joppy?

                              JOPPY
                 Just somebody I know... A bidness
                 man.

                              EASY
                 What kinda business?

                              JOPPY
                 Oh, I don't ask him all that. He
                 comes in here every so often
                 looking for somebody to do a little
                 job for him... He pays good.

                              EASY
                 In other words, he's a gangster.

                              JOPPY
                 I didn't say that... But if there's
                 a dollar laying in the street I
                 don't think he'll let a little dirt
                 stop him from picking it up. If
                 you worried about making that house
                 note this month, maybe you wanna
                 pay him a call. All them pretty
                 girls you be with ain't gonna buy
                 you a house.

                                                                7.

    Easy cocks his head "Are you crazy?"

                              JOPPY
                       (continuing)
                 Sound like he just wants you to
                 keep your eyes open for somebody...
                 He'll pay you whether you see
                 anything or not... If it was me I'd
                 take that man's money and go on
                 about my bidness... Ain't nothin'
                 to worry about.

    Easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the
    card.

                              EASY (V.O.)
                 When somebody tells me "Don't
                 worry," I usually look down to see
                 if my fly is open... I noticed
                 Albright didn't bother to pay for
                 his drink.

5   EXT. EASY'S '46 PONTIAC - DAY                                    5

    Little single family houses with tiny yards of St. Augustine
    grass rush toward the amber Indianhead hood ornament on
    Easy's car.

    Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo" plays on the radio as Easy
    heads for home in thought.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                       (continuing)
                 DeWitt Albright reminded me of
                 somebody I knew back in Houston.
                 His name was Raymond Alexander but
                 we called him Mouse... Mouse called
                 hisself a businessman too. And I
                 found out that I shouldn't be
                 nowhere around when Mouse got down
                 to his business... I learned that
                 the hard way.

    A neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at Easy as
    he slows down in front of his house.

7   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                          7

    He gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man
    giving goat cart rides, washes past him in the street.

                                                                8.

     A MAN with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a
     wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind Easy as
     he opens his gate.

                               WOODCUTTER
                  Want me to knock down some of them
                  trees back there for you?

                               EASY
                        (irritated)
                  No... Just leave the trees alone.

     Easy continues up his walkway past flower beds of dahlias
     and wild roses and stops on his front porch to check on his
     African violets in a jar next to the front door.

8    INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                                8

     He walks into his tiny living room and tosses his jacket
     onto the sofa. Then moves on through the kitchen and out
     the back door.

9    EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY                              9

     He picks up a water hose and turns on the faucet, watering
     and admiring his apple, avocado, pomegranate and banana
     trees as he lights a cigarette.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  I had moved to Los Angeles right
                  after the war with three hundred
                  dollars and the G.I. Bill... And I
                  liked coming home to a place that
                  was mine... According to President
                  Truman I had that comin' to me
                  'cause I had fought in 'the good
                  war' against Hitler in Europe...
                  But that didn't mean a damn thing
                  to a lotta white folks including
                  the foreman on my job... So, here I
                  was out of work needin' thirty-two
                  dollars to pay the mortgage... That
                  was three days pay on my old job --
                  and I had about three days to get
                  it.

10   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT                                    10

     Easy parks in front of a large Spanish-style building.   He
     gets out and walks to the black wrought iron entrance.

                                                                 9.

11    EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                           11

      Easy makes his way through the overgrown patio with roses
      and vines cascading down from office windows on the second
      floor.

A12   INT. OFFICE - NIGHT                                             A12

      Someone is watching Easy as he looks for the right office.

12    EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                           12

      A small white MAN pops out from behind a hedge startling
      Easy. He wears a suit that also serves as a uniform.

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  What are you doing here?

                               EASY
                  I'm looking for, uh...

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  We only take deliveries between
                  nine and six...

                               EASY
                  No, no... I...

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Yes, we do!   Now you'd better
                  leave.

      He clutches a baton in his hand and swats it into his open
      palm.

                               EASY
                  Uh... Albright!

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  What?

                               EASY
                  I'm here to see Mr. Albright.
                  DeWitt Albright!

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  Where's your delivery?

      He holds out his scrawny hand.

                               EASY
                  I have an appointment -- I'm
                  supposed to meet him.

                                                              10.

12   CONTINUED:                                                     12

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  Did he give you a note to come in
                  here after hours?

     Easy only stares, hating this little man.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Well, did he?   Because if he
                  didn't--

                               EASY
                  Forget it, man. Next time I see
                  him I'll just tell him you wouldn't
                  let me in.

     Disgusted, Easy turns to leave.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Hold on.

     He sizes up Easy and then points across the courtyard.

                               SECURITY GUARD
                        (like an order)
                  Across that way to the left and
                  down the stairs...

     Easy half nods/half glares and walks away.

13   OMIT                                                           13

     At the other side of the garden Easy turns a corner and
     heads down concrete steps. At the bottom he opens a door
     leading into

14   INT. BASEMENT - CORRIDOR                                       14

     He looks into the boiler room but turns into an empty
     corridor stopping at a heavy steel door at the end.

     He knocks. After a moment a tall and slight MAN with curly
     brown hair and the complexion of an East Indian opens the door.

15   INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM                                          15

     A short and stocky kind of Chinese-looking MAN stands
     against the door at the far end. The Tall Man ushers Easy
     into the clutter of heavy metal tools, cans of paint and
     cleaning solutions. A card table with two chairs sits idly.
     The Tall Man closes the door and holds out his hand. Easy
     reaches to shake it but the man starts to pat Easy on his
     side and Easy pushes him away.

                                                             11.

15   CONTINUED:                                                     15

                                 EASY
                  Hey, man!    What's wrong with you?

     The Chinese Man slips a hand inside his coat and the Tall
     Man smiles.

                               TALL MAN
                        (with an accent)
                  Mr. Rawlins, put your hands up a
                  little from your sides, please.

                               EASY
                  Keep your hands to yourself. I
                  don't let no man feel on me like
                  that.

     The Chinese Man pulls some kind of weapon halfway out and
     takes a step forward, and the Tall Man tries to put his hand
     against Easy's chest but Easy grabs his wrist.

                                TALL MAN
                  Don't worry, Manny. He's okay.
                  Just a little shaky.
                        (indicating the door)
                  Let him know.

     Manny pushes his weapon back in his coat and knocks on the
     door behind him.

     After a moment, DeWitt Albright opens up.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                          (smiling)
                  Easy.

                               TALL MAN
                  He doesn't want us to touch him.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Leave it, Shariff. I just wanted
                  to make sure he was solo.

                               SHARIFF
                  You're the boss.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  You guys can go now. Easy and I
                  have some business.

16   INT. MAINTENANCE OFFICE                                        16

     Easy follows Albright inside and the big man goes behind a
     big wooden desk and puts his bone-colored shoes up next to a
     half full bottle of Wild Turkey. On the other end of the
     desk a small radio scratches out the Glen Gray Orchestra's
     "Gotta Be This or That."

                                                             12.

16   CONTINUED:                                                     16

     There is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him
     with a picture of a basket of blackberries, but other than
     that the room is bare.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Have a seat, Mr. Rawlins.

     Easy takes a seat in a chair in front of the desk and tries
     not to stare at the tan leather shoulder holster under
     Albright's arm with the muzzle of the pistol almost reaching
     his belt.

                               EASY
                        (gesturing back)
                  Your friends, hunh?

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Like you, Easy. I need a little
                  help? I give 'em a call... Drink?

                               EASY
                  Sure.

     Albright pulls another glass from the desk drawer and pours
     a fresh one for Easy and fresher one for himself.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  One thing I like about working for
                  myself... I always have a bottle on
                  the table... You wanna drink with
                  me? Fine. You don't? Door's
                  right behind you... Joppy tells me
                  you're a war hero... Said you went
                  in with Patton.

     Easy nods, proud but polite, and Albright pushes him a glass
     of whiskey.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  So, you want the job?

                               EASY
                  Depends on what kind of job. I
                  don't want to get mixed up in
                  nothing.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Walk out the door in the morning,
                  Easy, and you're mixed up in
                  something. Only thing that matters
                  is if you're mixed up to the top or
                  not.

                                                             13.

16   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               16

                               EASY
                  I mean I don't wanna get mixed up
                  with the law...

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Neither one of us wants to get
                  mixed up in that. That's just rich
                  people trying to keep me and you in
                  our place.

     He laughs and takes a healthy swig and Easy takes a drink
     too.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I'm looking for somebody for a
                  friend.

     He pushes a newspaper across the desk to Easy and Easy holds
     it up.

     NEWSPAPER

     It's the front page with the photograph of the wealthy Todd
     Carter and his beautiful bride-to-be... Despite her smile,
     there's a sadness in the eyes.

                               ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                  Daphne Monet... fiancée of Todd
                  Carter, one of the richest men in
                  town... Been gone for two weeks...

     BACK TO SCENE

                               EASY
                  She leave him?

                                ALBRIGHT
                  Evidently... You know how it is
                  with women, Easy... Happens to the
                  best of us...

     He rears back in his chair as if expecting a sign of
     recognition.

                               EASY
                  I ain't never heard of her before.
                  I wouldn't know how to find a woman
                  like that.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  That's a shame.

     He laughs a conspiratorial, lecher's laugh and Easy allows a
     smile.

                                                               14.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  See, Daphne has a predilection for
                  the company of Negroes. She likes
                  jazz and pigs feet and dark meat,
                  know what I mean.

     The insult takes Easy off guard but he should've known.

                               EASY
                  So you think she might be down in
                  Watts.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I'm sure of it. But I can't go
                  looking for her myself because I'm
                  not of the right persuasion, so to
                  speak. I've been asking Joppy for
                  over a week, but all he could do
                  was introduce me to you.

                               EASY
                  What do you want me to do?

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Just get a location on her. Mr.
                  Carter wants to make up with her...

                                EASY
                  That's all.

                               ALBRIGHT
                        (smiling)
                  That's all.

     He pulls out a brown secretary-type wallet and counts out 10
     ten-dollar bills into a neat stack next to the whiskey.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  One hundred dollars, and I pay in
                  advance.

     Easy eyes the money.   All he has to do is pick it up.

                               EASY
                  I just have to tell you where she
                  is?

                               ALBRIGHT
                  That's right. And keep it, you
                  know, confidential...

     He freshens Easy's drink and Easy eyes the money some more.

                                                             15.

                  Joppy tells me you used to frequent
                  an illegal club down on Eighty-
                  ninth and Central. Somebody saw
                  Daphne there a few nights ago. You
                  could start tonight.

     Easy takes a drink and looks again at the money.

17   EXT. JOHN'S PLACE (MARKET) - NIGHT                             17

     Stripped down to its dark, naked self, Central Avenue has
     drawn a crowd from all over town. Neon glistens off slick
     pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh.

     An outrage to police even before the era of Police Chief
     Parker's personal crusade, a squad car sits idling while two
     dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey sharkskin zoot
     suit, prodding and whapping with nightsticks, searching for
     something -- anything -- because his date is a young white
     woman. A few onlookers stand back watching, but since this
     white woman is not Daphne Monet, Easy only glances and walks
     inside.

18   INT. JOHN'S BAR                                                18

     Easy sees his fifth white MAN that day in a disheveled but
     expensive dark blue suit staggering toward him, reeking of
     gin.

                               DRUNK
                  Hey, colored brother. I need you
                  to do somethin' for me--

                               O.S. WOMAN'S VOICE
                  Go on. What'd I tell you about
                  hair-assing my customers.

     Easy looks over to see HATTIE PARSONS, the small, brown-
     skinned manager of the place, glaring daggers at the drunk
     man while watching the commotion out the window.

     Easy starts over toward Hattie and the drunk turns and tries
     to grab Easy's arm. But his desperation causes him to trip
     and he winds up sitting against the wall.

     Easy steps over him and joins Hattie at the window.

                               HATTIE
                  I just paid these damn cops and
                  they still roustin' my customers.
                  Well, that's what he gets for being
                  with that white woman.

                                                             16.

18   CONTINUED:                                                     18

     She walks over to the cash register of this neighborhood
     corner store; and Easy follows, the drunk beckoning him to
     bend down to talk as he passes.

                               DRUNK
                  Come on, brother help me...

                               HATTIE
                  Don't worry 'bout him. I rung
                  Junior ten minutes ago to come get
                  him.

     Easy pulls out two dollars and Hattie deposits them into the
     till.

                               HATTIE
                  I ain't got nobody tonight but Lips
                  and his trio -- Holiday came
                  through here last Tuesday.

                                 EASY
                  Yeah?

                                 HATTIE
                  Yeah.

     Heavy FOOTSTEPS are heard pounding down a stairway in the
     back of the store and big burly JUNIOR FORNAY lumbers in
     with a cigarette hanging from his lips.

                               JUNIOR
                  Where's he at?

     Hattie points to the drunk man as he struggles to get to his
     feet.

                               HATTIE
                  Over there. Let Easy in upstairs
                  and when these cops leave throw his
                  ass out.

                                 EASY
                  Hey, Junior.    What's goin' on?

                                 JUNIOR
                  Not too much.    But stick around.

     Junior leads the way back up the stairs.

19   OMIT                                                           19

A20   INT. JOHN'S SPEAKEASY STAIRWELL                                  A20

                               EASY
                  You got a cigarette?

                                 JUNIOR
                  Sure.

      He pulls out his pack and stops to light Easy up.   Easy
      starts coughing as they continue up the stairs.

                              EASY
                  Damn! How do you smoke these
                  things?

                               JUNIOR
                  Don't you hafta work tomorrow?

                                 EASY
                  Naw.    I got fired.

      A hint of a smile appears on Junior's face.

                               JUNIOR
                  The last time I heard these fellas
                  playin' tonight was back in
                  Houston, the night your ole buddy
                  Mouse had to pull me up off your
                  ass.

      Easy grins and shakes his head.

                               EASY
                  That's the way you remember it,
                  hunh?

                               JUNIOR
                  Hell, that's the way it was.

      And he stops to unlock the door.

                               JUNIOR
                        (continuing)
                  When you gonna admit that you
                  helped Mouse kill old man
                  Navrochet?

                               EASY
                  Aw, man, get off that. I ain't had
                  nothin' to do with that.

      Junior opens the door and Lips' alto horn slaps Easy in the
      face. Half of Houston, Texas seems to be jammed into this
      place.

                                                              18.

                                EASY
                   Boy, it's happenin' tonight.
                   Where's all the white women at?

                                JUNIOR
                   I don't pay them white girls no
                   mind.

                                EASY
                         (sarcastically)
                   Yeah... I bet you don't.

      And he steps in.

                                JUNIOR
                   That's right. Just like you didn't
                   help mouse kill his stepfather.

                                 EASY
                   Go on, man.

      And he starts away inside.

                                JUNIOR
                   Hey, Easy. Did you help him kill
                   his stepbrother, too?

      Easy turns to glare at Junior and the surly field hand slaps
      his thigh and roars with laughter as he closes the door.
      After all these years the two men still hate each other.

20    INT. JOHN'S SPEAKEASY                                          20

      Easy looks around to see couples trying to dance; finding
      themselves wrestling between tables packed with five and six
      people each.

      He heads for the bar pointing a finger at a man in a black
      silk shirt and a foot-high pompadour hairdo.

                                EASY
                   Alphonso Jenkins!

      ALPHONSO flashes pearls.

                                 ALPHONSO
                   Hey, Easy!

                                EASY
                   Hey, man, you seen a girl named
                   Dahlia or somethin'... White girl
                   supposed to be somethin' to look
                   at.

                                                                19.

20   CONTINUED:                                                       20

                                ALPHONSO
                   Naw, but if I see her I'm gonna
                   keep her to myself.

     Easy claps him on the shoulder and waves at skinny RITA COOK
     who is sitting at a table with five MEN.

                                 RITA
                   Hey, Baby.

                                EASY
                   Hey, Rita!
                         (under his breath)
                   What do they see in you?

     Finally, Easy spots a fifty-year-old MAN in an old grey
     tweed jacket sitting in a corner at a table by himself.
     Looking like the God fearing, all fearing Baptist deacon
     that he is -- he is as out of place as a whore in church as
     he nervously gazes about the room and massacres a plate of
     barbecued ribs.

     Easy leans over the counter to the bartender.

                                EASY
                   Hey, Lewis. Gimme a couple glasses
                   and a pail of ice and send a quart
                   of bourbon over there to Odell's
                   table.

     Lewis scoops up ice into a small bucket and plops it onto
     the bar with two short glasses.

     Easy lays a dollar on the counter and carries the set up
     over to the corner as he watches...

     THE BAND

     burn it up.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Easy stops at Odell's table.

                                 EASY
                   Hey, Odell.

                                 ODELL
                   Easy.

                                EASY
                   How's it going tonight?

     Odell doesn't miss a bite as he scopes the crowd.

                                                             20.

                               ODELL
                        (slowly)
                  Well... It's goin' alright.   It
                  sure is goin'.

                               O.S. VOICE
                  Easy Rawlins, is that you?

     Easy looks up to see

     DUPREE, a big black man with a wide white grin in a white
     suite with blue pinstripes and a ten-gallon hat.

                               DUPREE
                  You ain't jumped outta no windows
                  yet?

                               EASY
                  Not yet, Dupree.

                               DUPREE
                  Miss you down at the plant... You
                  know Coretta, don't ya?

     He has her in tow like a toy wagon and she offers a coy
     smile. Short and roundish with cherry-brown skin, she leads
     with her bosom.

                               EASY
                  Hey, Coretta, how are ya?

     Coretta rests her sloe-eyes on Easy and Odell and the church
     going man almost chokes.

                               ODELL
                  Oh, my goodness.

                               CORETTA
                  Could we sit down with y'all?

                                  EASY
                  Sure.   Sure.

     Dupree and Coretta settle in.

                               DUPREE
                  You know Benny just wants you to
                  say you're sorry, Easy. And he'll
                  give you your job back.

                               EASY
                  I'm a sorry man, all right. Any
                  man without his paycheck is sorry.

                                                                21.

20   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 20

     Dupree laughs, smacking the table so hard it rattles like an
     earthquake. And Coretta's smile ignites like a slow fuse
     causing Easy to feel it all the way down his spine.

     A man with his hair marcelled back swoops in and pulls a
     quart of Old Crow from his overcoat and sits it on the
     table.

     Easy reaches for his wallet but Dupree beats him to it.

                               DUPREE
                  I got it, Easy. Your money ain't
                  no good up in here.

                                 EASY
                  Naw, Dupree.    This one's mine--

                                DUPREE
                  You sure?   You the one outta work.

     Coretta frowns at Dupree as Easy counts out three dollars.

                               CORETTA
                  And you're the one ain't never got
                  no money.

                               DUPREE
                  Aw, Baby...
                        (to bootlegger)
                  Get us another couple glasses.

     And he peels off a dollar and hands it off.

                               EASY
                  Either one of y'all seen a white
                  girl named Dahlia or somethin' with
                  a 'D'?

     Odell shakes his head "no," and Coretta looks away as if
     insulted leaving silence until

                               DUPREE
                  Hey, Coretta got a new job at the
                  phone company.

     He squeezes his woman in close and Coretta softens up and
     burns that smile again.

     Easy grins and nods "congratulations."

21   THE BOTTLE                                                       21

     It's less than a quarter full now because it's three hours
     later.

                                                                22.

     BACK TO SCENE

     John's is only half full and the band is gone. The jukebox
     echoes Lena Horne's "Prisoner of Love" and Dupree leans back
     in his chair, snoring -- mouth wide open.

     Odell gets up and starts to amble off.

                               EASY
                  Hey, you goin' home, Odell?

     Concentrating totally on keeping his balance, Odell waves
     feebly without looking back.

     Easy is droopy-eyed from the booze but Coretta just looks a
     little sexier. She straightens Dupree's hat on his head and
     twists up her nose.

                               CORETTA
                  He used to play till the cock
                  crowed. But that ole cock don't
                  crow nearly so much now...

     She levels her perpetual "come on" onto Easy and he nods
     sluggishly and lifts himself to his feet.

                               EASY
                  Think I'm gonna head out.

                               CORETTA
                  You be sorry if you go.

     She slides her hand inside her blouse and discreetly lifts
     her bodice to air her breasts.

                               EASY
                  I think I'd be more sorry if I
                  stay...

     He turns to go.

                               CORETTA
                  Daphne sleep by now. You can't get
                  none of that tonight.

     Easy turns and Coretta plays with the ice in her glass.

                               CORETTA
                  You been telling everybody Dahlia,
                  but her name is Daphne.

                               EASY
                  You know her?

                                                             23.

     Coretta leans back and fans her bosom.

22   EXT. CORETTA'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  22

     Easy struggles with Dupree, and Coretta gives him a hand as
     they drag him from Easy's car to her front door, the big
     man's feet plowing two deep furrows in the lawn.

23   INT. CORETTA'S HOUSE                                          23

     Coretta pushes the door open and Easy hauls him in.

                                CORETTA
                   Throw him in there on the bed,
                   Easy.

     Easy pulls and pushes Dupree's dead weight into

     THE BEDROOM

                                CORETTA
                   Throwed him outta his place, 'cause
                   he couldn't pay the rent. I
                   shouldn't even let him sleep here.

     Finally Easy manages to pile Dupree onto the bed and then
     stands up panting and sweating.

                                EASY
                   Damn...

     Coretta leads him out into

24   THE LIVING ROOM                                               24

                                EASY
                   I need a cigarette.

     Coretta shines her hazel eyes on him.

                                CORETTA
                   That all you need?

     Easy grins nervously and clears his throat.

                                EASY
                   Coretta, sun catch me tip-toein'

                  Dupree run through his money, fall
                  asleep on me. And you just gonna
                  walk out on me like I was dog
                  food...

                               EASY
                  You got a man in the other room...
                  Why don't you tell me 'bout your
                  friend Daphne?

     Coretta strolls up to Easy, pressing her body against his.

                               CORETTA
                  Why you keep askin' 'bout her?
                  Colored women ain't good enough for
                  you no more?

     She undoes a button on his shirt and kisses his chest, and
     unbuttons another working her way down. Easy sweats harder
     than when he was lifting Dupree.

                               EASY
                  What if he hears somethin'?

                               CORETTA (O.S.)
                  Way he snorin'?

     ON THE SOFA - MINUTES LATER

                               CORETTA
                  Oh yeah, daddy. You hittin' my
                  spot! Oh yeah... yeah!

     The top of her dress undone, Coretta is straddling Easy who
     is hitting her spot and his too, in a rhythm. Eyes
     closed, he bites his lip to hold in the ecstasy so as not to
     awaken Dupree, who is sawing logs -- shredding 'em -- in the
     bedroom.

     Suddenly Coretta tears herself off of him and sits back on
     his knees. Easy writhes and shakes like a power line
     shorting out.

                               CORETTA
                        (coy, shy)
                  Oooh, that's just too good, Easy.

     Easy tries to pull her back but she twists down to the
     floor.

                               CORETTA
                  I can't give up that much love,
                  daddy, not the way things is.

                                                             25.

                        (out loud)
                  What things?

     She shushes him with a finger and twists her head toward the
     bedroom.

                               CORETTA
                  You know, Dupree's right there in
                  the next room.

                               EASY
                        (full voice)
                  Forget about him! You got me
                  goin', Coretta!

     Coretta quiets him again and he comes back to his senses.

                               CORETTA
                  But it ain't right, Easy. Here I
                  am doin' this right in the next
                  room and all you doin' is nosin'
                  after my friend Daphne...

                  Daphne?
                        (and then remembers)
                  Oh, yeah... I ain't after her,
                  baby. That's just a job.

                               CORETTA
                  What job?

                               EASY
                  Man wants me to find her.

                               CORETTA
                  What man?

                               EASY
                  Who cares, what man?   I don't want
                  nobody but you...

     He pulls her toward him but she pushes him away.

                               CORETTA
                  But Daphne's my friend--

     Frustrated, he sits back against the sofa and Coretta,
     sensing that he is snapping out of her spell, slides forward
     onto him giving him her spot again. And within moments
     they are back at it.

                                                                26.

                  I went on hittin' her spot until
                  just before sun-up.

     The sky is light purple as Easy stumbles down Coretta's
     porch. She waves half-heartedly and closes the door as he
     straightens his clothes and looks around for any "witnesses"
     on his way to his car.

     Easy's Pontiac pulls to a stop in front and he gets out.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  It occurred to me that Coretta had
                  found out a lot more about what I
                  was up to than I had wanted her to.
                  But I had found out that the rich
                  man's woman had a colored
                  boyfriend... It had cost me a
                  sawbuck to get Coretta to give me
                  that information... Well, let's
                  just say somethin' had cost me ten
                  dollars.

     Golden morning light streams in through the window.
     Outside, a dog is barking at a bird on the fence.

     Coffee percolates on the stove and Easy walks over and pours
     himself a cup. He moves to the breakfast table and sits
     down by the window looking out onto the street as he opens
     up a blue envelope in a stack of mail.

     Gradually he begins to silently mouth the words and sits up,
     his eyes getting bigger until he finds himself reading
     aloud.

                  The letter from Mouse was worrying
                  me in more ways than one... All I
                  had to do was call Albright to earn
                  the hundred dollars I already had
                  in my pocket... But the last time I
                  got money that easy I got it from
                  Mouse -- fifty dollars -- And the
                  next day I had to join the Army to
                  leave town.

     A younger Easy is driving, his hair greased up high in a
     pompadour with a pencil line moustache framing his top lip.

     A man in a wide brim Homburg hat looks away out the
     passenger window.

                  Drive to the trainyard, Easy!

     The drone of the engine takes us

30   BACK TO SCENE                                                 30

     A TRUCK with a whole family's belongings tied down onto a
     flatbed rolls up. A WOMAN and a bunch of KIDS fill up the
     cab.

                               WOMAN

                   me out here.

     She waves and keeps on trucking.

     He watches her wistfully and then catches sight of

     THE WOODCUTTER across the street in a neighbor's front yard,
     axe in hand, about to swing on a lemon tree.

                                EASY
                   Get away from there!

     He picks up a rock and throws it, and then chucks another
     sending the scruffy vagabond wheeling his barrow off down
     the street.

     Easy shuts off the water and walks back up on his porch.    He
     picks up a glass of lemonade that sits at the foot of a
     chair on top of

     A NEWSPAPER

     A front page heading reads "CARTER'S WITHDRAWAL LEAVES TERAN
     ON TOP." Below it

     A PHOTOGRAPH of a smiling Matthew Teran, with lips too thick
     for a white man, getting out of a limousine.

      breath.

      The headlights from Easy's car illuminate the cliffs that

                   drove out there in the daytime, did
                   my work and came home. I never
                   loitered nowhere except among my
                   own people, in my own neighborhood.

A35   EXT. MALIBU PIER - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                           A35

      The lights from the   pier can be seen in the distance as Easy
      parks his car. And    the voices of teenagers in raucous
      conversation can be   heard above Glenn Miller's big band
      playing "Silhouette   In The Moonlight" on the jukebox.

                                                               30.

      Easy gets out and starts toward the pier.

35    EXT. MALIBU PIER - NIGHT                                       35

      Easy walks past the hamburger stand and on to the railing
      that looks out over the ocean.

                                 O.S. VOICE
                   Hi.

      He spins around and sees a chubby 17-year-old white GIRL in
      a tight-fitting skirt.

      He nods respectfully and turns away to look out at the
      water, hoping she'll leave.

                                GIRL
                   It's pretty out here, huh?

                                 EASY
                   Yeah.   It's all right.

                                 GIRL
                   I'm from Des Moines in Iowa.    Where
                   are you from?

                                EASY
                         (without looking back)
                   Huh?... Uh... Texas...

                                GIRL
                   Do they have an ocean in Texas?

                                EASY
                   The Gulf, they have the Gulf.

      She leans on the rail next to Easy and he glances over his
      shoulder, seeing a couple of the young men looking around
      like they've lost someone.

                                EASY
                   I think they're looking for you.

                                BARBARA
                   Who cares? My sister brought me
                   'cause my parents made her. All
                   she wants to do is make out with
                   Herman and smoke cigarettes.

                                 PIMPLY-FACED BOY
                   Hey, you!   What are you doing?

      The five-foot-six-inch twenty-year-old charges straight up
      to Easy.

                                                                31.

                                BARBARA
                        (yelling)
                  Leave him alone, Herman!   We were
                  just talking!

                                HERMAN
                  You were, huh?
                         (to Easy)
                  We don't need you talking to our
                  women.

     Easy braces himself as five of Herman's FRIENDS rush over,
     including one built like a football player.

                                FOOTBALL
                  Hey!   What's wrong?

                               HERMAN
                  Nigger's trying to pick up Barbara.

                               BARBARA
                  Leave him alone! We were just
                  talking about the ocean!

                                BARBARA'S SISTER
                  Barbara!

     Football gets right in Easy's face.

                               FOOTBALL
                  Hey, fella, what's wrong with you?

     A couple of the other boys have picked up sticks and are
     surrounding Easy against the rail.

                               EASY
                  I don't want no trouble.

                               FOOTBALL
                  You already got trouble, boy.

                               EASY
                  Listen... I was just being polite.

                               HERMAN
                  No, you weren't. You were talkin'
                  about the ocean!

                                O.S. VOICE
                  Excuse me.

     Easy sees Albright's Panama hat appear behind Football.

                                                                32.

                               FOOTBALL
                  What do you want?

     And he whirls around to Albright's smiling face, just in
     time to see him pull that rifle-like pistol from inside his
     coat, leveling it at his eyes.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I want to see brains.    I want you
                  to die for me.

     Albright cocks the hammer. It sounds like a bone breaking,
     and Barbara starts crying in her sister's arms.

                               FOOTBALL
                        (quickly)
                  I'm sorry, sir.

     Easy nods but Albright is not satisfied.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  The question is: "Are you sorry
                  enough?"

                               FOOTBALL
                  Yessir.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Then prove it... Show him... Get
                  down on your knees and suck his
                  peter.

     Football starts crying.

                               EASY
                        (to Albright)
                  I think he got the point--

                                ALBRIGHT
                        (to Football)
                  You heard me.

     He presses the barrel to the boy's forehead and Football
     goes down to his knees. The other young men look on in
     horror.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Son of a gun. You were gonna do
                  it, weren't you?

     THUNK! He slaps the barrel of the pistol into the side of
     the boy's head. Football screams and the others scatter.

                                                                33.

35   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 35

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Sick bastard.

     THUNK!   He smacks him again, and blood is everywhere.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Get out of here. You call the
                  cops, I'll kill ya!

     Football manages to stagger to his feet and stumbles away
     into the darkness back out toward the parking lot.

36   Albright wipes his gun with a handkerchief and slides it         36
     back into the holster.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I don't think they'd dare call the
                  cops.
                        (giggles)
                  But it'll cost me a few bucks if
                  they do.

     He claps Easy on the back as if it's all been in fun and
     giggles like a kid on his way toward the hamburger stand.

     Easy looks at him numbly and tags alongside, clutching his
     anger in tightly clenched jaws.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  What you got, Easy?

                               EASY
                  You sure no harm is gonna come to
                  that woman 'cause of me?

     Albright doesn't break stride.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Course not. Mr. Carter wants to
                  buy her a gold ring and live
                  happily ever after -- What do ya
                  got?

     Easy exhales, feeling trapped, but he's come this far...

                               EASY
                  Woman told me she's with a man
                  named Frank Green.

     Albright stops; the charm gone, he's all business.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Where?

                                                             34.

36   CONTINUED:                                                    36

                               EASY
                  He's got an apartment at the Skyler
                  Arms on Skyler and Eighty-third.

     Albright scribbles it down on a note pad.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Anything else?

                               EASY
                  Frank's a gangster. A hijacker...
                  Liquor and cigarettes. He's real
                  good with a knife.

     Albright is unable to suppress a smile.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Ever seen him in action?

                                EASY
                  Naw.   I just heard about him.

     Albright, still grinning, pulls out the brown "secretary"
     and counts out more bills.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Here's another hundred.

     He shoves the money into Easy's hand.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Buy ya a burger, Easy?

     He starts into the screen door of the hamburger stand but
     Easy declines.

                               EASY
                  No thanks, Mr. Albright.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  How come you let those boys get
                  around you like that? War hero
                  should have been able to pick 'em
                  off one by one before they got you
                  against the rail.

                               EASY
                  I don't kill children.

     For some reason this is hilarious to Albright. He throws
     his head back and wheezes out an almost silent belly laugh,
     then winds down.

                                                                35.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                  Take it easy.

     He disappears into the hamburger joint and Easy walks away
     back toward his car.

37   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        37

     Easy pulls in front of his house and notices a dark Ford
     parked across the street as he gets out of his car.

     A tall, skinny white MAN in a dark blue suit gets out just
     ahead of his slightly shorter and heavyset FRIEND.

     Easy watches them as he moves toward his walkway.

                                 SKINNY MAN
                  Mr. Rawlins.

                                 EASY
                  Yeah.

     They approach fast but cautiously, the fat one with a hand
     in his pocket.

                               SKINNY MAN
                  Mr. Rawlins, I'm Miller and this is
                  my partner, Mason.

     They both hold out badges. Mason is a slob with grease
     spots on his wrinkled tan suit.

                               MILLER
                  We want you to come with us.

                                 EASY
                  Where?

                                 MASON
                  You'll see.

     And he takes Easy by the arm.

                               EASY
                  You arresting me?

                                 MASON
                  You'll see.

     And he starts pulling Easy toward the street.

                               EASY
                  I got a right to know why you're
                  taking--

                                                               36.

37   CONTINUED:                                                      37

     WHOMP! Easy takes one to the diaphragm, and as he doubles
     over the fat detective slips the handcuffs on behind his
     back.

                                MASON
                  You got a right to fall down and
                  break your face, nigger. You got a
                  right to die.

     The two cops drag Easy to the car and dump him into the back
     seat where he lies gagging as the car whisks away.

38   INT. POLICE STATION                                             38

     Easy's head sags down as he's dragged through the front door
     past blurred blue bodies that talk.

                               POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                  You got 'im, huh, Miller?

                               MILLER (O.S.)
                  Yeah, we got him coming home.
                  Nothing on 'im.

     A door opens and Easy finds himself being flung inside.

39   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM                                         39

     On his knees he hears the door close and looks up at a
     single, bare wooden chair resting on the corroded linoleum
     floor.

     He crawls to one of the urine-stained corners, and looks down
     on a dry, flat corpse of a mouse. He pushes his shoulder
     against the unpainted plaster until he's standing and then
     stumbles over to the chair and sits. He looks up at the
     bare pipes that run along the ceiling, dripping water, and
     at a window with criss-cross chairs instead of glass framing,
     overgrown branches and leaves pushing their way in.

     THE DOOR opens and Miller comes in first carrying a
     notebook.

                               MILLER
                  Ezekiel Rawlins.

                               EASY
                  Yes, sir.

     Mason follows and closes the door.

                               MILLER
                  We can take off the cuffs if you
                  wanna cooperate.

                                                              37.

39   CONTINUED:                                                     39

                               EASY
                  I'm cooperating.

     Miller motions to Mason and he removes the cuffs.

                               MILLER
                  Where were you this morning at
                  about five A.M.?

                               EASY
                        (stalling)
                  What do you mean?

                               MASON
                  He means--

     He plants his foot in Easy's chest and pushes him over
     backwards.

                               MASON
                  --this morning.

     Easy has caught himself and stands back up.

                               EASY
                  I don't know... I was out drinkin'
                  and I helped carry a friend home.
                  I could've been on my way home... I
                  don't know... I didn't look at a
                  clock...

                               MASON
                        (wandering over)
                  He didn't look at a clock.

     WHOCK! Easy takes a fist to the ear and struggles to keep
     his balance, wiping away blood streaming down.

                               MILLER
                  You were drinkin' down on Eighty-
                  ninth and Central... At an illegal
                  club called John's, weren't you?

     Mason moves again but this time Easy turns to face him and
     the fat man looks back with an innocent face, his palms
     turned up.

                               MILLER
                  You may as well answer 'cause you
                  got bigger troubles than us bustin'
                  an illegal bar, Ezekiel.

                               EASY
                  What do you mean?    What's goin' on?

                                                             38.

39   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              39

     Mason has taken off his shoe and is swatting it against the
     palm of his hand.

                               MASON
                  Means we can take your black ass
                  out behind the station and put a
                  bullet in your head.

                               MILLER
                  Now. What time did you leave
                  Coretta James' house this morning?

                               EASY
                  I guess about five... five-
                  thirty...

     Miller and Mason glance at each other, and Mason kicks the
     chair over toward Easy.

                                MASON
                  Sit down.

                               EASY
                  Why, I'm gonna sit down and you
                  keep trying to knock me down?

     But he sits down anyway.

                               MILLER
                  Did you go back and see Miss James
                  later in the day?

                                EASY
                  No, sir.

                               MILLER
                  Did you and Dupree Brouchard have
                  words over Miss James?

                                EASY
                  Huh?

                               MASON
                  You heard 'im. Did you two argue
                  over Coretta James?

                                EASY
                  Naw.   He was asleep.

                               MILLER
                  She went to sleep too, Ezekiel.
                  But she won't be waking up...

     Easy's face goes sick...

                                                               39.

39   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                39

                                MILLER
                        (continuing)
                  Where'd you go when you left Miss
                  James' house?

     Easy is too stunned to answer.

                               MASON
                  You heard him, where'd you go?

     Easy stares into space, answering in barely a whisper.

                               EASY
                  I went home with a hangover...

     CHOONK! CHOONK! Mason fires off two punches and Easy grabs
     his wrists and pulls him down to the floor, swinging around,
     straddling Mason sitting on his ass...

     Miller's police special presses into Easy's temple and
     Miller speaks to him quietly, deadly.

                               MILLER
                  Get up slow... Real fuckin' slow or
                  you know what's gonna happen.

     Easy raises his hands and uncoils to his feet, backing away
     cautiously.

     Mason is winded and furious.

                                MASON
                  Okay.   Let's take him out back.

     He gets to his feet and reaches for his gun, but Miller
     stops his hand.

                                MILLER
                  No.   Let's go.

                               MASON
                  Bullshit, I'm gonna blow his--

                                MILLER
                  Let's go!

     He pushes Mason toward the door.

                               MASON
                  Son-of-a-bitch! Son-of-a-bitch!

     They exit the door and Easy rubs at his bloody ear.

                                                               40.

40   EXT. L.A. CITY JAIL - NIGHT                                     40

     Easy walks down the steps of the station buttoning up his
     top shirt button, his hand cupped to his aching ear to keep
     out the chill of the night air.

     The street is dark and deserted like a giant black alley
     except for the black and white patrol car that sits at the
     curb. A taut-faced officer leans out the window.

                              OFFICER
                 Hey, Buddy!... It's a long walk...
                 why don't you let us give you a
                 ride?

     Easy walks across the street off into the darkness...

41   EXT. FOURTH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT                               41

     A snatch of MUSIC and LAUGHTER startles Easy as he trudges
     home and a car full of teenagers shoots by. And then...

     A BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE

     cruises up behind and drives alongside.

                               VOICE FROM CAR
                 Hey, you!   Ezekiel Rawlins!

     The window rolls down all the way and a white face in a
     black cap appears in the window.

                              CHAUFFEUR
                 Ezekiel, hold on.

     Easy keeps walking.

                              CHAUFFEUR
                 Come on, fella. Somebody in the
                 back wants to talk to you.

                              EASY
                 I don't have time right now.

     He doubles his pace, almost running.

                              CHAUFFEUR
                 Jump in. We'll take you.    My boss
                 wants to talk to you.

     Easy cuts behind the limo and into the street headed for the
     other side of the bridge but

                                                               41.

41   CONTINUED:                                                      41

     The Cadillac whips a U-turn blocking his way in the middle
     of the street while cars pass, honking, on either side. The
     tall angular chauffeur gets out of the car and holds up his
     hands as if making peace.

     Easy starts to make another move to escape but:

                               CHAUFFEUR
                        (continuing)
                  Come on. If we wanted to hurt you
                  it would have already happened...

     He opens the back door and after a few moments, Easy gets
     in.

42   INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                                          42

     Easy settles into the seat with his back to the driver.

     Edith Piaf's "Parles Moi D'Amour" adds sugar to the strong
     smell of cologne and the portly form of Matthew Teran sits
     across from him with a small MEXICAN BOY in pajamas seated
     next to him holding a small elephant.

                               TERAN
                  I can see that the police roughed
                  you up a bit... That's a terrible
                  practice of theirs which has to
                  change, Mr. Rawlins... Has to
                  change.

     He opens his gold cigarette case and offers Easy a
     cigarette. Easy accepts and Teran lights them both up.

                               TERAN
                        (continuing)
                  She was beaten. And died from a
                  heavy blow to the back of the head,
                  Mr. Rawlins.

     Easy begins to feel nauseous.

                               TERAN
                  The evening's events have caught my
                  adopted son and I quite off
                  guard... My household was asleep
                  when we got the call that the
                  police had a suspect in Coretta
                  James' murder... Did you know that
                  she was a friend of mine, Mr.
                  Rawlins!?

                               EASY
                  No I didn't, Mr. Teran.

                                                             42.

42   CONTINUED:                                                    42

                               TERAN
                  Oh, you know who I am?

                               EASY
                  I read the papers.   You're runnin'
                  for mayor.

                               TERAN
                        (correcting)
                  I am the next mayor, Mr. Rawlins...
                  And luckily for you, a friend of
                  the Negro... When I arrived at the
                  station I knew right off that you
                  were being improperly detained as
                  is Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree
                  Brouchard. It's this sort of thing
                  that my administration will not
                  tolerate, Mr. Rawlins. Absolutely
                  will not...

     He sits back in his seat self righteously and offers a nod
     of assurance and awaits Easy's gratitude... Then after a
     moment...

                               TERAN
                        (continuing)
                  Yes... Coretta answered phones for
                  a while in my campaign office on
                  103rd and Western. In fact my
                  people got her a job in the phone
                  company. So when I heard what had
                  happened I got out of bed
                  immediately, personally because of
                  my concern... Was anyone there with
                  you Mr. Rawlins besides Mr. Dupree
                  Brouchard?... Any... other friends
                  of Coretta's?

                               EASY
                  No, sir...

                               TERAN
                  No young lady perhaps?

                               EASY
                  Nobody...

                               TERAN
                  Of course not, Mr. Rawlins. And
                  why should you tell a man whom
                  you've only just met. But, believe
                  me, Mr. Rawlins. You can trust me.

                                                                43.

42   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 42

                               EASY
                        (shrugging)
                  There was no one else.

     Teran's face sags with disappointment and then...

                               TERAN
                  Well don't worry, Mr. Rawlins... I
                  won't tolerate your being
                  harassed... You or any of my
                  constituency -- I was a city
                  councilman in the Watts area for
                  two terms with a large contingent
                  of colored -- I value all of my
                  supporters equally... humble though
                  they may be -- where can we drop
                  you, Mr. Rawlins?

                               EASY
                  You can let me out here.

                               TERAN
                  Are you sure, Mr. Rawlins? This
                  must be quite out of your way.

                               EASY
                  It's okay.

     The little boy stares up at Easy through big, dark almond-
     shaped eyes in the silence that follows. And then, Teran
     picks up the ivory horn that hangs next to his head.

                               TERAN
                  Norman, pull the car over.

43   EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT                                      43

     The limousine stops and Easy pushes the door open and gets
     out.

                               TERAN
                  Mr. Rawlins, may I offer you cab
                  fare?

     Teran's stubby fingers hold out crumpled bills.

                               EASY
                  No thanks.

     Easy closes the door and watches the long Cadillac glide
     away.

                                                               44.

43   CONTINUED:                                                      43

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  There had been nights during the
                  war that I still had trouble
                  claiming as part of my life...
                  Insane nights I wasn't sure ever
                  really happened. And here I was
                  again... Had I really just gotten
                  out of a rich man's car who was
                  runnin' for mayor?.. Running
                  against the man I was supposed to
                  be working for... Was he really
                  lookin' for the same woman I was
                  trying to find? My ear was killin'
                  me and the buses had stopped
                  running. And I was feeling sick...
                  Sick from wondering if I had really
                  hard that Coretta was dead.

44   INT. EASY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM                                     44

     The room is a mess; trousers strewn here, shirt and shoes
     over there. And from the corners are haunting, ghostly
     whispers.

                               CORETTA'S VOICE
                  You be sorry if you go...
                        (heavy breathing)
                  I can't give up that much love,
                  daddy, not the way things is.

     A PINT OF BOURBON, 3/4 full, sits atop the cherry wood
     nightstand. Another empty bottle lies next to it on its
     side, in front of a water glass with 1/2 inch of liquor at
     the bottom.

     EASY'S HEAD rests on a pillow on the bed behind it,
     sweating, tossing and turning as the ghost gets louder.

                               CORETTA'S VOICE
                  Oh yeah, daddy. You hittin' my
                  spot... Oh yeah... oh yeah...

     The voice of the ghost is reaching closer for his ear.

                               CORETTA'S VOICE
                  Oh, that's just too good, Easy.   Oh
                  daddy... oh yeah...

     The voice is right up in his face.

                              CORETTA'S VOICE
                  Oh, baby. Oh, daddy, yeah... Oh
                  yeah!! Oh Yea-a-h!!

                                                              45.

44   CONTINUED:                                                     44

     SCREAM. He jerks up, awake, and the phone is RINGING.    It
     jingles a couple more times and Easy almost knocks the
     receiver out of its cradle reaching for it.

                                 EASY
                  Huh?

                               VOICE
                        (a woman's)
                  Hello? Is this Mr. Rawlins?

                                 EASY
                  Who is this?

                               VOICE
                  Daphne... Daphne Monet...

     He sits straight up.

                               DAPHNE
                  You're looking for me.

     A pause on the line.

                               DAPHNE
                  I think you should come and talk to
                  me, Mr. Rawlins... alone.

                               EASY
                  Look, it's late--

                               DAPHNE
                  Mr. Rawlins, Coretta has been
                  killed...

     Another pause.

                               DAPHNE
                  And if you don't want any trouble
                  from the police then you'll come...
                  And you won't tell anyone that
                  you're coming.

                               EASY
                  Now wait a minute, Daphne. I don't
                  know nothin' about all this
                  stuff...

                               DAPHNE
                  I'm at the Sunridge Motel on 112th
                  and Grand, Room 102.

                                                                46.

44   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 44

     Easy holds his hands up, helplessly -- "what do you want
     from me?" -- but no one can see and she has hung up the
     phone.

45   EXT. SUNRIDGE MOTEL - NIGHT                                      45

     It's a Spanish-style set of rooms with tile roofs set around
     a square parking lot.

     Easy's car pulls into the alley behind it.

     He gets out and scans the area looking down from a rise at
     the back entrance to the parking lot. And then walks down.

46   OMIT                                                             46

47   EXT. SUNRIDGE MOTEL - ROOM 102 - NIGHT                           47

     Before Easy can knock, he hears:

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                  Mr. Rawlins?

                                 EASY
                  Yeah.

     The door opens and she's standing there, more beautiful than
     the photograph. They take each other in for a moment before
     she steps back from the door.

                               DAPHNE
                  Please come in.

48   INT. MOTEL ROOM                                                  48

     It's a regular drab, cheap motel that she has given a warmer
     touch with colorful scarves draped over the two lamps.

                               DAPHNE
                  Would you like a drink?

     She indicates a pint of scotch on the dresser with an empty
     glass and one that she's been drinking from.

                                 EASY
                  No, thanks.

     She indicates the chair.

                               DAPHNE
                  Please sit down.

     She's wearing a blue dress that's plain, cutting just below
     her knee with a ceramic pin just over her left breast.

                                                             47.

48   CONTINUED:                                                     48

                               DAPHNE
                  What happened to you?   Have you
                  been fighting?

     Easy stubs out his cigarette in an ashtray and sits down.

                               EASY
                  Why don't you just tell me what you
                  want?

     She sits down too, her calm but brittle exterior betrayed at
     the hands. She stops wringing them when she sees that he
     notices and takes a drink -- more medicine than pleasure.

                               DAPHNE
                  I should be asking you that
                  question. Why have you been asking
                  about me?

                               EASY
                  I heard about you. Fellas at
                  John's said you were something to
                  see.

                                DAPHNE
                  So...?   You've found me.

                               EASY
                  Uh... yeah... Guess I have. But
                  you got a boyfriend I don't want no
                  part of... Frank Green.

     She lights a cigarette.

                               DAPHNE
                  You can stop pretending, Mr.
                  Rawlins. I know someone hired you
                  to look for me. In fact I had to
                  pay Coretta not to tell you where I
                  was... you know how Coretta is...
                        (forces a weak smile)
                  She told me you two became 'good
                  friends' yesterday...
                        (tears gather in her
                         eyes)
                  I talked to her this morning before
                  she died.
                        (regaining control)
                  I... uh... need to go across town
                  to see someone. It's very
                  important... I can't seem to reach
                  him by phone. I'm afraid I'd
                  better have someone go with me.

                                                                48.

                  Uh... Miss Monet--

                               DAPHNE
                  Call me Daphne.

                               EASY
                  Daphne--

                               DAPHNE
                  I can understand why you'd be
                  nervous... because I threatened you
                  with Coretta... I'm very sorry, but
                  I couldn't think of any other way
                  to get you to come.

     She takes another drink and stubs out her cigarette though
     it's less than a third gone.

                               EASY
                  I can't -- why don't you ask Frank?

     She gets up and starts to pace nervously about the room.

                               DAPHNE
                  He's out of town -- I... I'm
                  willing to pay you.

                               EASY
                  That's nice of you but, see, I'm
                  not really a detective--

                               DAPHNE
                  --I know that.

                               EASY
                  I was just hired to ask around to
                  try to find you for a man--

                               DAPHNE
                  I know all about that, Mr. Rawlins.

                               EASY
                  But this is a gettin' a little out of
                  hand--

                               DAPHNE
                  --Mr. Rawlins--

                               EASY
                  --Easy.

                  Easy... If you don't help me, then
                  I'll call the police and tell them
                  that you were with Coretta before
                  she died and that you've been after
                  me too.

     That stops Easy.

                               EASY
                  You'd do that?

                                 DAPHNE
                  Yes, I would.    I don't want to but
                  I would.

     She hates herself for threatening and decides to change
     direction, moving in close.

                               DAPHNE
                  Please let me pay you.

                                 EASY
                  No.    I can't do that.

                                 DAPHNE
                  Why?

                               EASY
                  I don't want no part of all this.

                  Please, I'll pay you twenty
                  dollars.

                                 EASY
                  No dice.

                               DAPHNE
                  Thirty... or even more.    Name your
                  price.

     She moves in closer, massaging with her voice.

                               DAPHNE
                        (continuing)
                  Go ahead. There's gotta be
                  something that you want.

     Her eyes make an offer, but he's a better man than me and
     he's not taking.

                                                              50.

                         sarcastically)
                  What? Are you afraid I'll yell
                  rape or something?

     She walks away and turns up her glass, her desperation, raw,
     unguarded.

                  Uh, Miss Monet... Daphne, I'm sorry
                  but I really better be goin'.

     He starts out and she runs to stop him.

                               DAPHNE
                  Easy, don't touch that door--

     He opens it and

     SCREAM!   Like an alarm, she's SHRIEKING all of the scale.

49   He looks out and sees                                          49

     LIGHTS GOING ON in other rooms.

50   BACK TO SCENE                                                  50

     He looks back frantically and grabs her by the shoulders.

                               EASY
                  Crazy assed broad!   What the hell
                  are you doing?!

                  I'm really very sorry.   I really
                  am.

     She pulls on a coat and grabs her purse.

                               DAPHNE
                        (continuing)
                  I didn't want to do this but...
                  Shall we?

     She grabs an already packed suitcase and is out the door.

51   EXT. LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT                                     51

     Easy's Pontiac snakes up the winding road, city lights
     glimmering in flashes below as it rounds the curves.

                                                               51.

52   INT. EASY'S CAR - NIGHT                                         52

     Ben Webster's "I've   Got It Bad" plays on the road as Easy
     shifts nervously in   his seat, his eyes searching in the
     rearview mirror and   all around for headlights that might be
     unfriendly. Daphne    leans back against the passenger door,
     taking him in.

     Easy passes a police car pulled over to the side.

     He looks in the rearview mirror and its headlights go on.
     He takes a deep breath, bracing for the worst and Daphne
     looks back concerned.

     But the lights arch a U-turn and head back the other way.

                              DAPHNE
                 They must not have seen us that
                 well... God, Frank and I have been
                 pulled over so many times I
                 thought--

     She catches herself and looks over at Easy.

                              DAPHNE
                       (continuing)
                 Easy, I'm sorry... Don't be mad at
                 me.

     Easy keeps his eyes on the road.

                       (continuing)
                 Come on.

     She tries to touch his arm and he pulls away.

                              DAPHNE
                       (continuing)
                 You really hate me, don't you?

                              EASY
                 How much further is it?

                               DAPHNE
                 Around the next bend...
                        (she grins)
                 You remind me of Frank when he gets
                 angry.

                              EASY
                 Ain't nothin' about me like Frank.

                              DAPHNE
                 Your jaw sets just like his when--

                                                               52.

                               EASY
                  I don't get no kick outta risking
                  my life for some white woman's
                  entertainment.

                               DAPHNE
                        (sighing)
                  Just park behind the Studebaker.

53   EXT. RICHARD'S CABIN / INT. EASY'S PONTIAC                      53

     The Studebaker is parked at a deadend in the street.    Easy
     pulls in behind.

     The cabin is so overgrown with ivy that all this is visible
     is the mailbox and address.

                               DAPHNE
                  Did you bring a gun or something?

                                EASY
                  What?   No.

                               DAPHNE
                  Easy, that's not very smart.
                  Everybody carries a weapon now a
                  days.

                               EASY
                        (defensively)
                  Well then where's yours?

                               DAPHNE
                  Search me sometime.   You'll find
                  it.

     She gets out of the car.

                                EASY
                  Damn...

     He frowns and gets out of the car.

54   OMIT                                                            54

55   EXT. RICHARD'S CABIN - NIGHT                                    55

     Daphne waits, clutching her suitcase and lets Easy lead the
     way.

     They get to the door and find it ajar.    Easy takes a look
     inside and then cautiously steps in.

                                                                   53.

56   INT. RICHARD'S CABIN - NIGHT                                        56

     He flicks on the wall switch. It's a typical little
     hideaway that the rich kept for summer use. The living
     room, dining room, and kitchen are all in one with a long
     counter separating the kitchen.

     On the left is a wooden couch with a Mexican rug thrown
     across it and a metal chair with tan cushions for the seat
     and back. The opposite wall is all glass with the city
     lights blinking in the distance.

                                 DAPHNE
                  Mr. McGee...

     No answer.   Easy leads them to a door and opens it.

57   BEDROOM                                                             57

     Another wall of glass and

     A DEAD MAN spread out on the king-sized bed, with the
     contents of the dresser and closet strewn all over the room.

                                 DAPHNE
                  Oh, my God!

     She gags and backs out of the room with her hand over her
     mouth in case she throws up.

     Easy takes out a handkerchief and holds it over his mouth
     and nose as he gets a closer look at the body.

     It's the drunk white man he had seen at John's Speakeasy in
     the same blue suit. He's lying on his back like a crucifix
     with a butcher knife buried in his chest. There's blood
     that has drained from his chest and gathered around his face
     and hair so dark and thick you could scoop it up like Jello.

     Easy actually does throw up and doubles over, dropping to a
     knee to keep his balance and some control. He stays there
     for several moments regaining his composure and then spots a
     spilled ashtray and a cigarette butt. He lifts it off the
     floor and smells it. He wipes his mouth with the
     handkerchief and then wraps the butt inside and puts it in
     his pocket. He gets up.

                                 EASY
                  Daphne!

     He hears a CAR ENGINE start up and GEARS SHIFTING.     Then
     runs out the door.

                                                                 54.

58   EXT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       58

     A pink Studebaker whips backward out the driveway. Easy
     runs alongside trying to stop Daphne as she screeches into
     the street.

                                EASY
                   Hey, wait a minute!

     She speeds off down the canyon.

                                EASY
                   Dammit!

     He stands in the middle of the street, watching her go.

59   INT. EASY'S CAR - SUNRISE                                          59

     Fiery orange light bounces off the hood of the car into
     Easy's face as he turns the corner onto his block. He is
     surprised to see

     A WHITE CADILLAC parked in front of his house.      And now it's
     his front door that's open.

     BACK TO EASY

     He pulls in behind the Caddy and gets out.

60   INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                                  60

     He pushes open the door. Shariff loiters just inside,
     grinning at him, and Manny stands in the middle of the
     living room looking at the floor. From a RADIO in another
     room Tommy Dorsey plays "Blue Skies" with Frank Sinatra out
     front. And so Easy walks past the two hoods into

     THE KITCHEN

     Albright turns from looking out the backyard window with a
     porcelain coffee cup cradled in his right hand.

                                ALBRIGHT
                   Easy.

     Easy looks at the coffee pot on the stove and again at
     Albright, smiling loose and friendly but looking tired in
     the same clothes he had on at the pier.

                                EASY
                   What you doin' in my house, man?

                                ALBRIGHT
                   I expected you to be home, so Manny
                   used a screwdriver on the door.
                   What happened to your face?

                                                               55.

60   CONTINUED:                                                      60

                               EASY
                  You got no excuse to be breakin'
                  into my house -- What if I broke
                  into your place?

                               ALBRIGHT
                        (still smiling)
                  I'd tear your nigger head out by
                  its root.

     Easy boils inside and then goes over to the counter to pour
     himself a cup of coffee.

                               EASY
                  So what do you want?

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Where have you been this time of
                  morning, Easy?

                               EASY
                  I went to see a girl. Don't you
                  get none, Mr. Albright?

     The smile leaves Albright's face and his eyes turn even
     colder.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I didn't come here to play, boy.
                  You got my money in your pocket and
                  we've been over at that address
                  waitin' all night for Frank Green
                  and now we've found out that he
                  moved from there over a year ago.

     Easy is scared and confused but he plays it off.

                               EASY
                  So what do you want me to do about
                  it? You don't think I did my job.
                  Shit, I give you the money back.

     And he reaches for his pocket, but Albright reaches too --
     and suddenly, Manny and Shariff are in the room and on Easy
     like a vice. Albright presses the barrel of the .45 against
     Easy's forehead.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Do you believe in God, Easy?
                  'Cause I'm curious to see if death
                  is any different for a religious
                  man.

     Easy looks down, away from the gun, and swallows hard.

                                                               56.

                                EASY
                  I seen her.

     After a moment, everyone relaxes and Easy sags out from
     under their grip and staggers into

61   THE LIVING ROOM                                                 61

     Manny and Shariff surround him as he sits down in a chair
     and Albright stalks in holstering his gun.

                                ALBRIGHT
                  Where?

                               EASY
                  She called me. Had me drive up to
                  the Hollywood Hills.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  How'd she know about you?

                               EASY
                  I guess Coretta... the girl that
                  told me about Daphne and Frank
                  Green.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Why didn't you call me?

                               EASY
                  I couldn't. She threatened to tell
                  the cops that I had killed
                  Coretta...

     Albright looks over at his henchmen.

                                ALBRIGHT
                  Where is she?

                                EASY
                  She took off.

                        (dangerously)
                  Where is she?

                               EASY
                  I don't know! While I was looking
                  at the body she split.

                               ALBRIGHT
                        (nodding)
                  Uh-hunh.

                                                                57.

     Albright looks around the room as if answers lie in the
     corners, but he is not surprised to hear about a body.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  You call the cops?

                               EASY
                  I tried my best to keep in the
                  speed limit. That's all I did.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  What'd she do, take his car?

                                EASY
                  Hunh?

                                ALBRIGHT
                  McGee.   Did she take his car?

     Easy hesitates, "How did Albright know his name?"

                                EASY
                  Uh... Yeah...

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Where'd you pick her up at?

                               EASY
                  She left that place--

                               ALBRIGHT
                  --Write it down!

     To his shame Easy flinches and gets paper from his end
     table, then scribbles down the address and hands it to
     Albright who takes Easy's seat and examines the note.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Get me some whiskey, Easy.

     Easy studies Albright who sits knees wide apart, now the
     master of the house, and he can't help himself.

                               EASY
                  Get it yourself... Bottle's in the
                  cabinet.

     Albright looks up and Easy braces himself for Albright to
     bring on the end, all at once. But slowly a smile spreads
     across Albright's face and he laughs, stamping his foot.

                                                             58.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Well, I'll be damned. Get us a
                  drink, Manny... Easy, you're a
                  brave man. I need a brave man
                  working for me... But you gotta
                  find Frank Green, so he can lead us
                  to her.

                               EASY
                  No, thanks, Mr. Albright. People
                  are gettin' killed all around me...
                  You never said anything about all
                  this...

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Easy, you're connectable to two
                  murders. You'll do whatever I tell
                  you to do.

     Manny brings Albright's drink and the captain turns it up
     and gives Manny back the glass.

                                ALBRIGHT
                         (continuing)
                  Now you got three days to find him.
                  And you make sure you count 'em
                  right.

     He walks out the screen door with Manny and Shariff
     following.

62   KITCHEN                                                        62

     Easy grabs the bottle from the counter, where Manny has left
     it, and pours himself a stiff one. But he only stares into
     the glass.

     FLASHBACK:

63   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY                                         63

     Dense black smoke masks everything but two vague figures in
     a struggle. The BOOM of heavy artillery gives way only to
     the deafening CHATTER of automatic fire.

     We are hurtling forward into a horror-stricken Easy in
     combat gear, repeatedly stabbing an already lifeless German
     soldier. Tears are streaming down Easy's face, his mouth
     gaped open in an inaudible SCREAM.

64   BACK TO SCENE                                                  64

     He studies the glass and pushes it away.   Then looks

                                                               59.

65    OUT THE WINDOW                                                  65

      Albright and his two goons get in the white Caddy and cruise
      away.

66    BEDROOM                                                         66

      He dials the operator.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  I needed help... Albright didn't
                  flinch at hearing that Coretta was
                  dead and he seemed to know all
                  about Richard McGee too...

                               OPERATOR (O.S.)
                  Number please...

                               EASY
                  Raymond Alexander on...

      He pauses, speechless as

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                  Yes?

                               EASY
                        (after a moment)
                  Forget about it, operator.

      He hangs up, his eyes trained in thought.

A67   EXT. JOPPY'S BAR - DAY                                         A67

      A crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three
      convertible car caravan: the first car bearing a four-place
      band playing "Happy Days Are Here Again"; the second with
      someone who could be Lana Turner holding up a "Teran for
      Mayor" placard with a man in the front passenger seat
      announcing through a megaphone; and last, but hardly least,
      Matthew Teran blowing kisses and waving two small American
      flags.

      Easy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car
      to watch the parade. Then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the
      waistband at the small of his back, under his jacket.

      He walks with a purpose into the open door next to the
      butcher shop.

B67   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                               B67

      Easy stops in the doorway, seeing

      JOPPY as usual buffing the marble top of his bar. T-Bone
      Walker's "They Call It Stormy Monday" is on the jukebox.

                                                              60.

B67   CONTINUED:                                                    B67

      BACK TO EASY

      He scans the bar and sees that there are no customers, and
      walks in.

                                 JOPPY
                   Hey, Easy.

      Easy stops at the bar and stares at Joppy.

                                EASY
                   That girl called me last night.

                                JOPPY
                   What girl is that?

                                EASY
                   The one your friend is lookin' for.

                                 JOPPY
                   Uh, huh.   That's pretty lucky,
                   hunh?

                                EASY
                   No, Joppy... Wasn't no luck at all.
                   It was you.

      Joppy inadvertently clenches his fists and notices Easy's
      aggressive stance.

                                EASY
                   You and Coretta was the only ones
                   that had my phone number who knew I
                   was lookin' for her. And Coretta
                   was busy scammin' Daphne so she
                   wouldn't have done it... It was
                   you, man.

                                JOPPY
                   Maybe she looked in the phone book.

                                EASY
                   I ain't in the phone book, Joppy...

      Joppy's eyes narrow.

                                JOPPY
                   What the hell you mean, coming up
                   here all mad like you gonna do
                   something?!...

                                                              61.

B67   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              B67

                                EASY
                         (yelling)
                   You damn right! Coretta's dead!
                   Your friend Albright is on my ass.
                   The cops done brought me down once
                   -- Why didn't you just tell
                   Albright your damn self?

                                JOPPY
                         (yelling back)
                   What did I tell you? To just take
                   that man's money! I didn't tell
                   you to do nothin'! I call myself
                   trying to help you save your
                   house... Don't come up in here
                   startin' no shit with me.

      And he pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar, but Easy
      has pulled his hammer and SMACKS it down hard, cracking the
      beveled wood that frames the marble.

                                JOPPY
                         (continuing; panicked)
                   Easy, wait! Watch my marble! My
                   uncle left me that when he died!

                                EASY
                   And goddammit, he's about to get it
                   back.

      He draws back for the downswing, and Joppy drops the
      baseball bat, holding up his hands.

                                 JOPPY
                   Let's talk.   Let's just talk.

                                EASY
                   What you got me into, Joppy?!

      Joppy inhales, forcing himself to be calm.

                                JOPPY
                   She asked me to help her 'cause I
                   told her that Albright was lookin'
                   for her. And I figured I could
                   help you make a few bucks and throw
                   Albright off the trail too. She
                   wanted to know something about you
                   so I told her... I guess I must've
                   give her your phone number...

                                EASY
                   Where is she, man?

                                                                62.

                                JOPPY
                   I don't know...

                                EASY
                   Don't lie to me, Joppy!

                                JOPPY
                   I ain't lyin'... I don't even know
                   her that good. She just asked me
                   to help her. And she asked me not
                   to tell nobody... I guess 'cause of
                   her and Frank Green.

                                EASY
                   What's she runnin' from Joppy?

                                JOPPY
                   I swear I don't know. She didn't
                   tell me. I didn't mean to get you
                   into nothin', Easy... I just... she
                   just... I mean you seen her,
                   Easy... Man, she's something else.

      Easy can see "sucker" written all over Joppy as he fumbles
      for a cigarette with one hand and shakes his head with
      disgust as he lights up.

                                EASY
                   Damn, Joppy. Is there any white
                   woman that ever gave you the time
                   of day that you wasn't a sucker
                   for?

      Joppy frowns painfully and continues to wipe the bar.

67    EXT. T. CARTER FOUNDATION - DAY                                 67

      Easy turns into the winding driveway through the stone
      entrance way that bears the name of this distinguished
      institution on a bronze plate.

      He parks the car and gets   out, adjusting his dark brown
      Stetson which matches his   pin-stripped suit. He looks
      around at the massive and   well manicured grounds and walks
      into a patio area of this   Spanish-style complex.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   Albright had said that when you're
                   mixed up in something it's best to
                   be mixed up to the top. I could
                   see his point. So that's where I
                   was going... all the way to the
                   top.

                                                              63.

68   EXT. CARTER FOUNDATION PATIO                                   68

     An ELDERLY SECRETARY descends an outdoor curved stairway
     carrying a file. She spots Easy looking around confused and
     immediately becomes annoyed.

                              SECRETARY
                 May I help you?

                               EASY
                 Uh... yes.   I came to see Mr.
                 Carter.

                              SECRETARY
                 Do you have an appointment?

                                EASY
                 No, I don't.

                              SECRETARY
                 Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Carter is
                 a very busy man.

     Easy pulls out Albright's business card and hands it to her.

                              EASY
                 Well, tell him Mr. Albright sent
                 me, and it's real important.

     She looks at the card and then up at Easy with annoyed
     superiority.

                              SECRETARY
                 May I ask the nature of your call,
                 Mister...?

                              EASY
                 Rawlins. But I'm not so sure he'd
                 want me to tell you.

                              SECRETARY
                 I'm quite sure, Mr. Rawlins, that
                 whatever you know is nothing I
                 can't know as well.

                              EASY
                 Okay. Well, anyway, tell him I'm
                 here with information about that
                 little chippy of his that dumped
                 him.

                              SECRETARY
                 Is this some sort of joke?

                              O.S. VOICE
                 Uh... Excuse me...

                                                             64.

68   CONTINUED:                                                     68

     Easy and the secretary turn to see a TALL MAN in a dark grey
     suit with bushy black hair and thick eyebrows standing in
     the doorway. He forces a smile and comes out.

                               BAXTER
                  Mr. Rawlins was it?

     He holds out his hand and Easy shakes it.

                                EASY
                  Yes.   Mister...

                               BAXTER
                  Baxter.
                        (to the secretary)
                  I'll take care of this.
                        (and back to Easy)
                  Why don't you come with me, sir?

     They walk through the door into

69   A HALLWAY                                                      69

                               BAXTER
                  Not very smart talking about Mr.
                  Carter's business to a secretary.

                               EASY
                  I don't wanna hear it, man. It's
                  too much goin' on for me to give a
                  damn about what you think is smart.

     Baxter bristles up and slows down his walk, about to put
     Easy in his place. But Easy slows down too and squares up
     on him. Baxter reconsiders and leads the way up a stone
     staircase.

70   INT. CARTER'S OFFICE                                           70

     Baxter ushers Easy into a huge elegantly furnished room more
     closely resembling a hall than an office with large arched
     doors and windows leading out onto a stone veranda
     overlooking a canyon.

     Alone looking out at the greenery on the opposite hillside
     is TODD CARTER.

     Baxter walks out and speaks with Carter, while Easy watches
     them from inside the office. The rich man perks up with
     interest and hurries inside with Baxter who throws Easy a
     dirty look on his way out. He pauses uncertainly wearing a
     simple Sears Roebuck-looking tan suit with a plain open-
     collared white shirt. The dark circles under his eyes show
     nights without sleep.

                                                             65.

                                 CARTER
                  Mr. Rawlins.

     He runs a hand through his thinning red hair, and offers an
     overstuffed sofa. They sit on either end.

                               CARTER
                        (distraught)
                  Has something happened to Daphne?

                               EASY
                  The last time I saw her she looked
                  fine.

                                 CARTER
                  You saw her?

                                EASY
                  Yeah.   Last night.

                               CARTER
                  She's still in town?

                               EASY
                  She was last night.

                               CARTER
                  What did she say -- what was she
                  wearing?

                                 EASY
                  A blue dress.    Blue heels.

                               CARTER
                  And a pin on her chest?

                               EASY
                  Yeah, on the left side.

                                CARTER
                         (carried away)
                  Oh yes, that's her. That's her.
                  You know I've never known a woman
                  who could wear perfume so slight

                  What did she say? What did she
                  say?... Oh, I'm sorry. Brandy?

                                                             66.

     He points to a crystal decanter near Easy. Easy pours
     himself a drink and takes in Carter as he wrings his hands
     to keep from going to pieces. This guy's got it bad.

                                EASY
                  Mr. Carter. I came here to get
                  some answers.

                               CARTER
                  Yes...?

                               EASY
                  I don't know... I'm takin' a
                  helluva chance...

     Carter runs his hand through his hair again, the suspense
     killing him.

                               EASY
                        (continuing)
                  I guess it's just that when I'm
                  working for somebody, I wanna know
                  what I'm gettin' myself into...

     Carter leans in as if he missed something.

                               CARTER
                  I beg your pardon.

                               EASY
                  Well, I'd like to know the real
                  reason why Mr. Albright hired me.

                                CARTER
                        (after a moment)
                  Mr. Albright?

                              EASY
                  Yeah. The man you hired to find
                  Daphne.

                               CARTER
                  There must be some mistake... I'm
                  sorry, busy... Who are you talking
                  about?

     Easy and Carter stare at each other, not sure how to
     proceed.

                               EASY
                  You didn't hire somebody to find
                  your girlfriend?

                                                                67.

                               CARTER
                  No... Until just now I was sure
                  that she was hundreds of miles away
                  from here... You say someone is
                  looking for her?

     Easy nods, his brow furrowed in thought. Carter gets up and
     walks to the door, looking out into the canyon.

                               CARTER
                        (half to himself)
                  Someone is looking for her.

                               EASY
                  What's goin' on between you two?

     Carter shrugs and stammers nervously.

                               CARTER
                  Uh... I don't know... We were going
                  to be married... We had a fight...
                        (then recovering)
                  Uh... that's none of your concern,
                  Mr. Rawlins.

     He stops and looks to the floor, the gravity pulling him
     down... way down.

                               CARTER
                        (continuing)
                  Someone's... after her? A Mr.
                  Albright? And he said he's working
                  for me?

                               EASY
                  Yeah... Do you know a man named
                  Richard McGee?

                               CARTER
                  No... I can't say that I do.

                               EASY
                  Why would someone be after her, Mr.
                  Carter?

                  Uh... I can't say -- I don't
                  know...

     He's lying and Easy knows it.

                                                             68.

                  Do you think you could find her
                  again?

                                EASY
                  I don't know.

                               CARTER
                  It's important, Mr. Rawlins, for
                  her sake... I'm willing to pay you.

                               EASY
                  Mr. Carter, why did she leave?

                  her...

     Easy thinks about it, and then nods.

                  Okay... a thousand dollars.

                  Yeah.   I'll take two hundred right
                  now.

                               CARTER
                  Mr. Rawlins. I think you're trying
                  to take advantage of me. But left
                  me inform you that the incumbent
                  mayor and the chief of police eat
                  at my house regularly.

                                EASY
                  Good.   Then they can help us--

                                CARTER
                  --No.   They can't!

     Carter is too emphatic and Easy waits for him to give more,
     but instead he turns and gazes out again at the canyon.

                               BAXTER
                  I'll have Baxter write you out a
                  check.

                                EASY
                   I'll take cash, Mr. Carter.

      Carter fumbles in his wallet, and too nervous to count the
      money, shoves the wallet at Easy.

A72   EXT. T. CARTER FOUNDATION - DAY                               A72

      Easy walks to his car, gets in and drives away toward the
      entrance.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   So Albright was working for Matthew
                   Teran. And whatever Teran had on
                   Carter was strong stuff... too
                   strong even for Carter to go to the
                   police... But because Teran was
                   desperate to find the girl too,
                   that gave me the best hand. I had
                   seen her once, and if I played it
                   right, I'd see her again.

76   POOL HALL - THAT NIGHT                                           76

     Easy talks to the short, squat, suspicious woman who runs
     the place. Through the smoke, other distrustful eyes fix on
     him from pool tables and dark corners.

                              EASY (V.O.)
                 Everywhere I went was a familiar
                 place, but different because I was
                 asking about buying hijacked liquor
                 from the man nobody wanted to talk
                 about. Frank Green...

     Upscale, with a balcony. Billy Eckstine fronts the band.
     Blacks and whites are dressed to impress, including Easy,
     who leans into the bartender.

                              EASY (V.O.)
                 It was actually looking more and
                 more like I might not make it
                 through this little adventure I was
                 having. But I was likin' the chill
                 in my blood, and the freedom of
                 working on my own.

     liquor in a wooden crate.

                              EASY (V.O.)
                 There were times in the war when I
                 had felt like this. When life or
                 death where the only two choices.
                 That made it simple. And that was
                 alright by me.

     Easy unlatches the gate and pushes it open. He's tired, and
     he trudges up the walkway to the porch. He sees

     THE WOODCUTTER standing on the front lawn of the next door
     neighbor's, waving at him.

                                                               71.

     He throws a rock and then unlocks the door. But he notices
     THE POT OF AFRICAN VIOLETS lying broken on the cement. He
     looks up just in time to see a TWO-BY-FOUR swing down.
     BONK! And Easy is seeing stars.

     A big man, dressed in black, kicks open the door and drives
     Easy head first into

80   INT. EASY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                                 80

     Easy slams to the floor but manages to roll out of the way
     of a lethal CRACK! of the board onto the floor.

     He grabs a lamp and hurls it at the oncoming figure who
     catches it on the arm and keeps on coming, snapping a blade
     from his fist which leaps out like a chrome-colored flame.

     Easy scrambles back, his head butting up against the couch,
     his forehead streaming blood, his eyes wide with the sight
     of sure death advancing.

                  talk to you!

     Frank looms over him, his   sinister but handsome brown face
     framed by a short-rimmed,   black Stetson hat and a black
     shirt and coat. He holds    the knife to Easy's neck, letting the
     blade press into the skin   as he talks.

                               FRANK
                  You the reason why she told me to
                  lay low, hunh.

     Easy buries himself back against the sofa.

                  a white girl you know. Daphne...

     Frank's eyes flame and he presses the knife, drawing blood.

                               FRANK
                  You a dead man--

     WHAP!   WHAP!   WHAP!

                  Easy, you in there?

     Frank's head whips toward the door and Easy knocks the knife
     away and comes up tussling.

     Frank scrambles to get away and Easy tackles him, straining
     to keep Frank from reaching the knife.

     THE FRONT DOOR springs open and SPATS ON PATENT LEATHER
     SHOES clump in, the last one stomping down on Frank's
     outstretched fingers. Frank screams and cradles his hand in
     agony.

     Easy scrambles up to his knees and gawks up at

     MOUSE, dressed in a plaid zoot suit with Broadway suspenders
     down the front of his shirt, a long-barreled .41 caliber
     pistol held loosely in his hand.

                               MOUSE
                  Want me to kill him?

                               MOUSE
                  Well, what's happenin'?

     He holds out his hand and helps Easy to his feet.

     Frank makes a slight move towards the knife and Mouse levels
     the pistol at his head, his gold-rimmed teeth glittering
     from a smile that wants Frank to go for it.

                               MOUSE
                  I'll blow your goddamned nose

     Frank just stares up at Easy, his eyes sharp and defiant.

                  Look, if you don't know where she
                  is, maybe we can help each other
                  find her.

     After a moment, Mouse cocks the hammer.

                                 EASY
                  No, Mouse.    Don't kill him.

     The phone RINGS next to Mouse and he picks it up, eyes still
     on Frank.

                               MOUSE
                  Huh?... He's busy right now, you
                  gonna have to call back.

     He hangs up.

                               EASY
                  Frank, a rich man she knows is
                  willing to pay a thousand dollars
                  just to talk to her. A thousand
                  bucks, man.

     Frank still won't talk and that does it for Mouse.   He
     releases the hammer.

                               MOUSE
                  Easy, lemme try.

     THUNK!   He slaps Frank upside the head with the pistol.

                                MOUSE
                  You better...
                        (THUNK!)
                  Talk...
                        (THUNK!)
                  You stupid--

     Easy grabs Mouse's arm and Frank slumps to the floor.

                                 EASY
                  Let him go!

                               MOUSE
                  Get out of my way!

                                 EASY
                  Let him be!

     The two friends struggle, and Frank rears up and plows into
     Easy, sending him sprawling to the floor on top of Mouse.
     Then Frank, covered in blood, hurls himself across the room,
     out the door.

                                                              74.

81   Mouse gets to his feet and runs to the door aiming the       81
     pistol, but it's too late. Easy stands up and Mouse points the
     gun at him.

                              MOUSE
                 Damn you, Easy. Don't you never
                 grab me when I got a gun in my
                 hand!

     Easy silently eyes the pistol and gives Mouse a chance to
     calm down. After a moment Mouse looks down at his jacket.

                              MOUSE
                 Look at the blood you done got on
                 my coat. Why you wanna go and do
                 that?

     He looks out the door and grabs a small suitcase. Then
     spots the bathroom and moves to it, taking off his jacket
     and hanging the pistol in his belt.

     Easy holds his fingers to the bump on his forehead and
     catches his breath as Mouse runs water in the bathtub.

                              MOUSE
                 Now we got to find that girl so we
                 can get that money.

                              EASY
                 No, we don't, Mouse. I don't need
                 your kinda help or I would've
                 called you.

     Mouse comes out of the bathroom, scrubbing at a spot on his
     jacket with a washcloth.

                              MOUSE
                 You standing there with a knot on
                 your head the size of a twelve-
                 year-old tittie and you "don't need
                 my kind of help"?

                              EASY
                       (angrily)
                 This is the same shit you pulled
                 five years ago when you asked me to
                 drive you out to your stepfather's
                 house, then come to find out you
                 killed him and your stepbrother.

                              MOUSE
                 Aw, easy, that was a long time ago.

     Easy glares at Mouse and dabs blood from his forehead with a
     handkerchief.

                                                              75.

                               MOUSE
                        (after a moment)
                  Come on, Easy. Cut me in on this.
                  I could help you. I let you run
                  the show. I swear I will.

     He ambles over to Easy apologetically and holds Easy's
     shoulders with both hands.

                               MOUSE
                  I swear, I ain't gonna do nothin'
                  you don't tell me to do.

     Easy knows he can't believe this but

                               EASY
                  Everything I say?

                               MOUSE
                  Everything you say.

     With no choice, Easy nods and walks into

82   THE BATHROOM                                                   82

     He runs cold water onto a washcloth and looks in the mirror,
     dabbing at his forehead.

                               EASY
                  Who was that called?

                               MOUSE (O.S.)
                  I don't know... Sound like some
                  white girl.

     Easy turns toward the door "Aw Man!"

83   INT. EASY'S CAR - DAY                                          83

     Mouse, in a plum colored double-breasted suit and a brown
     felt derby hat, turns on the radio and the Ink Spots' "We'll
     Meet Again" purrs out. He starts to turn the key, but then
     remembers and honks the horn.

84   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                        84

     Easy opens the door and stands on the porch.

                               MOUSE
                  Hey, Easy, was it a left on
                  Richland or a right?

                                                             76.

84   CONTINUED:                                                     84

                               EASY
                  A right. And if Dupree ain't over
                  there in Compton, just come on back
                  'cause I might have heard from the
                  girl.

     Just then a car cruises around the corner and Easy watches
     MASON AND MILLER pull up across the street and get out. He
     glances over at Mouse.

85   INT. EASY'S CAR - DAY                                          85

     Mouse shuts off the radio and slumps down in the seat out of
     view.

86   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                        86

     Easy watches them stroll up the walkway.

                               MILLER
                  Mr. Rawlins... We came to ask you a
                  few more questions.

                               MASON
                        (grinning)
                  So why don't you just invite us
                  inside...
                        (holding open the door)
                  After you.

     And Easy and Miller go in.

                               MASON
                  What happened to your head? I
                  don't remember doing all that.

     He laughs and closes the door behind them.

87   INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                              87

     Miller looks around suspiciously. The room still shows
     signs of the struggle with Frank Green. He exchanges a look
     with Mason.

                               MILLER
                  Been having a party, Ezekiel?

     Mason pushes Easy into the chair and Miller plants his foot
     on the seat between Easy's legs and leans in.

                               MASON
                  You got a lotta cuts and bruises to
                  be an ordinary working stiff.

                                                             77.

                               MILLER
                  It's looking worse and worse for
                  you, my friend. What do you know
                  about Richard McGee?

                               EASY
                  Who?

     On the other side of the room Mason picks up a chunk of the
     broken lamp from the fight.

                               MILLER
                  A dead white man in a cabin in
                  Laurel Canyon.

     Mason comes over and stands over Easy next to his partner.
     He fingers the sharp porcelain shard of the lamp,
     threatening.

                               MASON
                  He hangs out with some of those
                  same nigger friends of yours down
                  on Central Avenue.

     Easy eyes the sharp edge, making up his mind to kill this
     fat son-of-a-bitch if he gets too creative, and die with
     him.

                               MILLER
                  He just happened to have a note in
                  his pocket with 'C. James' written
                  on it.

     He holds the slip of paper up for Easy to see.

                               MASON
                  Any of this making you feel
                  talkative at all, 'cause I'll bet
                  ya six bits to a bottle of piss
                  that we're looking at a double
                  here... All we need is to place you
                  in the dead man's house.

                               EASY
                  I ain't been there.

                               MILLER
                  Where?

                               EASY
                  I ain't been in no dead man's
                  house.

     Miller stands back and pats his pockets for a smoke.

                                                              78.

                  How 'bout a smoke, Ezekiel?

     Easy taps out one and Miller places it in his mouth.

                                 MILLER
                  Got a light?

     Easy pulls out his lighter and sparks the flame.

                                 MILLER
                  May I?

     Easy shrugs and passes the lighter to Miller who fires
     himself up.

                               MILLER
                  Nice lighter...

     He holds the lighter out of Mason who wraps it up in a
     handkerchief.

                               MILLER
                  And we got our print.

      Mouse right behind.

                                 MOUSE
                   Yeah.

      And he hurries around to the driver's side.

                                EASY
                   Before we run out to Compton we got
                   one other place to stop by...

      He freezes seeing the Woodcutter watching and listening.

                   Man, don't you mess with my trees
                   while I'm gone.

      He gets in as Mouse cranks the engine.

                                 EASY
                   You heard me.   Leave my trees
                   alone.

      As Mouse starts away the old man smiles mischievously and
      starts to sharpen his axe.

      Easy leans out the car window, yelling back as the car pulls
      away.

                                EASY
                   I mean it now. Don't you mess with

92    EXT. PORTLAND COURT - DAY                                        92

      It's a horseshoe of tiny apartments with over a dozen little
      porches and doorways staggered in a semi-circle around a
      small yard that has a half-dozen stunted magnolia trees
      growing in brick pots.

      Easy and Mouse step into the courtyard, passing elderly
      tenants sitting inside screened doors. Jimmy Lunceford's
      "I'm Walking Through Heaven With You" floats out into the
      yard.

      They arrive at the closed door of number eight. Easy knocks
      and then knocks again, hard. Something CRASHES on the
      inside and heavy FOOTSTEPS pound to the door.

                                 VOICE BEHIND DOOR
                   Who's that?

     The door opens and JUNIOR FORNAY stands there behind the
     screen door in blue boxer shorts and a white T-shirt.

                               JUNIOR
                  What you want?

                               EASY
                  It's private, Junior.   Lemme in.

     And he reaches to pull open the door, but Junior throws the
     latch.

                               JUNIOR
                  I ain't got time now.   I'm tryin'
                  to get some sleep.

                  Why don't you open the door,
                  Junior, 'fore I have to shoot it
                  down.

     Mouse steps out into the doorway, in plain view.

                                JUNIOR
                  Mouse.

                                MOUSE
                  Open up.   We ain't got all night.

     Junior forces a smile and lets them in.

93   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT - DAY                                    93

     Filthy and junky, with old car parts scattered amongst old
     furniture, the room is unpleasant with only the benefit of a
     dim light -- just like Junior.

                               JUNIOR
                  Y'all want a beer?

     He nods at a card table with one folding chair and throws
     two others into place on his way to the refrigerator.

     Easy and Mouse sit down and Junior brings over a quart of
     PABST BLUE RIBBON BEER and two glasses that he wipes out
     with a rag.

                               EASY

     Junior tosses his pack onto the table and pours beer into
     the glasses for Easy and Mouse, and drinks from the bottle.

     Easy unfolds the handkerchief in his pocket on the table,
     uncovering the cigarette butt from Richard McGee's house.

                               EASY
                        (to Junior)
                  This is one of yours, ain't it?

     Junior looks at the butt and shrugs.

                               EASY
                  You the only one I know cheap
                  enough to smoke this shit... Why'd

                               JUNIOR
                  You crazy, man. You crazy!

     And he stands up to emphasize his indignation.

                               MOUSE
                  Sit down, Junior.

     Junior shifts awkwardly from side to side and then sits back
     down.

                               EASY
                  Tell me what happened, Junior.

                               JUNIOR
                  I don't know what you talkin'
                  'bout.

                  the same suit on and a knife in his
                  chest.

                  You thick-headed, ya damn self!!

     But Mouse is up, still laughing with the pistol in his hand.

                  Sit down, man... 'fore I blow your

                  Sit down.

     Junior sits down and throws himself around in the chair like
     a child throwing a fit.

                               EASY
                  You better tell it the way it
                  happened. And maybe I'll forget
                  what I know... Otherwise, I'm gonna

                  know I don't like your ass and he
                  don't like you either.

     Mouse slaps the table, laughing so hard he's in tears.

                               MOUSE
                  Aw, man...

     And he aims the pistol and cocks the hammer, causing Junior
     to throw himself around some more.

                                                               85.

      little country-styled houses set back away from the road
      behind vegetable gardens and chicken coops and small sheds
      with a horse or a cow tied up.

     Easy and Mouse pull into    the gravel driveway of a little
     house and are met by the    usual barking dog you find in the

98   INT. DUPREE'S SISTER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK                    98

     Dupree's face under the kitchen light shows two swollen
     black eyes from a brutal police "questioning." His eyes are
     heavy with liquor and tears glisten down his cheeks.

                               DUPREE
                  Why somebody wanna kill her like
                  that? Why?

                               EASY
                  I don't know, Dupree... I don't
                  know...

                                                                88.

     Dupree pours rye whiskey into a water glass in front of
     Mouse, who swallows half the shot without looking up from
     his plate of food.

     Easy declines when the bottle comes his way, feeling the
     pressure of time running out.

                               EASY
                  Did Coretta ever say anything to
                  you about a letter she was keeping?

                                DUPREE
                  Letter?   What kinda letter?

                               EASY
                  For that white girl...

                               DUPREE
                  Naw. But I know it was on account
                  of her that Coretta got killed.

     Easy rears back in his chair with keen interest and Mouse
     looks up from his pigtails.

     Dupree takes a drink and his eyes narrow in anger.

                               DUPREE
                        (continuing)
                  Everything between Coretta and that
                  Daphne was always such a damn
                  secret... I mean that ole girl
                  didn't think nothin' about two-
                  timin' on Frank... She probably
                  'innerduced' Coretta to one of them
                  ole guys she knew... And when he
                  came to the house after Coretta...
                        (starting to break)
                  ...he found out she wasn't that
                  kinda woman... Cops said she fought
                  him... aw my Gawd... fought him
                  'cause she wouldn't have nobody but
                  me-e-e...

     He buries his face into his hands and Easy throws a sad but
     frustrated look to Mouse.

                               DUPREE
                        (continuing)
                  Aw Gawd, I can't even go to
                  sleep... 'cause I can still see her
                  face that mornin' 'fore I went to
                  work...
                               (MORE)

                                                                89.

                                DUPREE (CONT'D)
                   Junior had been by and just left
                   the house... and she came runnin'
                   out to the car carrying her
                   bible... And she said, 'Keep this
                   for me, baby.'

      Easy and Mouse exchange looks.   JACKPOT!   And Dupree falls
      apart.

                                DUPREE
                         (continuing)
                   Police won't even let me go near
                   her house. So it's the only thing
                   I got left from her. It was a
                   sign... I know it was a sign,
                   'cause she was so religious...

                                MOUSE
                   It's all right, big man... it's all
                   right...

      And he pours Dupree a half glass of rye.

99    THE BOTTLE - LATER, NIGHT                                        99

      Barely a "corner" of whiskey lies at the bottom and

      DUPREE is snoring like a buzzsaw, sound asleep.

      MOUSE squints into his glass, wondering why it's empty, and
      looks down the length of the kitchen leading into

100   THE BEDROOM - NIGHT                                             100

      Drawers are pulled out on the dresser, and Easy is rifling
      through another until he pulls out a bible. He fans the
      pages, finding

      THE LETTER

      already opened.    His fingers pull out a photograph and then
      two more.

      BACK TO EASY

      His excited face goes sick, and he silently mouths:

                                EASY
                   Holy shi-it...

                                                                 90.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I was as nauseated from fear as I
                   was from what I saw... Pictures of
                   a much younger Matthew Teran and
                   children... innocent, helpless,
                   naked children...

101   KITCHEN                                                          101

      Easy hurries in holding up the letter.

                                EASY
                   I got it. Come on, I think that
                   girl is gonna call again.

                                MOUSE
                   That Dupree is a good man, but he
                   sure can't hold his liquor.

      Easy grabs his coat off a chair and starts to put it on,
      stuffing the letter in his coat pocket.

                                 EASY
                   You got your sails up pretty far
                   too, Raymond.

                                MOUSE
                   You callin' me drunk?

                                EASY
                   Well, you been puttin' it away
                   along with him and--

                                MOUSE
                   If I was drunk could I do this?

      And in less than a heartbeat he has pulled that long-
      barreled pistol and is aiming it at Easy's forehead.

                                MOUSE
                   Ain't a man in Texas can outdraw

                         (forced calm)
                   Put it down.

                                MOUSE
                   Go on.

      And he puts the gun back in his shoulder holster.

                                                              91.

                                MOUSE
                   Go for your gun. Let's see who
                   gets kilt.

                                 EASY
                   I don't have a gun, Raymond.   Come
                   on, let's go.

                                MOUSE
                   You fool enough to go without a
                   piece then you must wanna be dead.

      He lays the pistol on the table then draws a .32 automatic
      from his waist, this time cocking the hammer, the muzzle
      only inches from Easy's head.

      Easy can tell from the glazed look in Mouse's eye that
      instead of seeing him, his friend is glaring at some demon
      he carries around in his head. So he stands stock still.

                                EASY
                         (quiet, soothing)
                   Let him go, Raymond... He done
                   learned his lesson. If you kill
                   him then he won't have got it.

                                MOUSE
                   He fool enough to call me out and
                   he ain't even got no gun? I'll
                   kill the motherfucker.

                                EASY
                   Let him live, Raymond, and he be
                   scared whenever you walk in the
                   room.

                                MOUSE
                   Motherfucker better be scared. I
                   kill a motherfucker. I kill him!

      Easy stares down the barrel of the gun for a long moment
      until Mouse blinks, then nods and lets the pistol fall down
      into his lap. His head on his chest, he's sound asleep.

      Easy takes the gun and puts it on the table with the other.
      Then walks to the doorway and turns out the light.

102   INT. EASY'S CAR - NIGHT                                       102

      The dim street lamps of Easy's neighborhood streak past as
      Easy scans the streets and sidewalks, wary for anybody who
      might be staking him out.

                                                              91.

                   The pictures were burnin' a hole in
                   my pocket... I had no doubt that
                   Albright had killed McGee... and
                   that he had done it for Matthew
                   Teran... But Teran hadn't known who
                   killed Coretta. I was sure of
                   that, too.

103   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      103

      Easy's car pulls up and he gets out and looks around
      cautiously before starting up the walkway.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                         (continuing)
                   For the first time I hated walking
                   up to my house... I still didn't
                   know if I could go to the police.
                   But Albright was liable to be
                   showing up in a few hours asking
                   about Frank Green. I was thinking
                   I oughta forget the girl and leave
                   town, back to Houston or Galveston
                   where they didn't know me too good.

      Easy gets to the door, still literally looking over his
      shoulder, and hears the phone RINGING inside. He unlocks
      the door and bursts in.

104   INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                              104

105   INT. BEDROOM                                                   105

      And picks up the phone but the dial tone DRONES on the other
      end.

                   Shit!   Damn!

      He whacks the nightstand with the receiver, dying with
      frustration. And SOMETHING MOVES in the dark. He lunges
      and grabs

      DAPHNE MONET

      and pulls her into the light, then sits down onto the bed
      before the shock can knock him down.

                                DAPHNE
                   Are you all right?

      Easy shakes his head in disbelieving relief and she reaches
      to touch the bump on his forehead.

                                DAPHNE
                   What happened?

      Easy shakes his head, amused, and lights a cigarette.

                   --I already have the pictures...

      Daphne stiffens, as if from an electrical shock, and then:

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, I paid seven thousand dollars

                   doesn't wanna be mayor no more...
                   You leave, he's worried but he
                   can't even get his buddies in the
                   police department to help him find
                   you... And now you wanna buy some
                   pictures of Teran. Why? 'Cause
                   he's got some dirt on you.

      She gets up and walks away.

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, why don't you just take the
                   money!

                                EASY
                   Is that what Frank told Coretta?

      She whirls around to face him.

                                EASY
                         (continuing)
                   Was she being too nosy? Or was she
                   just being Coretta and trying to
                   bargain up the price?

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, please.  How much do you
                   want?

                                                             95.

                               EASY
                   Tell me. Is Frank your husband or
                   your pimp?

      SMACK! She swings and open hand across his face, and SMACK!
      He returns the gesture, sending her back onto the bed...

      He picks up the phone and dials "O."

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, put the phone down.

                                EASY
                   Why don't you try screaming again?
                   'Cause I bet police like white
                   women with Negro boyfriends who
                   hijack trucks...

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, please.

      She reaches for the phone and he pushes her away.

                                EASY
                   I bet they like pimps, and whores,
                   too, who scam rich white men like
                   Carter runnin' for mayor.

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, please, put it down...

                                EASY
                   And I'm sure they like it when
                   these white girls tell their
                   colored men to lay low 'cause they
                   killed a woman over some pictures
                   of another rich white man.

      She gathers herself, just as:

                   Frank is my brother.

      Easy is about to speak, but then stands still.

                   Number please?

      He hangs up.

      She looks away, worn out, tired.

                                DAPHNE
                   We have different fathers. Mine is
                   white... Frank doesn't even know
                   that Todd and I broke up. So far
                   I've kept him out of all this.

      She gets up and takes Easy's cigarettes and taps one out.

                                DAPHNE
                   See, Coretta's the only one out
                   here in L.A. besides my brother who
                   knew about me...
                         (she lights up)
                   And about a month ago she took a
                   job working for, of all people,
                   Matthew Teran. She made friends
                   with one of the girls in the office
                   who told her that she'd heard that
                   Teran was a pedophile. And Coretta
                   got carried away and told her that
                   Todd Carter was engaged to a
                   colored woman. She was sorry and
                   didn't think it would get to
                   Teran... but it did and he got a
                   hold of my birth records.

                                EASY
                   Who killed her, Daphne?

      Daphne exhales smoke and brushes hair out of her face
      ignoring the question.

                                DAPHNE
                         (continuing)
                   Todd and I broke up and I paid a
                   guy for the pictures of Teran. But
                   somehow Coretta got them.

                                EASY
                   Who killed her?

                                 DAPHNE
                   It was an accident. Coretta and I
                   were still mad at each other. I
                   mean, she threatened to sell Teran
                   the pictures.

                                EASY
                   Who killed her goddammit!?

                                                              97.

                   I just asked Joppy to go over and
                   put a scare in her... It was an
                   accident.

      FLASHBACK:

106   INT. KITCHEN - CORETTA'S HOUSE                                 106

      Joppy points a finger in Coretta's face, backing her against
      the counter. She grabs a knife from a rack of dishes left
      out to dry.

                                DAPHNE (V.O.)
                   Joppy said she pulled a knife and
                   tried to dump hot water on him...

      She swipes at Joppy and he backhands her against the
      stove... She struggles to grab a pot of boiling water, but
      he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against
      the counter, her head striking the tile on the way down.

107   BACK TO SCENE                                                  107

      Daphne looks down at her hands.

      She stubs out her cigarette and sits on the bed.

                                DAPHNE
                   God, I didn't mean to hurt
                   anybody... It's just that with the
                   pictures I can--

                               EASY
                   What? Marry Carter?   Be white
                   again?

                                DAPHNE
                   Don't judge me, Easy! Do you think
                   I like pretending that I'm someone
                   else? Do you know how I've been
                   treated by people, colored and
                   white, when I've tried to live as a
                   colored woman in a colored
                   community. Do you have any idea
                   what any colored man whose ever
                   been with me has had to go through?
                   Don't you dare judge me!

      She sees Easy hesitate and she stands up.

                                DAPHNE
                         (continuing)
                   Come on, Easy. Help me.

                                                              98.

      She moves in close, caressing.

                                DAPHNE
                         (continuing)
                   Come on, you know it's the right
                   thing to do... You know if things
                   were different what would happen
                   between us.

                                EASY
                   I'll tell you what can happen
                   between us. You get Carter to
                   clear me up from all this and you
                   can have your pictures. That's all
                   that could have ever happened
                   between us.

                                 DAPHNE
                         (genuinely hurt)
                   Sure, baby. Of course,
                   sweetheart...

      The sound of the front door pushing open startles them, and
      Albright knocks on his way in.

                                ALBRIGHT
                   Well I'll be damned. You found
                   her.

      And Manny and Shariff step in, too, carrying baseball bats.

                                EASY
                   Wait a minute, Albright.

      Daphne breaks for the back way and Easy tries to bar Shariff
      from going after her.

                                EASY
                   Hey!

      Manny swings the baseball bat into Easy's side. and Easy
      yells and plows into him, wrestling him against the wall.

      Albright grabs Easy from behind and pries him free enough
      for Manny to uppercut him to the chin with the fat end of
      the bat.

      Easy sinks to his knees seeing double.

      Shariff leads Daphne back into the room, her face contorted
      into tears, her arm twisted up behind her in a hammerlock.

                                                              99.

                   Where are the pictures?

                         (terrified)
                   I don't know.

      SMACK!   He backhands her.

      Easy grabs for the wall to get to his feet and Manny swings
      the bat down into his kidney.

                                ALBRIGHT
                   Where are they?

                   I wouldn't tell him! And I won't
                   tell you!

                                ALBRIGHT
                   Sure you will.
                         (to Shariff)
                   Let's go.

      Shariff leads Daphne outside and Manny draws his forty-five
      automatic and trains it on Easy, cocking the hammer.

                                ALBRIGHT
                   What're you doin'? Who are we
                   gonna give 'em to cover this shit,
                   hunh?... Use your head.

      He shoves Manny through the door and pushes Easy onto his
      side with his foot and he's out the door.

      Easy strains to get back to his knees as car doors slam and
      the sound of a car engine growls to life.

      He thrusts himself up from the floor and stumbles toward the
      front door like a boxer who should have stayed down for the
      count. He gets it open in time to see...

108   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      108

      The blurred white form of Albright's Caddy screaming away,
      shattering the dark, shrieking in flight.

      Dogs are barking and a baby is screaming somewhere in the
      neighborhood while lights are going on up and down the
      block.

      Easy stumbles back inside and into

                                                                 100.

      out of the room.

      Easy is ripping through the night, the streetlights flashing
      by in blurs of light. The windows down, he's coming to.

                                 EASY (V.O.)
                    It had come to me in less time than
                    it takes to think that Albright was
                    taking Daphne someplace more
                    isolated than that office building
                    downtown... Someplace where there
                    would be no witnesses... And I was
                    being left alive to take the fall.

111   EXT. BUTCHER SHOP/JOPPY'S BAR - NIGHT                             111

      The street is still alive. A couple of late night juke
      joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party
      onto the sidewalk to straggle home. Easy's car screams
      around the corner, and then skids in, sending a heavy-hipped
      young sister, about to cross the street, scrambling for
      cover.

      He jumps out just as Mouse scorches the tires on Dupree's
      '38 Packard in behind him.

      It takes a moment to register, but when she sees him pull
      a twenty from his pocket, she gets busy.

      He runs back to Mouse.

      Mouse smiles, loving this side of Easy, and trades him a set
      of car keys for a .32 automatic.

                                EASY
                         (continuing)
                   Start up my car. I'm comin' out
                   fast.

      He runs back to the woman he almost hit and hands off the
      twenty, grabbing one of the nylons, leaving her still
      stripping as he runs into

112   INT. STAIRWAY                                                  112

      He takes the steps two at a time, pulling the stocking down
      over his face as he reaches the top and bursts through the
      open door leading into

113   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                               113

      He charges through the raucous laughter of the half-full
      room right up to the bar.

      Joppy nearly drops the glasses he is clearing away as he
      looks down the barrel of the pistol aimed at his face.

                                EASY
                   Come on, Joppy. Let's go!

      Joppy hesitates, recognizing the voice.

                                EASY
                   You heard me.  I'll blow your head
                   off!

      And he cocks the hammer, causing Joppy to get a move on from
      behind the bar.

      Easy shoves him through the door, calling back to the
      startled crowd on his way out.

                                                              102.

       And he's gone.

114    INT. JOPPY'S BAR - NIGHT                                       114

       Easy hides the piece in his coat pocket as he bum rushes
       Joppy to the car.

       And he shoves Joppy into the back seat, getting in next to
       him.

                                 EASY
                    Drive this damn thing, Mouse!

       Mouse pulls off, around the corner, down the street into an
       alley.

                    Son-of-a-bitch!

       And he pulls out his pistol, aiming it back over the seat at
       Joppy as he drives. KABLAAM! The bullet slams through the
       rear window just to the side of Joppy's head.

                                  EASY
                    Mouse!   What're you doin'?

       KABLAAM! This one digs out a chunk of upholstery between

                                  EASY
                    Hey!   Watch out!

       The car screeches to a halt and Mouse tries to aim again.
       But Easy struggles with Mouse's gun hand still holding a
       pistol on Joppy.

                                 EASY
                    Mouse, we need him to lead the way!

       KABLAAM!   This one rips through the roof.

       Joppy's yelling, afraid that Easy's gun will go off.

      The engine roars from a punch to the accelerator, and
      Mouse's voice can be heard cutting through the darkness as
      the car powers off down the street.

                                MOUSE (O.S.)

      in the headlight beams.

                  Easy, come on, man. That girl is
                  lying if she told you I killed them

      SCREAM! It's muted and distant.     But it's a woman all
      right. SCREAM!

      Easy pushes out of the back door on the right as Mouse opens
      the opposite door on the driver's side.

123   EXT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT                                   123

      The cabin draws nearer as Easy scrambles up the hill. He
      can hear Daphne crying out something, but he can't make out
      the words.

      It quiets down as he nears and sees shadows crossing a
      window with the shade pulled down.

      He moves cautiously, quietly to the window and peers through
      the crack between the shade and the windowsill. He can make
      out a sliver of what looks like a large room with a low
      ceiling. SMACK! And Daphne screams again.

                                ALBRIGHT'S VOICE
                   Come on, talk to me. Talk to me
                   while you still can.

                   Please! I don't have them!     Easy
                   has them!

      Easy can barely make out Shariff passing the window.   He
      strains to see more.

                                ALBRIGHT'S VOICE
                   You said he didn't know anything.

                   Okay. Grab that for me, Shariff.
                   It's ready.

      And then SCRE-E-EAM!! The kind that drops the bottom out of
      your stomach. The kind more akin to fear than the word
      itself... The kind that fries your skin with the cold chill
      of horror. S-C-R-E-EAMS again!!

                                 DAPHNE'S VOICE

                   No-o-o!

124   Easy's gotta make a move. KABLANGALANGLE! He smashes the           124
      window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up.

      Manny looks right up at his face as Daphne arches and
      flails, trying to get free from his hands that are pinning
      her down on a battered old sofa.

      Albright is holding a glowing red poker that Shariff,
      standing in front of the fireplace, has just handed him.

      Easy starts blasting.   KABLAAM!   Manny takes one to the
      throat. KABLAAM!

      Albright and Shariff lunge for cover, and Daphne ducks down
      behind the back of the sofa, screaming and screaming.

      Manny, hand to his throat, pulls his gun on reflex, firing
      into the floor and then half runs, half staggers out the
      side door just ahead of another KABLAAM! that digs out a
      chunk of the wall.

      Easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down, getting
      ready for Manny who should be coming his way from the side
      door. He HEARS more steps stumble out and then... SILENCE.

      And then, KABLAAM! BLAAM! Two huge blasts rip right
      through the wall next to Easy's head, and he scrambles to
      the side of the house, underneath another window with the
      shade pulled down.

                                ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                         (to Shariff)

                                 SHARIFF
                         (getting frantic)
                   I don't know!

                                ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                   That you, Easy?
                         (SILENCE)
                   Tell us what you want, buddy.   See
                   what we can work out.

      Easy HEARS footsteps coming alongside the house where he had
      been moments ago. KABLAAM! BLAAM! Albright has fired from
      the inside again, thinking it's him.

                                EASY
                         (whispering)

      But it's Manny, clutching his throat, gurgling for air,
      stumbling aimlessly off down the hill. A walking dead
      man... EASY hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a
      moment the gurgling stops.

                                ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                   Easy... Hey, Buddy
                         (then to Shariff)
                   Come on, goddammit!

      Daphne cries out and KLABLANGLE! Easy breaks the window
      with the gun but KABLAAM! BLAAM! BLAAM! The windowsill
      tears out above his head and Daphne screams again.

      Easy looks up to see Shariff, holding her in front of him as
      a shield. He's headed straight for Easy, drawing a bead on
      him for the kill. And then KABLAAM! the back of Shariff's
      skull flies off and

      MOUSE is in the side door, blasting.     BLAAM!

      Albright breaks for the window. BLAAM! The slug spins him
      halfway around but he hurls himself through the window
      backwards.

      Easy scurries to the front of the house and BLAAM! The
      bullet goes wide and Albright manages to get into his car
      and returns fire. BLAAM! BLAAM!... Easy hits the deck.

      Albright's engine roars to life and he SQUEALS out on the
      gravel. Mouse appears on the other side of the house and
      CLICK! CLICK! he's out of ammo. He pulls out the other
      pistol, but it's too late.

                                MOUSE
                   Damn, damn, damn! I hit him!     I
                   hit him!

      Easy gets up from the ground and trudges into the front
      door.

125   INT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN                                            125

      Easy finds Daphne standing in the middle of the room, her
      whole body quaking in shock. He takes off his jacket and
      drapes it around her.

                                EASY
                   Come on... You all right?

      Her top lip is swollen and bloody and she has a dark bruise
      on her cheek... She jerks her head, nodding "yes."

                                                             109.

      As he leads her through the doorway, he stops to look back
      at Shariff's legs sprawling out on the floor from behind the
      sofa.

126   EXT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT                                  126

      He leads her down the front porch and hears.

                                MOUSE
                   There's blood all over here... I
                   got him.

      Mouse gets up from squatting down, grinning, the gold rims
      of his teeth catching a glint from the light coming through
      the door. He looks Daphne over, admiring.

                                 MOUSE
                   Damn.   Sweetheart.

      Easy leads her past, quickly.

                                 MOUSE
                   She okay?

                                 EASY
                   Yeah.   Let's go.

127   EXT. ROUTE 9 - NIGHT                                           127

      Mouse opens the back seat door of the car and Easy sees that
      there's no one there.

                                EASY
                   Where's Joppy?

      And then he looks around quickly, seeing

      JOPPY'S BODY lying off on the side of the road.

                                EASY
                   What happened?

      Mouse shrugs.

                                MOUSE
                   I didn't have time to be tying him
                   up.

      Daphne sees the body too and starts gagging. Easy's face
      twists into helpless pain and he holds a handkerchief to
      Daphne's mouth.

                                 EASY
                   Why, man?   Why?

                                                                 110.

                                 MOUSE
                    Why what? You just said don't
                    shoot him. And I didn't... I
                    choked his ass...

       Easy helps Daphne into the car and closes the door.

                                  EASY
                    Damn Mouse!   Why?

                                 MOUSE
                    How I'm gonna help you back there
                    foolin' 'round with him?

                                 EASY
                    He was tied up! Why?!

                                 MOUSE
                    Aw, man. If you didn't want him
                    kilt you shouldn't have left him
                    with me.

       And he goes around to the passenger side of the car to get
       in.

       Unlike up at the house this was murder -- the same as it had
       been in Texas with Mouse's stepfather and brother. Tears of
       rage well up in Easy's eyes as he hears the car door close.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

A128   EXT. GLENDALE TRAIN STATION - NIGHT                              A128

       Daphne sits in the car, her eyes staring straight ahead,
       still in shock.

128    EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                             128

       A few people hurry to board the train, Easy and Mouse among
       them.

                                 EASY (V.O.)
                    I convinced Mouse to take the two
                    o'clock train to Pomona and to let
                    me handle everything else. He
                    could get a train back to Houston
                    later that morning... He was fine
                    with that but only because he was
                    seven thousand dollars richer.
                    Daphne had gotten the money out of
                    a locker at the YMCA without a
                    word...
                                 (MORE)

                                                                111.

128   CONTINUED:                                                       128

                                EASY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Because she was still in shock and
                   couldn't really talk... Maybe too
                   because she had stolen about four
                   times that much from Carter.

                                MOUSE
                   Listen, if you think you gonna have
                   trouble with that dude Frank, I can
                   run by and kill him and take that
                   evening train to Houston.

                                 EASY
                   Naw, man.

      He has had enough of Mouse for a while.

                                 MOUSE
                   Oh.   This is for you.

      And he pulls out something wrapped up in a brown paper bag
      from his coat.

                                MOUSE
                   I cut you in for half 'cause I knew
                   you was too big a fool to take your
                   share from that white girl
                   yourself.

      Easy stares numbly at the package and then takes it.

      The conductor gets on board and the train starts making
      those metal on metal sounds.

                                MOUSE
                   Send my grip to Etta Mae. I'm
                   gonna see if she'll take me back
                   now that I'm flush.

      He slaps Easy on the shoulder and boards the train.

                                MOUSE
                   Oh, here's the keys to Dupree's
                   car.

      He tosses them, and the train starts moving.

                                MOUSE
                   And if you need somebody to run
                   them streets with ya, gimme a call.
                   You know how to put some money in a
                   nigga's pocket.

      And he laughs, flashing gold teeth pulling away.

                                                             112.

      Easy watches.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I knew I would see him again and I
                   didn't know how I felt about
                   that... 'cause, unlike Mouse, my
                   legs were like rubber... the way
                   they had been in the war the whole
                   two years I was there.

129   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - NIGHT                         129

      Easy sits in his car smoking a cigarette, rubbing his aching
      chin, looking out at

      DAPHNE AND CARTER

      standing on the lawn in front of the planetarium. Carter
      wanders after Daphne, explaining while she paces back and
      forth in anger.

                                EASY
                   I could tell how it was gonna go
                   when Carter asked us to meet him at
                   the Observatory instead of at his
                   house... She knew it, too. But she
                   had come this far and she had to
                   play it out.

      Suddenly, Daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back
      toward the car. Carter follows behind.

                                 CARTER
                   Daphne!   Daphne, sweetheart!

      He starts over, too, but then stops, knowing here's no use.

130   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                               130

      She gets in.

                                DAPHNE
                   Come on, Easy. Let's go.

      Easy throws a look over at Carter.

                                DAPHNE
                         (continuing)
                   Don't worry, you can give him the
                   pictures yourself.

      And she throws them down on the seat.

                                                             113.

132   Easy fires up the engine and pulls away with Daphne            132
      looking straight ahead.

                               EASY
                  Hey, I'm sorry.

      The slight twist of her head amounts to a shrug and then the
      tears flow. The sun is coming up over the city below...

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  For the first time I felt that I
                  could fall in love with her, too...
                  I was even wondering if it was
                  starting to happen when I dropped
                  her off at 63rd and Dinker where
                  her brother, Frank, was waiting...
                  Then it occurred to me that she
                  still had Carter's money... and I
                  felt like a fool.

133   INT. CITY HALL                                                 133

      Easy walks onto the rotunda holding a hand to his aching
      kidney. A secretary comes out to meet him and as she
      leaves, Todd Carter and a group of men in business suits
      converge on him, shaking hands.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  Evidently Carter had told all his
                  cronies about the pictures because
                  they were all smiles and handshakes
                  and "how do ya do"... The Mayor,
                  the police chief... The newspaper;
                  land developers. All the men who
                  ran the City, and who really stood
                  to gain by who was the Mayor for
                  the next six years.

      The group fans out leaving Carter and Easy alone to walk off
      down a hallway.

134   OMIT                                                           134

      Spacious and heavy in leather and wood with a not-so-
      spectacular view of the mountains. It's cold and official
      like the job itself.

      Carter pulls a brown envelope from inside his coat pocket,
      not unlike Albright.

                                                             114.

136   CONTINUED:                                                    136

                                CARTER
                   Here's the remaining eight hundred
                   that I owe you... in cash... And
                   another thousand which I hope will
                   keep this whole thing... you know.

      Easy nods a tentative "sure."

                                CARTER
                         (continuing)
                   And I've taken care of your
                   problems with the police. You'll
                   have no more trouble there. And
                   that's a promise.

      Easy nods and starts to go, but...

                                CARTER
                         (continuing; to Easy)
                   Mr. Rawlins... did Daphne ever
                   say... she loved me?

      Easy shrugs, not knowing how to answer.

                                EASY
                   Would it really matter if she did,
                   Mr. Carter?

      Carter nods sadly and Easy walks away leaving him a lonely
      figure amidst all his power.

137   EXT. CITY HALL - DAY                                          137

      Easy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the
      granite steps.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I'd been thinking about Daphne,
                   too... wondering if she meant what
                   she said about what could have
                   happened between us... But at the
                   moment I was wondering if there was
                   any such thing as a sprained chin.
                   But other than that and a headache,
                   a loose tooth and a kidney that a
                   doctor would need to look at, I
                   felt like five thousand, three
                   hundred dollars... And unless
                   Albright was alive somewhere, that
                   feelin' was gonna last a while.

                                O.S. VOICE

      Miller and Mason are waiting outside their car at the curb.
      They come over.

                                MILLER
                   You got some mighty powerful
                   friends up there... mighty
                   powerful. But, see, we got a
                   problem.

      Easy listens disinterestedly.

                                MILLER
                         (continuing)
                   With the Chief sealing these things
                   up like this, it doesn't do much
                   for the morale of the men who've
                   been working on these cases.

                                 MASON
                   Yeah.   Makes 'em feel like shit.

                                MILLER
                   There's a guy who's been callin' on
                   the phone. And we're pretty sure
                   that he was up there with McGee.

                   A... uh... colored guy... sounds
                   kinda dumb...

                                MILLER
                         (correcting)
                   Not very bright... But he said you
                   accused him of the murder. And he
                   swears you were up there, too...

                                MASON
                   In fact, he's out and out pointing
                   the finger at ya.

                                MILLER
                   How about a name?

                                MASON
                   He'd do it to you...

      Easy waits to make sure they're finished, and...

                   Sorry, fellas. But I gotta go.

                   spit on the fucking sidewalk... I
                   better not even--

      Mason's voice fades under.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   It might be the last moment of my
                   adult life spent free was walking
                   away from City Hall.

138   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                       138

      A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE reads: "Carter Back In Race."

      The subheading reads: "Quiet Civic Leader Returns As
      Flamboyant Teran Quits."

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   The paper treated the mysterious
                   flip-flop like it happened every
                   day. And I could tell that Matthew
                   Teran wouldn't spend a day in
                   jail... Back in the second section
                   of the paper was a small article
                   about an unidentified man found
                   dead, slumped over the steering
                   wheel of a white Cadillac just
                   north of Malibu...

      FURTHER BACK, we see that Odell is reading the newspaper,
      nursing a can of ale.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   It scared me to think about a world
                   that could kill a man like DeWitt
                   Albright... What could a world like
                   that do to me?

                                ODELL
                   Hey, Easy, where's your car?

      Easy looks up from pulling weeds.

                   I'm gonna go to work for myself.
                   Take a little money I got saved up
                   and go into real estate... Start
                   fixin' up folks' gardens again...
                   and do a few favors on the side...
                   Favors for friends.

                                EASY
                   Well, like a woman offered me
                   thirty dollars to go track down her
                   husband for her.

                                ODELL

                   investigatin' or somethin'... You
                   could get in trouble doin' that.

      Easy keeps working.

                                EASY
                   Like a man once said to me, Odell:
                   'Walk out your door in the morning
                   and you're already in trouble'...
                   It's just how you're mixed up in
                   that trouble that counts.

                                EASY
                   If you got a friend that does bad
                   and you still keep him as your
                   friend, even though you know what
                   he's like... Do you think that's
                   right?

                                ODELL
                   All you got is your friends,
                   Easy...

      Easy starts to nod, but then spots

      THE WOODCUTTER

      hovering over a rosebush in a neighbor's yard across the
      street, his shears ready to cut.

                                EASY
                         (calling out)
                   Get out of that yard!
                         (to Odell)
                   Bastard cut down two of my trees.

      Easy picks up a rock and sails it. Odell comes off the
      porch and does the same. Then a neighbor from across the
      street joins in.

      THE WOODCUTTER ambles off toward another block, leaving
      Easy, Odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the
      street.

139   UP THE BLOCK                                                   139

      a man with a pony is setting up a camera. A few children
      have gathered, and more are running over from other parts of
      the neighborhood.

      The man props up a hand-painted sign, "Cowboy Pictures -- 15
      Cents," and lifts the first customer onto the pony
      positioning a cowboy hat on the child's head.

140   BACK TO SCENE                                                  140

      Another neighbor joins Easy and company, and they continue
      to laugh and talk, looking up from time to time to wave at
      friends in passing cars.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I thought about what Odell had said
                   about friends and it made sense to
                   me...

                   Odell goes to church every Sunday,
                   so he would know... Later on, he
                   challenged me to a game of
                   dominoes. And what'd he do that
                   for? We got to talkin' 'bout Texas
                   and fooled around and drunk almost
                   a quart of whiskey... And I forgot
                   about Daphne Monet, DeWitt Albright
                   and Carter and them... And sat with
                   my friend, on my porch at my
                   house... and we laughed a long
                   time...

                                                 FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. DESERT DUNES - DAWN

          CLOSE ON A WOODEN STICK-FIGURE TOY, held by a SIX YEAR OLD BOY.
          Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing --
          CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a
          small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their
          MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned
          MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil
          scene of life in another part of the world...

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

          A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with
          surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK
          MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to:

          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN

          POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN
          SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the
          cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned
          Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES:

          SPECIAL FORCES LEADER
          We have visual onthetarget. Confirm
          'go' for UAV launch.

          Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes:
           SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American;
           eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL
          THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated).

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active
          UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero.

          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN

          The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV
          into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent.

          INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the
          caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling
          the drone from 6500 miles away:

          DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The
          drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield --

          INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

          Over speakers, VOICES speak "Balochi." A TRANSLATOR listens:

          CALLISTER
          Is it him?

          TRANSLATOR
          Four males, one of them's speaking with
          a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ¢dialect,
          consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei.

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Gimme voiceprint analysis.
          The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation.
          VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a

          BEARDED MAN: "37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI."

          CALLISTER
          I'm not taking 37% to-the President...
          John, weigh in here?
          He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via
          teleconference from the White House Situation Room:

          DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
          CIA and NCTC concur this is the target
          based on reliable Intel from the Brits.
          WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road.

          TECHIE
          Sire they're pulling off the highway.

          TECHIE #2
          We have abort recommendation.
          The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The
          source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery.

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
          once in a lifetime, we can't let him go.

          CALLISTER
          (beat, torn)
          Alright, stay with him...

          Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the
          vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge...

          guided missiles --

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Looks like a training camp.
          THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he
          emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the
          file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm.
          MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP:
          THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL
          WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH -

          INSUFFICIENT DATA. RECOMMENDATION: ABORT MISSION."

          TECHIE
          51%. 'Abort' rec holds.
          THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin
          MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of
          the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT.
          THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds:

          CALLISTER
          What is that, a weapons cache?

          ANALYST
          Sir, the placement of stones around the
          pit, markers for the Five Pillars of
          Islam... I think it's a funeral.
          Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated.
          THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted,
          shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the
          procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body...
          THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION

          SCROLLS:

          TECHIE
          Sir, striking a funeral would put us in
          violation of the Geneva convention.

          PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL
          "Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open
          to international prosecution. But we
          have no independent intel verifying it's
          in fact a funeral, and the presence of
          weapons certainly leaves room for
          interpretation.

          TECHIE #2
          I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.

          CALLISTER
          (a beat, looks around).
          Everyone agree this is the best course of
          action?
          No one dissents. Callister picks up:

          CALLISTER (CONT'D)
          Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity
          match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some
          possibility he's at a funeral, but we
          don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks
          we can claim 'Overriding Legal
          Authority.' Also, you should be aware we
          have an abort recommendation, but your
          cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs
          urge a 'go.'

          THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
          You left yourself out of the lineup.
          Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS

          BLINKING: "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT..."

          CALLISTER
          Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two
          standards: the highest probability of
          success with the least amount of
          collateral damage. At 51% probability,
          we don't have either one.

          GENERAL THOMPSON
          And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir,
          we're putting our people at risk.
          There's a long silence as the President considers.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 5.

          THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
          I respect your caution, Geoff, but we
          won't get another chance like this... you
          have a green light.
          Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue:

          CALLISTER
          Understood.
          (hangs up)
          We're weapons free.
          And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:

          EXT. DESERT - FUNERAL - DAWN

          The women begin to SING the "Nasheen," a.funeral song praising
          Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE.
          DRONE POV: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE-CONE as it
          LAUNCHES its missile -- it ZOOMS toward the funeral gathering --
          The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before
          impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of
          running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand
          over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his
          mother's...

          A WHITE FLASH AS THE MISSILE HITS:

          CREDIT SE UENCE: WORDS CLOSE UP... a digitized electronic scan,
          as if they're being analyzed by someone: "We the people of the
          United States... more perfect union..." Highlights of The
          Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence...
          We land on: "...whenever any form of government becomes
          destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to
          abolish it..." CLOSE IN on these last words: "ABOLISH IT."

          WHITEWASH:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds --
          then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen:
          this is JERRY SHAW, 30, handsome, roguish. Somewhere between an
          adult and a child -- under his breath:

          JERRY
          damnit...

          CONTINUED:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          You gotta make a choice. You gotta move--

          JERRY
          -- I know.

           VOICE (O.S.)
           Now. Who are you gonna be?
           So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING
           CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from
          KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE
           game, CASH on the table.

           JERRY KWAME
           there. Dwarves?: Bullshit --
           Bullshit? I just blocked
           your ass and attacked with (checks card)

          -- read the oracle text, my
          friend. -- shit
          A thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK:

          BECKY
          You know what would be great? If you
          guys took a longer break. That'd be
          awesome.

          JERRY
          Hey, Becky? When're you going to start
          wearing makeup?
          Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry:

          BECKY
          .The collator's broken.

          JERRY
          Dude: no its not.

          BECKY
          (putting on a jacket)
          Oh yeah it is, dude!
          She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own
          smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson:

          JERRY
          Your first mistake? Underestimating
          dwarves. Power can come from anywhere --
          tomorrow night I'll give you first roll
          and a bonus pack if y--

          CONTINUED: ( 2)

          KWAME
          I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, remember?
          I'm going to Cornell.
          And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever we are,
          this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry.

          JERRY
          That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your
          last night. You're gonna spend it
          collating.

          KWAME
          -- what? But she said the collator's
          broken.

          JERRY
          And that's why we have those rubber
          thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations
          on Cornell, though, that's huge!
          TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his
          NAMETAG: "JERRY." Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES.
          He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up:

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you?
          The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets
          louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF:

          INT. "EL" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

          The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at
          their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS
          and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the
          train wall. A society lost in an "electronic elsewhere."
          And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good
          pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's
          got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage
          of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims:

          SHEPARD SMITH
          a heightened terror alert due to a
          series of suicide bombings, believed to
          be in retaliation for a deadly attack
          outside Abadan that killed forty people.
          Though the White House has denied
          involvement, Shia leaders have denounced
          the U.S. as responsible...

          Your embassies were only the beginning!
          Our warriors are already within your
          borders. Until American leadership is
          removed from power, Allah's revenge is
          upon you!
          And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are
          glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world...

          EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING

          An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM
          CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his
          attention: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS." He processes this a moment...
          his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT."

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING

          Saying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his
          mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month.
          A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO:

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING

          A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady.
          Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming:

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Jerry.

          JERRY
          Whatever are you cooking right now? Is
          the greatest thing I've ever smelled in
          my life, I swear to God --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you
          have the rent, yes?

          JERRY
          (puts cash in her hands)
          -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but
          I've got something else for you...
          something special...
          Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is.
          Sighs. Knows she can't resist him --

          INT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          CLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw
          him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other
          sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG,
          Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table.

          CONTINUED:

          JERRY
          So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's
          the best one so far ---

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Yes. Is good -- rent is better.
          She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
          You are hungry, I am guessing.

          JERRY
          Oh, no, no. I couldn't --
          (looking down at bowl)
          Unless, you know, you insist.
          He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          So where is girl? I don't see her?

          JERRY
          Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's
          over. She got smart.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Like the others.

          JERRY
          Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've
          discovered.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          You are like Johann.
          Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up.

          JERRY
          Your -- I'm like your dog?

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But
          he believe... he is terrier. So is
          Labrador... but no labrador.
          Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:

          JERRY
          why do you think that is?
          As she pours a drink into a plastic cup --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Perhaps many things. When I rescue
          Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.

          him feel not big.
          (hands Jerry the cup)
          You need someone for rescuing you.
          Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit:

          JERRY
          This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight-
          thirty in the morning --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka.
          Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS.
          He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
          Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are
          Labrador. Then ask if she give you money
          for rent.
          But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the
          phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly:

          JERRY
          its my mother.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Is problem?

          JERRY
          (even, quieter, gets up)
          is problem.

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT
          TO DO. Finally, he answers, as if ready for punishment:

          JERRY
          Hey, mom...
          Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is
          happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the
          floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain --

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands.
          Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi.
          Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do
          is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally,
          from somewhere, strength. He walks forward.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 11.

          INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of
          the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he
          passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry
          BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN
          pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses --
          Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him--

          JERRY
          -- no! I-- I'm not him!
          All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken:

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          It's okay! I'm not Paul!
          Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew.
          Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a
          lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN.
          Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body:
          And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that
          seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident.
          Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's
          identical twin. Off the surreal moment...
          A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's:

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, booming from a trumpet played by an 8 year-
          old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL
          HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but
          fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's
          knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a
          short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores:

          RACHEL
          Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down
          the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I
          went over, I said no TV--
          She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns
          her, momentarily, but she doesn't break stride --

          KYLE
          -- we're gonna be late, huh?

          RACHEL
          -- absolutely not -- I turned it off,

          She opens the fridge: HER KEYS sit atop a Tupperware container.
          Kyle hits a high note and we SLAM TO:

          INT. RACHEL'S CAR - MORNING

          The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The
          engine CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Rachel's tense--

          RACHEL
          we need to get a new car --

          KYLE
          I like your car. We're gonna be late.
          The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows
          up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out:

          RACHEL
          No we're not: the bus.

          KYLE
          -- are you kidding?

          EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

          Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling
          with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet
          case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)--

          RACHEL
          I put vitamins in your toiletry bag,
          don't forget to take two in the morning --

          KYLE
          and one at night, I know --

          RACHEL
          And your inhaler, which I may need to use
          now, is in the outside pocket -- wait!
          They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse:

          KYLE
          More bills?

          RACHEL
          Yup -- that's what happens when you have
          a kid on lay-away.
          They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the
          WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic:

          Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC--

          YOU SWORE!!
          As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her:

          RACHEL

          I KNOW, I'M SORRY!
          (Porsche HONKS as it

          PASSES)

          HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE!
          And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox --

          KYLE
          You swore again. Was that our bus?
          Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING
          THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!!

          RACHEL:
          Okay, now were gonna.be late.
          She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab --

          INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY

          A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and
          Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them --

          RACHEL
          Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!!

          WAIT!!
          Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles:

          MRS. MILLER
          Under the wire --

          RACHEL
          (gulping breaths)
          Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met--

          MRS. MILLER
          -- of course, Barbara Miller.
          (looks at watch)
          You should probably --
          And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards
          this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it.
          Turning Kyle to face her --

          RACHEL
          Okay. Now. I want you to have an
          awesome time --

          KYLE
          I will, mom --

          RACHEL
          -- you can eat junk food, just remember
          to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna
          goof off, just be really smart about it;
          and try not to stay up past your bedtime,
          you get really cranky when you do that'--
          (turns to Mrs. Miller)
           He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get
          at least eight --

          MRS. MILLER
          I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs.
          Holloman.
          Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them.
          Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto --

          RACHEL
          You see all these kids? They're all
          calling their mothers. You just do it
          more --

          KYLE
          It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you
          could try and some have fun too, wouldn't
          kill ya..

          RACHEL
          Fun? What's that?
           (hugging him)
           I love you so much, baby.You're my
           everything. Rock the house.

           KYLE
          -- love you too --
          They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller:

           RACHEL
          Call me!

          MRS. MILLER
          Your mom gonna be okay?

          KYLE
          It's unclear.
          As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES.
          Passing the BAGGAGE AREA...

          We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor
          belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER
          INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick-
          up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by...
          A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the
          strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in
          Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell?
          Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a

          INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON

          Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old
          people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES:

          WOMAN #1 (V.O.)
          you didn't know either?

          WOMAN #2 (V.0.)
          No idea.

          WOMAN #3 (V.0.)
          I knew he had a brother. But not a twin,
          that was...

          WOMAN.#1 (V.0.)
          I know, I know...
          Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances
          across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa.
          We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts.
          Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood.
          He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up
          there. So he does. We MOVE with him:

          WOMAN #1 (CCNT'D)
          when was the last time they saw him?

          WOMAN #2

          INT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY

          TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on
          Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that
          he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see:
          PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one
          framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE.
          Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it
          as a figure appears behind him...

          It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life.
          Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment.

          WILLIAM
          Six months without a boo or a bah.

          JERRY
          Didn't realize it'd been that long.

          WILLIAM
          Your mom was worried. So where were you
          this time?

          JERRY
          Nowhere.
          (then, a touch reticent)
          Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks.
          got a job for a while. On a...fishing
          boat. Met some great p-

          WILLIAM
          -- that's nice. Looks like you're really
          seeing the world.

          JERRY
          I'm trying, you know, just to --
          But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss.
          Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry
          hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again.
          And just then, William says, quietly, through tears:

          WILLIAM
          You sound just like him.
          Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And
          now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls
          back. Takes his wallet from his pocket:

           WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           I want to give you some, uh...

           JERRY
          No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really
          well. I promise.
          His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars.
          It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride
          to reject the offer? And the answer is...

          CLOSE ON THE PIN NUMBER AGAIN, getting PUNCHED IN. Then FIND
          JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father
          gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY
          CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen.

           AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO STARES, STUNNED. The
          screen reads: "BALANCE: $750,000.00"
           What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want
           him to hurry. He hits "Cancel." But the machine, as if
          disobeying, spits out five $100 bills--

           JERRY
           -- whoa --
           Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He
           glances at the people in line, nervous--

           JERRY (CONT'D)
           -- two seconds, sorry --
          Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand,
          pushes "cancel" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
          IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting JAMMED' in the slot. People
          start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from
          flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs
          all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Big date. So... fingers crossed.

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING.- HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Jerry enters, a little dazed -- heads for his apartment as Mrs.
          Wierzbowski steps from. hers, Johann hiding behind her:

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Jerry! All day they make delivery!
          Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath -- shoves a
          thousand dollars into her hand:

          JERRY
           Here's the rest of the rent -- next
          month's, too --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          -- where do you get this?

          JERRY
          Just take it -- it's okay, I owe you --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          I had to open your apartment, too many
          packages come, they come for hours --

          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jerry whips open his apartment door -- as far as he can: it's
          blocked by something. He reaches in, flips on the LIGHT: BOXES
          EVERYWHERE. Reeling, he picks one up, rips it open. Packing
          peanuts fly: a pair of night-vision binoculars. WHAT IS
          HAPPENING? Goes through more boxes in a flurry of CUTS:
           FALSE PASSPORTS; a POLICE SCANNER; BODY ARMOR; HAND GUNS; large
          BAGS OF FERTILIZER; strange CHEMICALS; 747 MANUALS. Jerry looks
          around, fear and confusion growing. His cell rings.,. startles
          him -- all the LCD says is: "ANSWER NOW."

          JERRY
          -- hello?
          A WOMAN'S VOICE. We can't place why... but it's really creepy.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Look out your window. They're coming for
          you.

          JERRY
          (totally thrown)
          -- what? Who is this?

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Jerry. You have to run.

          JERRY
          Who the hell is this?!
          Rips back the curtain to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP -- a flack-
          jacketed TEAM pours out, assault rifles ready. Jerry goes pale.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
           Leave your residence. Get to the Mathis
          train station. You have 4 minutes.

          JERRY
          Jesus Christ -- what's happening?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Run, or you'll be captured and convicted
          -- go NOW.
          CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE. Jerry whirls,
          goes out to the hall, hears THEM coming. Starts to run. But a

          TACTICAL TEAM STORMS THE HALL. ASSAULT RIFLES AIMED AT HIM:

          TEAM LEADER JERRY
          Hands behind your head! DOWN WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY! IS

          NOW! DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR WE THIS ABOUT THE--THE ATM?! I

          INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Jerry sits cuffed to a table. Frightened, confused, on the
          defensive. The door opens and AGENT THOMAS MORGAN enters: 40s,
          born to the job, never smiles. Takes a seat, opens a "file:

          JERRY
          Look, man, I don't know what this is -- I
          don't know how all that shit got in my
          apartment, but unless you're my lawyer--

          MORGAN
          My condolences. I understand you've had
          a tough day.

          JERRY
          it hasn't been ideal.

          MORGAN
          Your brother worked for the State
          Department.
          This was almost a question. And while it's obviously news to
          us, Jerry clearly knew...

          JERRY
          You tell me.

          MORGAN
          Were you close?

          JERRY
          Why? What am I doing here. I don't even
          know who you are.
          Morgan tosses his black leather BADGE WALLET onto the metal
          table. It lands open with a substantial CLUNG!

          MORGAN
          Tom Morgan, Special Agent attached to the
          National Counterterrorism Center.

          JERRY
          (stares, rocked)
          Counterterrorism Center? You think I'm --

          MORGAN
          -- according to phone records, your
          brother called you twelve times in the
          last year. You never called him back.

          JERRY
          If you're asking if we were the kind of
          freaky twins you see at the mall wearing
          the same shirt, no. Listen, Paul
          traveled a lot, so we didn't --

          Oh. That's right. He stamped visas in
          Karachi for a year. Then was a junior
          FSO in Beirut. Interesting places.

          JERRY
          What're you... saying.

          MORGAN
          I'm just saying you didn't talk much.
          maybe you did.

          JERRY
          Am I getting a lawyer here? 'Cause
          didn't hear my rights read to me--

          MORGAN
          You familiar with the slogan, "Declare
          War on War?"

          JERRY
          what? No, why?
          Morgan pulls out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a
          STUDENT RALLY holding up a sign with an image of the Pentagon
          crossed out in red: "DECLARE WAR ON WAR!"

          MORGAN
          Because you painted it when you were part
          of the student activist group "Project
          Underground" at Berkley.

          JERRY
          (stares-at pic; LAUGHS)
          Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was
          Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd
          ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've
          gone to an "Anti-Oxygen" rally for her.
          I swear to God, dude--

          MORGAN
          Don't "dude" me. I'm not your friend. I
          don't have friends... so: Jerry. Why'd
          you drop out of school?

          JERRY
          Why'd you stay in? I don't know, I
          didn't really see the point.

          MORGAN
          You haven't been able to hold a job

          JERRY
          Unless I've been fired from Kinko's,
          which is a statistical impossibility, I'm
          holding a job right now.

          INT. DHS OBSERVATION ROOM - HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

          Morgan meets supervisor MARTIN KREBS, a senior D.H.S. big wig.
          Standing with LATESHA.SIMMS, 32 but looks 16, African-American,
          computer wonk with no room fora personal life; and TOBY GRANT,
          20's, straight part in his hair, wet behind the ears. They've
          all been observing through a two-way mirror. Latesha refers to
          a laptop, one she clutches like a safety blanket:

          LATESHA
          He fits the profile: disaffected,
          'susceptible to radical indoctrination,
          problem with authority. Doesn't vote or
          pay taxes, but witness statements all say
          he's not a player. He does sketches of
          his landlady's dog. Oh, and he's lying
          about the woman who called him -- we
          checked the records, no calls came in
          before we picked him up --

          KREBS
          What about the brother?

          LATESHA
          Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past
          three years. No red flags. He was
          killed when a truck ran a light in
          Crystal City.

          MORGAN
          That kind of equipment and a major cash
          infusion five hours after a terrorist
          threat and were smiling and saying
          "coincidence?"

          KREBS
          So either he's a rank-and-file sleeper or
          a dumbshit mule.

          GRANT
          (eager to contribute)
          Or a misdirect. There's nothing subtle
          about him or the gear. He's not exactly
          a pro--
          Morgan levels a look at Grant as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring
          out the next move:

          KREBS
          Get Smith on financials; Rieger on
          travel; and let's dryclean family and
          friends. Again.
          (to Morgan, veiled

          THREAT)
          I don't want the FBI rushing in on this.
          Break him. Fast.
          And leaves Morgan to twist.. The pressure's on. To Latesha:

          MORGAN
          v m m putting you on the brother.

          LATESHA
          Great, I'll access State's database

          MORGAN
          No, I want you to go there.

          LATESHA
          But, Tom, I can do everything from

          MORGAN'S VOICE
          you know those funny things underneath
          that not-so-stylish pantsuit? They're
          called leas.
          Latesha looks at him, not happy.

          LATESHA
          Yes. Sir.

          MORGAN
          You know I hate it when you call me that--
          He turns to go, Grant immediately following him --

          INT. GAMMAGE & BURNHAM LAW OFFICES - WISCONSIN - NIGHT

          Rachel's doing paperwork at her desk. People leave. for the
          night. An attorney named MICHAEL approaches; warm, good-
          looking, by all standards, a catch. She doesn't look up.

          MICHAEL
          He's out of town.

          RACHEL
          Yup.

          MICHAEL
          Which seems like a perfect ;opportunity
          for a second date. In theory.

          RACHEL
          In theory -- but I gotta site-check this
          brief, courier's coming in,.,the morning.

          MICHAEL
          Didn't we have a good time? Remember
          that? Our first date? Back in the 40's?
          He's so agreeably genuine, she wants to let him down easy:

          RACHEL
          I had a great. time, I told you that
          but I'm so busy and...

          MICHAEL
          Ooo.o, shit, the "so busy" speech -- stop
          -- not worthy of you. Or me. I'm
          patient, so... call me. When you're not
          busy.

          RACHEL
          Kyle goes to college in nine years-- it
          should be somewhere around then.

          MICHAEL
          I would so wait a decade for you. Call
          me his sophomore year, I'll prove it.
          And with a smile he heads off. She watches him go -- dammit!
          really liking him in this moment. She watches longer than she
          should... then goes back to her work.
          He gets in the elevator and she's left in her solitude. And now
          we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs of it: loneliness.

          CONTINUED:
          The consequence of not really letting anyone into her life. She
          stares off as BLING! An IM box pops up on her screen:
          "RACHEL HOLLOMAN. ANSWER THE PHONE." And just like that the
          PHONE RINGS. Rachel jumps. Staring at the IM. Then at the
          phone. Answers it:

          RACHEL
          -- hello?
          It's the same chilling FEMALE VOICE:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Click on the link at the bottom of the
          page.
          Rachel's eyes drop down to the LINK at the bottom of her screen.
          What? Leans out from her cubicle to look around -- NO ONE ELSE

          AT THEIR DESK.

          RACHEL
          who is this?
          As she clicks on the link. And a STREAMING IMAGE APPEARS: A

          BLACK AND WHITE SURVEILLANCE CAM OFKYLE ON HIS TRAIN, LAUGHING
          WITH OTHER KIDS. Rachel's breath is taken away--

          What's going on? Who are you --?

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Would you risk your life for your son?
          Rachel jumps to her feet,: trying to breathe through the panic.
          Looking around. NO ONE -

          RACHEL
          This isn't funny! Who are you?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Ican derail his train. I can kill him
          at any time. I'll ask again: would you
          risk`. your life for your son?
          Suddenly the BROWSER GOES BLANK: "UNABLE TO ACCESS PAGE."
          Kyle's taken from her, that fast -- she gasps, terrified.

          RACHEL
          yes...

          WOMAN'S VOICE

           A FAX spits out a page with the Department of Justice logo, from
           the ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. Subject: "SHAW, JERRY."

          INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER

          Jerry sits in his cell, lost -- looks up as an Agent enters:

          AGENT
          Time for your phone call.

          JERRY
          I thought there was no phone call.

          AGENT
          Attorney General's office changed their
          mind.

          INT. DHS FILED OFFICE - SECURE PHONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Jerry's led into a holding room with a phone on the wall. The
          Agent exits, electronic door locking behind him. Jerry thinks,
          deciding who to call. Swallows his;_pride, starts to dial his
          father. It RINGS. BUT THE RINGING SUDDENLY, EERILY LOWERS IN

          PITCH IN A DIGITAL GLITCH -- AN ODD.CONNECTION CLICK.

          JERRY
          hello? Dad--?

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          I told you to. run. You didn't.
          TIGHT ON JERRY now, terrified, breathless --

          JERRY
          .no wav -- who are you?!
          Behind Jerry; the steel door UNLOCKS -- he whirls to the OPENING
          DOOR -- waiting for a Guard -- someone, anyone... BUT NO ONE
          COMES.::: What the hell is this?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Follow the water. Or the fire will kill
          you.

          JERRY
          What fire?! How'd you get on this
          phone?! Are you the one doing all this
          to me? Why?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Follow the water. Leave the building --
          -- and Jerry SPINS BACK. Looks up at a WALL VENT near the
          ceiling -- SMOKE. Ho-shit! A SMOKE ALARM BLARES --

          JERRY
          Wait, what d'you mean "follow the water"?
          Suddenly: TSHHHHH! Jerry turns -- in the hallway, a CEILING
          SPRINKLER SPRAYS. The FIRE GROWS, RAGING from the VENT --

          JERRY (CONT'D)

          SHIT!!!

          INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          People scramble -- Morgan runs to the interrogation room, sees
          through the glass that Jerry's gone. To a passing Agent:

          MORGAN
          Where's Shaw?

          AGENT
          Parker took him to make his phone call.

          MORGAN
          Took him?! On whose authority?!

          INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE -.HALLWAY - NIGHT

          SMOKE AND FIRE AND A BLARING ALARM as Jerry FOLLOWS THE
          SPRINKLERS -- amazingly'each sprinkler ACTIVATES as he
          approaches, creating a safe path through the flames. Finally he
          gets to a dead end -- a WINDOW -- the FIRE RAGING behind him,
          heat increasing, as Jerry GRABS A NEARBY CHAIR AND --

          MORGAN (V.0.)

          JERRY SHAW!!
          Turns through the wild FIRE, Morgan, at the other end of the
          corridor -- GUN DRAWN:

          MORGAN (CONT'D)

          FREEZE, RIGHT THERE!

          JERRY

          LISTEN TO ME! I'M NOT TRYING TO ESCAPE!
          The fire ERUPTS between them, obscuring each other's view. No
          choice, Jerry turns, HURLS the chair at the WINDOW, IT SHATTERS:

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 28.

          EXT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

           Jerry prepares himself, then JUMPS TO A DRAIN PIPE -- grabbing
          it and lowering himself from the third floor -- dropping the
          last ten feet, landing HARD, recovering, running off --

          EXT. RAISED SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

          A SUBWAY TRAIN pulls into the station. WHIP PAN to find Jerry
          running onto the platform -- out-of-his-mind-scared -- passes a
          SURVEILLANCE CAMERA looking down, as if watching him --
          Jerry's eyes scan the area... then he FREEZES. THE ELECTRONIC

          SCHEDULE SIGN HAS CHANGED TO READ: "JERRY, BOARD TEE TRAIN"

          THEN JUST AS FAST, ITS BACK TO THE SCHEDULE.
          HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?! Across the station, Jerry sees Morgan
          and a team of Agents pouring down the stairs =- he runs onto the
          train as the DOORS CLOSE -- Morgan turns, doesn't see him.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

          The train at full speed. Oblivious Commuters. Jerry tries to
          calm down, make some sense. Notices. the SECURITY CAMERA in the
          corner, turns from it. An LCD.onthe train broadcasts CNN:

          CNN NEWSCASTER
          has elevated our alert status to
          threat level "Orange." Insiders say
          tomorrow night's State of the Union
          address will focus on...

          CONDUCTOR (V.0.)
          Next stop, Montrose Station.
          A CELL RINGS from a phone peeking out of a SLEEPING PASSENGER'S
          BACKPACK. He looks at it, oddly suspicious. The LCD GOES BLACK
          -- then the words "ANSWER IT, JERRY" appear. Looks around: no
          one saw it. Slips the phone from the guy's backpack -- turns
          away, hits "answer":

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Stay on the train for three more stations
          until you r--
          But Jerry HANGS UP -- WON'T HAVE THIS. And as the train slows,
          he moves to the door and --

          EXT. MONTROSE STATION - NIGHT

          JUMPS off the train, pushes through the busy platform. Spots
          TWO TRANSIT OFFICERS talking on radios as they scan the crowd.
          Jerry turns and ducks into another TRAIN just as --

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 29.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

          The DOORS CLOSE. Jerry sits, exhales. Then the cell phone --
          which he stole -- RINGS AGAIN. He tenses. Won't answer. It
          finally stops ringing. Could it all be over? NO, BECAUSE THE

          TRAIN'S EMERGENCY BRAKES SUDDENLY KICK IN, GEARS SCREECH, PEOPLE
          TUMBLE... and the train stops. Everyone looks around, confused,
          frightened. Suddenly, the train starts MOVING BACKWARDS--

          JERRY

          --NO--

          EXT. REAR SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

          The rear subway car's now become the front. TILT DOWN to the
          track, it SWITCHES OVER to another line all.by itself --

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

          People are FREAKING OUT -- and Jerry feels some insane guilty
          complicity in all this, as the PHONE.RINGS AGAIN--

          JERRY
          -- Jesus --
           (and he answers)

          HELLO.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          I told you not to get off yet.

          JERRY
          -- listen -- lady -- who are you?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          He knows you're here.
          Jerry turns and sees A TRANSIT COP through the glass doors that
          connect the cars -- he's talking into a shoulder-mounted walkie
          talkie. Looking right at JERRY --

          JERRY
          --.how do you know that? Where are you?
          Jerry notices ANOTHER SECURITY CAMERA in the corner as:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Next stop is Damen Station. Take the
          Northwest exit. There will be a black
          BMW sedan. Get in the passenger seat.

          JERRY
          Go to hell. How's that.
          He hangs up, drops the phone and STOMPS ON IT. Eyes from fellow
          passengers. THEN EVERY CELL PHONE ON BOARD RINGING IN UNISON.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 30.

          CONTINUED:
          Jerry watches, stunned, as passengers start answering -- all
          hearing the same thing:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          The man in the black t-shirt is a wanted
          terrorist. His name is Jerry Shaw.
          Everyone TURNS TO Jerry, backs away, but a HUGE MAN stands:

          HUGE MAN
          -- you Jerry Shaw?
          EVERYONE looking, a few even start to move for him. Jerry goes
          for the door, but the SUBWAY COP'S there, about to enter, but
          the door's locked. Jerry yells to the passengers.:

          JERRY

          STAY AWAY FROM ME!
          The COP pulls his gun, yelling through the glass:

          TRANSIT COP

          EVERYBODY DOWN! GET DOWN?
          Suddenly, the train SPEEDING, the DOORS OPEN! A BLAST OF WIND!
          People SCREAM, take cover as the.train .pulls into the station,
          the COP about to SHOOT when Jerry jumps, LANDING HARD ON THE
          PLATFORM -- ROLLS -- and the COP FIRES! People SCREAM and RUN,
          as the moving train separates Jerry from the Cop -- Jerry gets
          to his feet, sprints towards the northwest exit and --

          EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

          Out of the station! Spots the BLACK 760 BMW SEDAN parked by the
          curb -- sleek, ultra-fast. Jerry tears open the passenger door,
          jumps inside, meeting, behind the wheel:

          INT. BMW 760 SEDAN - NIGHT

           RACHEL. Terrified. Assuming Jerry is behind all of this.
           Jerry, breathing hard, assuming she is The Voice:

          Turn left in two-hundred feet.
          Indeed they do: TWO POLICE CARS BLAST AROUND A STREET CORNER

          -- you don't know anything Your son?! No, I know
          about Kyle? nothing! Just like you don't

          I know I got it!
          And she YANKS the steering wheel and the.car makes a FRIGHTENING
          SCREAMING LEFT TURN as we CUT TO:

          INT. SUV - CHICAGO CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Morgan drives a government-issue sedan at 80 mph. over radio:

           POLICE RADIO (V.0.)

          Morgan makes a hard right, .tearing around a corner --

          INT. BMW - CHICAGO CITY STREETS - NIGHT

          Two cop cars have become THREE in the rearview mirror -- even
          more insane, Â°all.the TRAFFIC LIGHTS are suddenly changing to
          create a MIRACLE PATH for the BMW -- stopping traffic to let
          them pass,. starting it up again to CUT OFF the cop cars. It's
          as if someone.'s.playing chess with the city grid--

          RACHEL JERRY

          Rachel looks up too -- eyes wide: A TEN-STORY-TALL CONSTRUCTION

          CRANE TURNING FAST, THE BLOCK-LONG ARM SWINGING ABOVE THE

          STREET, HOLDING FIVE STEEL GIRDERS--

           JERRY (CONT'D)
          -- sixt ! Go to sixty!
           And suddenly the crane DROPS THE GIRDERS -- Rachel SCREAMS --

           JERRY (CONT'D)

          SHIT!!
          And the STEEL BEAMS SLAM INTO THE PAVEMENT, JUST BEHIND THE BMW,

          RACHEL
          -- this isn't happening!!!
          Tries to DOWNSHIFT -- GRINNNNNNNND!!

          JERRY RACHEL

          CLUTCH! I'M CLUTCHING!!
          She tries to shift -- Jerry puts his hand on hers -- JAMS THE
          GEAR SHIFT INTO FOURTH -- the car swerves to avoid a car:

          JERRY

          GO RIGHT GO RIGHT!!!
          Rachel yanks the wheel, SKIDS round the corner -- more police
          screech in ahead -- she's forced to VEER onto a ONE-WAY STREET!

          HERE!!
          The BMW barely avoids one collision after another --

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          You'll turn at the next alley: avoid the
          police.
          Rachel skids right, but TWO COP CARS appear. Too late to stop
          WHAM! The BMW SMASHES THROUGH -- both cop cars go flying.

          RACHEL

          AVOID THEM?!

          They're headed for the harbor! Gimme
          roadblocks at Granville and Sheridan!
          IN THE BMW: Jerry and Rachel speed through an industrial marina.
          Up ahead, the intersection's closed by a POLICE BARRICADE.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Turn right in two-hundred feet.
          MORGAN'S CAR: he SEES Rachel coming right at him. Just before
          they collide, she TURNS RIGHT. Morgan SLAMS his brakes -- his
          car FISHTAILS -- the cruisers behind him come to a.stop; but now

          BLOCK HIS WAY.

          MORGAN

          RACHEL JERRY

          ACCELERATE?! WE"RE HEADED FOR THE WATER!
          -- are you trying to kill us?! -- slow down! Jesus, slow

          -- Oh! Rachel! -- Rachel: SLOW THE HELL

          DOWN!!!
          Just then: KA-CHUNK!! Something just SLAMMED onto the ROOF -- a
          high-pitched VREEEEE as he car's tires SPIN in overdrive but
          suddenly FIND NO ROAD BENEATH THEM! And impossibly, as the
          brick wall GROWS HUGE coming right at us through the windshield,
          the car RISES OFF THE GROUND -- LITERALLY FLYING --

          JERRY RACHEL

          HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?!?! I'M NOT!!!
          -- and now we REVEAL: A GIANT, INDUSTRIAL MAGNET attached to the
          top of the BMW, HOISTING it up on a DOCK CRANE -- the jib arm
          PIVOTS, swinging them over a CRANE YARD...
          Minds blown, they swing past the crane's DRIVER'S SEAT and
          see... NOBODY'S AT THE CONTROLS. The crane DIPS THEM toward a
          wooden railing overlooking the RIVER -- they CRASH THROUGH it.
          The release arm DROPS the BMW -- Jerry and Rachel SCREAM as they
          PLUMMET -- but the car doesn't hit water, instead it falls onto:
          A GARBAGE BARGE floating downriver. The car lands in a mountain
          of trash. The crane STOPS, just as... Morgan and the cops
          APPEAR, screeching in at the broken railing.

          CONTINUED:
          They jump from their cars, look down into the river and see
          NOTHING. Morgan KICKS a trash can, pissed:

          MORGAN
          Seal the harbor, get divers in the water!
          PAN UP TO the horizon... where the garbage barge floats lazily
          down Lake Michigan. Jerry and Rachel escaped... for now.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BARGE - DAWN

          Jerry, dazed but driven, SLAMS a piece of plywood again and
          again into the LEXAN WINDOW of the barge's CONTROL BOOTH.
          Rachel paces, on her cell -- hearing:

           KYLE'S VOICE
           This is Kyle. Who is not allowed to. use
           this phone with my friends... so leave a

           Honey? Honey? It's me -- Baby, you need
           to call me. Soon as you get this, 1 please
          -- check your messages and.call me.
          Sweetie. I love y_ou.
          And she hangs up, staring'off. CRASH! Jerry's knocked the
          window back -- opens the control booth door and enters, examines
          the controls. The computer panel reads: "CONTROL OVERRIDE."

          JERRY
          -- this thing's on auto-pilot or
          something. Which doesn't happen, these
          barges are operated, by people.
          He steps out. In thought, tears in her eyes, Rachel asks:

          RACHEL
          D'youthink -- she could derail a train?

          JERRY
          Are you kidding me? She changed every
          traffic light! This woman's called me on
          other people's phones -- some dude who
          happened to be sitting next to me! His
          phone rang -- it was her! For me! She
          broke me out of maximum-security custod
          in a way I'm not even gonna tell you
          cause you won't believe it -- and you
          saw how she directed us away from the
          police, then lifted us outta the world
          and dropped our ass onto the ghost barge!
          Can she derail a train? She could
          probably turn a train into a duck. Yes.
          I think she c--

          CONTINUED:
          -- but now he stops, because Rachel is crying. Jerry lamely
          attempts to backpedal:

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          I mean... I don't know, I'm not sure she
          could derail a train, what the hell do I
          know?
          Rachel brushes her tears away. Afraid, but fighting it.

          RACHEL
          My son is on a train. She threatened to
          kill him if I don't do what she says.
          They share a look. The difference between them galvanized in an
          instant. She has something to lose.

          RACHEL (CONT'D)
          You tell me -- how does someone do all
          this?
          When: RING! A CELL PHONE. Rachel looks down, hoping it's Kyle
          -- but it's not her phone. They realize the phone's somewhere
          in the trash. Jerry starts digging. It's nast Finally, he
          finds it in an old take-out box --- re: the phone.

          JERRY
          -- you see what I mean?
          He wipes it off, holds it to his ear despite the stench;

           JERRY (CONT'D)
          Hello?

           WOMAN'S VOICE
           You both need to swim to shore. Go to

          JERRY
          Lady, what if I told you we don't know
          how to swim.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          But you do. I've seen you at the beach
          house.
          (Jerry is chilled)
          And the female was once a swimming
          instructor at the YMCA in Westport,
          Connecticut. Go now or the authorities
          will find you. They're more dangerous
          than the water.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          CLICK -- she's gone. Jerry hangs up, turning something
          unnerving in his mind.

          JERRY
          She called you "the female."
          (beat, weird)
          That's like... something a foreigner would
          say, like a bad translation. But she has
          no accent.

          RACHEL
          Jerry, that's your name, right? Are we
          swimmincr?

          JERRY
          Does it bring back memories of
          Westport Y?

          RACHEL
          (pale, at a whisper)
          how did you know that?

          JERRY
          I didn't.
          And they turn to look down at the FREEZING RIVER WATER as we PRE-

          An OLD MAN blowing into KYLE,'S TRUMPET. Thick glasses, sweater
          vest, INSTRUMENTS stacked all over the place. Kyle's familiar
          CASE with the Packers' sticker open next to him.

          STORE OWNER
          You sure you want to replace it? Sounds
          pretty good to me.
          And we reveal MIDDLE EASTERN MAN standing at the counter. Eyes

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          Yes. I'm sure. Please do it now.
          The Store Owner looks into the box.

          STORE OWNER

          The Middle Eastern Man. MUMBLING again in Tajiki. Seemingly,
          to himself. The Store Owner stares, kinda freaked out --

          The Middle Eastern Man suddenly touches his ear, BARKS out
          something in Tajiki. Like he's arguing with someone.

          STORE OWNER (CONT'D)

          INT. RIVER SIDE - DAY

          A Coast Guard cutter floats beside the now-abandoned garbage
          barge. The BMW's been lifted ashore by a crane -- FORENSIC
          TECHS comb every inch. MORGAN circles the car. Grant follows,
          a WAITING CHOPPER in the background.

          AGENT GRANT
          All the surveillance cameras in the area
          have turned up nothing -- no ID on the

          All I want is a goddamn picture of her --

          fax from Justice, was that
          equipment failure too? -- No sir, there's gotta be

          Pissed, Morgan starts -- fast -- for the chopper -- we move with
          him and Grant, who keeps up:

          MORGAN
          The getaway car was waiting there -- get
          me a witness description on the woman
          driving -- remember witnesses? People
          who see things?! Jesus, is this a lost
          art?

          AGENT GRANT

          Yes sir!
          As Morgan hops up onto the moving chopper --

          MORGAN
          Nobody who works for me calls me sir.
          understand?! It's disingenuous -- might
          as well be calling me 'asshole.'

          EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY

          An endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers...
          Two FIGURES, like specks against the landscape -- Jerry and
          Rachel, walking, wet, cold. And then:

          RACHEL
          So you're a twin.

          (BEAT)
          Who works at a copy place.
          And she manages a clipped, judgemental (frankly rude) laugh.

          JERRY
          Yeah, I know... that's occurred to me.

          CONTINUED:

          RACHEL
          So this whole situation is obviously
          about him.

          JERRY
          Excuse me? I would offer this whole
          situation isn't "obviously" about
          anything.

          RACHEL
          Just think about it: you said your
          brother worked at the State Department --

          JERRY
          -- so what?

          RACHEL
          -- so that means he could've: been into
          anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you..received
          a shipment of weapons and cash and
          airplane manuals -- it seems to me that
          they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother--

          JERRY
          Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all
          that stuff was for Paul?
          As they approach TOWER 108:

          RAC HE L
          Hey, I'm sorry that he died, I'm not
          trying to insult his memory --

          JERRY
          he hasn't been dead long enough to
          become a memory! And if you knew Paul,
          which you did not, you'd laugh all day at
          the idea that he was a spy or terrorist
          or whatever you're implying --

          RACHEL
          I'm implying if not him... then why you?

          JERRY
          Well hasn't that been the question my
          whole life. You know how I know Paul
          wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had
          been, he would've been the best fucking
          terrorist in history: he wouldn't have
          gotten caught, the United States would be
          a crater -- he would've won awards for
          being a great terrorist.

          (THEN)
          What about you? Why'd she choose you --
          what's your day job? I know it isn't
          "manual-shift driver."

          CONTINUED: (2)

          RACHEL
          I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a
          paralegal -- I have no connection to
          anything.

          JERRY
          Really?
          Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST
          approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT,
          grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished:

          RACHEL
          Someone's coming.
          And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It
          comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands
          some twenty-five feet from them.

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          Are you Jerry Shaw?

          JERRY
          who are you?
           Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket --

           JERRY (CONT'D) MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          -- Whoa -- I dropped it off like she
          said. I'm done.
          The man's pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL KEY.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          -- dropped off what? Who are you?

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          Take it --
          He TOSSES the key..-- it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between
          them. Then:

          JERRY
          what's it for?

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          I don't know -- I don't care -- but I
          will not drive you. You take the van
          (touches his EAR: beat)
          I'm not listening to you any more!
          And the man turns to go, just walks away.

          RACHEL JERRY
          -- hey! -- wait, who are you?! You
          have to tell us what you know!

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 42

          CONTINUED: (3)
          And as the man walks away from them his CELL PHONE RINGS: He
          pulls it out -- the LCD READS: "LAST CHANCE." And the man
          DROPS the phone and just starts RUNNING --

          JERRY

          WAIT!!
          And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches
          up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round --

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          What do you know?

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          -- let me go!

          JERRY
          -- who's doing this?
          And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL
          PHONE RINGS. Rachel. Terrified, hesitant. Knows somehow its
          for her -- she answers:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Stop him now or he will die.

          RACHEL
          (looking around)
          How are you seeing us?!
          Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing.
          Throwing sloppy punches:

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          Let go of me!
          On Rachel:

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Stop him now.
          CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man --

          RACHEL
          Stop! You have to STOP!
          When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes
          sprawling. He takes off again, yelling back:

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          I cannot! I have a family!!!

          RACHEL
          She's going to KILL YOU!

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 43.

          CONTINUED: (4)
          And just then, something TERRIFYING: an IMMENSE POWER SURGE --
          HEARD, FELT -- and a SIX-STORY-HIGH COIL THE SIZE OF AN SUV
          EXPLODES IN SPARKS. CABLES BLAST FREE. Rachel SCREAMS. Jerry
          TACKLES HER TO SAFETY as the tree trunk cables SWING DOWN AND
          STRIKE THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN and he is SLAMMED OFF HIS FEET,
          the current making the cable STICK TO HIM LIKE GLUE.
          And he's ON FIRE INSTANTLY -- SMOKE EVERYWHERE as he's TOSSED BY

          THE HORRIFYING TENTACLE, POUNDED INTO THE GROUND, BACK INTO THE

          AIR, PUMMELLED DOWN AGAIN, BURNING...
          Jerry and Rachel watch this in horror -- until she looks away.
           Jerry holding her -- the two in shock, strangers, in each -
           other's arms. Having shared another moment, too real, horror -

          RACHEL (CONT'D) JERRY.
          Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something,
          God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what
          to.. what...
          And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer
          it. Another RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand
          shaking slightly:

          JERRY
          You killed him... you killed that man...

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive
           to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street.
           Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey
           and you die.
          CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry.

           JERRY RACHEL
          she wants us to drive to
          Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? --
          -- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep
           happening! We have to go to
           the police, explain it --
           explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not
          gonna tell them?! going anywhere!
          Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders:

          JERRY
          -- Rachel. She's watching us. Right
          now. You wanna die too? Your son? We
          have to go.
          Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And
          nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS, LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT

          THINK -- AND AT THE HEIGHT OF AN UNRESOLVED CHORD, IT --

          EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY


          -- STOPS.
          Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We PAN a barren
          landscape. Scattered scorch marks. Then, a high-pitched TONE
          as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck,
          which gives us scale to understand the SUDDEN COLOSSAL EXPLOSION

          THAT SHAKES OUR BEING -- HOLY FUCK THAT THING WAS HUGE AND AS

          DEBRIS IS STILL RIPPED INTO THE SKY, PIECES ARE COMING DOWN AND
          THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR HOURS as a SUPER APPEARS:

          "BRIAR POINT TEST RANGE -- ABERDEEN, MARYLAND. "-
           And we hear CLAPPING -- PULL BACK, realizing that we are inside:

          INT. PROTECTIVE BARRACKS - DAY

          -- a high-tech bunker-like structure with six-inch LEXAN
          WINDOWS. A dozen MILITARY BRASS are here, applauding. Among
          them is Callister. He seems more thoughtful about this. Behind
          him, a British, DARK-SUITED WEAPONS';DEVELOPER speaks:

          WEAPONS DEVELOPER
          That blast was the result of one single
          crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of
          you who are new today, "Rex" is an
          isotope that leaves no chemical markers --
          it's eighty times more powerful than C4.
          Odorless. Undetectable.
          COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures:

          COLONEL THOMPSON
          Talk about the detonating system...
          The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of
          compressed air, saying:

          WEAPONS DEVELOPER
          Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency
          undetectable to the human ear. For this
          test we made it audible -- that was the
          tone you heard before the explosion --
          the tone was the trigger.

          CALLISTER
          What's the risk that another sound could
          accidentally detonate it?
          (half smile)
          A song on a radio? A howling dog?

          WEAPONS DEVELOPER
          No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and
          impossible to reproduce.

          Thank you, sir. We're proud of this

          set of DOUBLE-DOORS. Some very big meeting about to happen -

          LATESHA
          That's the point. No one'll tell me. I

          JERRY
          wow. And you. Hm.
          She turns to him. Eyes burning into the side of his head.
          Knows what he's thinking.

          RACHEL
          Parents weren't allowed to go... is that

          JERRY
          Is it okay? I could give a shit.

          You think I should have gone with him
          anyway.

          JERRY
          I'm just thinking, sounds like a big
          deal, especially for a 9-year-old --
          playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just
          think at least one parent might wanna be
          there to see it.

          RACHEL
          Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't
          there?

          JERRY
          Well, you're not wearing a ring and you
          haven't mentioned anyone but your son is
          on that train. Even the most pissed off
          ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you
          aren't -- would've mentioned it if her
          ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle
          was going to meet his dad in DC? You

          You can't leave me!

          JERRY
          Why not? My brother's a terrorist, and
          I'm a loser right?
          He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her door

          RACHEL
          Don't walk away!

          JERRY
          (throwing up arms)
          I'm done.

          RACHEL
          Please!

          JERRY
          You're on your own.
          Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin :

          RACHEL
          Please! PLEASE! I..i need you!
          Jerrystops short. Turning around. Cupping his ear.

          JERRY
          I'm sorry? What'd you just say?

          RACHEL
          I can't do this without you.

          JERRY
          You mean without the "man-child?"
          Rachel's reserves crumble.

          RACHEL
          Its the first time we've been apart, me
          and Kyle. Since the day he was born.
          And I let him get on that train--
          (almost whispering)
          -- I let him get on.
          Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's
          eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her.

          JERRY
          No more accusing my brother of shit you
          know nothing about, is that understood?
          Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again --

           And so. They turn around. And get back in the van.

          EXT. TOWER 108 - DAY


          THE CHARRED FACE OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN, FROZEN IN A SCREAM.
          Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to
          keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene.

          POWER WORKER
          Never seen anything like it. Power blew
          out from Franklin High School down to the
          river club. I can't explain it -
          They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared.

          SHERIFF
          No I.D. We know he's male, though.
          Probably in his 20's.
          (points off)
          Tire treads entering and leaving the
          scene over three. Three sets of shoe
          prints.

          MORGAN
          And we're about 4 miles from the river --
          Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on
          some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call:

          AGENT GRANT
          Agent Morgan!"
          (out of breath, sotto)
          Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from
          Justice that got Shaw his phone call?
          Came from inside Justice.

          MORGAN
          Inside?! You absolutely sure on that?

          AGENT GRANT
          Yes, s--
          (catches himself)
          Yes I am.

          MEDICAL EXAMINER
          Got something --
          As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a
          small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for
          them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS --

          GRANT
          Looks like a bone mic, military grade.

          market.
          (looks around landscape)
          Someone was talking to him.
          Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten
          everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the
          chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him:

          SHERIFF
          We'll be needing that for evidence!

          EXT. 56TH STREET - DAY

          Jerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF
          INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The
          parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves
          for the inevitable...

          RACHEL
          a Federal bank?

          JERRY
          Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal
          Prison.

          INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY

          A wall-mounted clock ticks to "11:00"--WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel
          entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross
          the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an
          elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES:

          MANAGER
          Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I
          understand you're in a hurry, why don't I
          show you to your box.

          JERRY
          (WHAT THE FUCK?! then:)
          yes, thank you, we'd... like that.
          The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a
          THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly,
          waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of
          light, identifying him as: "SAXON, CARL." Jerry's eyes: this is
          madness. The elevator doors OPEN.

          INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY

          They exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX.
          He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle
          Eastern Man gave Jerry:

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 53.

          CONTINUED:

          MANAGER
          Your key?
          Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box
          slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to
          give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box.

          RACHEL
          You gonna open it?

          JERRY
          Maybe it's not gonna be so bad.

          RACHEL
          Yeah... maybe it's something good..
          They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO
          GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of
          the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: "EAR:MIC. NOW."

           JERRY RACHEL
          Oh, shit -- it's bad --
          They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear:

          WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC
          Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In
          sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the
          adjacent vault carrying a briefcase.
          Take it -- by force if necessary -- then
          exit the building..
          Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know:

          RACHEL
          -- what?!

          JERRY
          -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier
          way to`get whatever the hell it is you
          want -- is there? Miss?
          But she's not answering.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Excellent.

          RACHEL
          What now -- what are we?

          BUT THE VAULT NEXT DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS--

          JERRY RACHEL
          -- they're coming--we're
          supposed to rob them -- -- are you kidding me?!?!
          (hands her a GUN)
          -- just take i t-- -- no! Jesus! I don't even
          let Kyle play with water guns!
          -- hey, I applaud your
          parenting skills -- take it!
          The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS
          COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC
          BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist -- the other spots Jerry's gun and
          REACTS, going for his gun:

          JERRY
          Don't!
          The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly --

           JERRY (CONT'D)
          Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the
           floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna
           hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just --
          we need the case.

          COURIER #1
          You're bringing a shitstorm on your
          heads, you know that.

          JERRY
          I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do
          it.
          The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a
          combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his
          wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it... AND
          COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE -- SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun
          out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC
          falling out of his ear... he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under
          the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance:
          snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator --
          Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps
          up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel
          table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up
          GUN from his ankle -- brings the barrel up as:
          BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the
          gun that was kicked across the floor:

          RACHEL

          DROP THE GUN ASSHOLE!
          Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip.
          Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother.

          Gimme the case. Now.
          They do -- and Jerry and Rachel back into the elevator with it.

          JERRY RACHEL
          impressive. Thanks.
          The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO:

          INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - ELEVATOR - DAY

          Alone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline
          coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle:

          "01:12:36. 01:12:35."

           RACHEL JERRY
          -- whoa--what is that? -- a timer
          -- it's counting down-- -- they do.that --
          what's it mean?! -- I dunno, the only things
           with timers I can think of are
           microwaves and...
          -- and bombs, you were gonna
          say bombs --
           some coffee makers have
           timers.. .and egg timers...
          -- yeah, Jerry, it's an egg
          timer -- What is SHE saying
          about it --? I dunno, I --
          -- What do you mean you. don't
          know?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not
          optimum.
          JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:

          JERRY
          Would you stop doing that?!

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          There will thirty five seconds of
          disconnect, during which you need to get
          yourselves across the street to the
          stadium's VIP parking area unexposed.

          JERRY
          (calling out)
          Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking
          out with a bomb! Hey! You!
          But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN--

          TWO MORE BRINKS COURIERS wait by an armored truck. Jerry and
          Rachel exit, trying to look casual. Hearts POUNDING --

          RACHEL
          How do I look?

          JERRY
          Like you got into a fight. Me?

          RACHEL
          Like you lost one.
          AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel
          walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the
          stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR.
          SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing
          their weapons. Rachel tensing.

          JERRY
          Just keep walking
          Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his
          shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR.
          Trying to stay calm.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Two jerseys and two hats, please --

          VENDOR
          Peyton or Vinatieri?

          Uh... both.
          The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT
          JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING
          TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel--

          They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium.
          Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they
          didn't pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a stop. Jerry,
          sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2..

          WHEN WHAM! THE STADIUM DOORS FLY OPEN AS THOUSANDS OF JOYOUS

          COLTS FANS POUR OUT WEARING IDENTICAL BLUE HATS AND JERSEYS.
          The game's over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel are lost
          in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them.
          Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them --
          Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards
          the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees
          them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door --

          CHAUFFEUR
          Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the
          game.

          JERRY
          Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry --

          CHAUFFEUR
          I bet.
          Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he
          closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops
          and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we
          reveal, etched across the rear: "JUST MARRIED."

          EXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY

          Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing
          madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY
          they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly
          as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each
          as tall and broad as the next --

          LATESHA
          (looking UP at them all)
          Afternoon... afternoon, sir...
          afternoon... afternoon, General...
          Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by
          ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders.

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          Secretary Callister?
          He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID:

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I
          need to ask you a question, sir --

          CALLISTER
          Not now, you can direct it to my office.

          LATESHA
          It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty
          seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it
          is? 'Cause its not --

          CALLISTER
          -- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms,
          and I don't have thirty seconds.

          LATESHA
          So should I assume it has something to. do
          with the four CVN class 21 aircraft
          carriers you and the president just
          ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -?
          He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--?

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          I just checked the intel, sir, we have
          some of the same indexes --

          CALLISTER
          You need to stop assuming.
          And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling
          like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS:

          LATESHA
          Secretary Callister.
          Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by
          the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the
          GENERALS, planting herself in front of him:

          LATESHA (CONT'D)
          My Department's tracking a home-grown
          terrorist on the loose as we speak who
          may be connected to a cell with ties
          inside this building. Now seeing as you
          just had a meeting back there with more
          brass than the Navy Marching Band and
          with the terror threat rising every three
          hours, I'm going to just have to assume
          you're in the middle of a very delicate
          dance to stave off World War Three... so
          with all due respect, you either give me
          my thirty seconds and tell me what the
          hell B-36 is, or this world just fell
          into an even bigger heap of trouble.
          Sir.
          Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit
          a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO:

          obsequious BELLHOP approaches -- he's been waiting for them:

          BELLHOP
          Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? This way, please --
          Tries to take the BRIEFCASE from Jerry, who yanks it back:

          JERRY
          No! 2 trot it.
          (forces a smile)
          Thanks, though.

          INT. PENTAGON - ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY

          Latesha dumps her things on a tray, moves through a scanner --
          among her items is a set of KEYS with aMINI.SWISS ARMY KNIFE.
          She's handed a NEW BADGE that reads: "TEMPORARY ACCESS."
          Ahead, an elevator door OPENS and we start CROSS CUTTING:

          INT. ELEVATOR - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS

          Jerry, Rachel, and the bellhop step in. The Hop hits
          "Penthouse." MUZAK. They travel up:

          BELLHOP
          So, where'd you two get hitched?

          JERRY RACHEL
          Reno. Niagara Falls.
          Shit.

          JERRY RACHEL
          Niagara Falls. Reno.
          Shit. The "DING" of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO:

          INT. PENTAGON ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

          THE LEVEL INDICATOR, having just arrived at floor "B-35."
          Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously
          as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing:
          A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the
          scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked "B-
          36." It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon.
          The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing:

          INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS

          12-foot concrete walls. High-tech ventilation and surveillance
          system. Standing there waiting is SCOTT BOWMAN, early thirties,
          hasn't seen daylight in a while:

          SCOTT
          Agent Simms? Scott Bowman: Welcome to B-
          36. If you'll follow me?

          INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS

          The Bellhop dramatically opens the door --

          BELLHOP
          Welcome to paradise.
          Palatial HONEYMOON SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the
          bed...

          BELLHOP (CONT'D)
          Minibar, high-speed internet, thousand-
          count sheets. And if you're looking for
          the TV
          He clicks a remote and a 72" PLASMA TV rises up from a cabinet.
          On screen, a narrated "virtual tour".of the hotel:

          TV VOICE
          dedicated to the highest standards of
          luxury and comfort...

          BELLHOP
          Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with
          eighteen nozzles that hit in all the
          right places, if you'll pardon my French.
          .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here
          t2. serve, I'm here to please...
          And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still
          looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry
          digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS.

          JERRY
          Knock yourself out.
          The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS
          THE DOOR on him.

          RACHEL
          This is nice and everything, but what the
          hell are we doing here?

          JERRY
          Nice? One night in this place is more
          than one of my paychecks; and that's
          before taxes --
          He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it,
          pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol...

          RACHEL
          What're you doing?

          JERRY
          If we're going down, I'm gonna go down
          singing. Hey! Chocolate covered
          almonds, I love these!

          RACHEL
          Can you stop eating for a second?
          A KNOCK at the door and they stop arguing immediately.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Answer it.
          They TURN hearing the voice: it's.coming from the T.V. The FOUR
          SEASONS GRAPHIC still dancing on screen.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          There are items you will need for the
          next step.
          KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the
          door. A DELIVERY BOY stands there with a BAG:

          DELIVERY BOY
          There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day?
          Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just
          as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things
          from the bag: hair. dye, clothes...

          WOMAN'S VOICE
           The limousine is waiting for you
          `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to
          change your appearance.

          RACHEL

          JERRY
          What the hell's in the briefcase?

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Your only consideration at present is to
          deliver it before the timer expires.

          He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV snaps to BLACK -- then

          computer-controlled network. And now:

          It stands for 'Autonomous Reconnaissance

          And we reveal "THE TANK." A glassed-in wall containing TONS of
          water. AN AWESOME STEEL SPHERE IN THE WATER, suspended by a
          claw-like apparatus. The "brain" of a com uter network. The
          very same image Jerry and Rachel just saw on the TV.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Twenty-two hundred tons of super-cooled
          water keeps her from overheating --
          that's ninety-two thousand processors,
          the equivalent of a hundred.millionhuman
          brains working together as:,.one..."'

          LATESHA
          (in awe)
          an electronic espionage system.

          No, that was Echelon, eavesdropping off
          satellites. This goes.;. much farther.

          chasing someone with a suitcase nuke in
          L.A., we can order Aria to shut down mass
          transit, track the perp through traffic
          cameras... and if given the order, she
          could even turn a TV into a bomb to take

          desertion is punishable by death.

          Latesha returns to the NETWORK MONITORING HUB to find Scott

          Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW exiting the mainframe
          tank, moving down corridors, getting in the elevator. Weird to
          see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same walk.

          Then... her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel.
          Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera.

           ON THE FEED: the elevator door OPENS and Paul steps out. That's

          They turn a corner... and STOP DEAD:-
          A FIRE EXTINGUISHER is mounted on the wall.
          Latesha sees the placement of the CAMERAS caddy-corner to the

          for something, anything... but finds NOTHING.

          Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a
          cocktail napkin... RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful
          rendering. And we sense something in his look too--
          something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start --

          Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said.
          It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow... kinder...

          RACHEL (CONT'D)

          You have to understand, I wasn't his
          twin, I was more like his... little
          brother. Always trying to catch up. And
          you wouldn't believe how... nice he was
          to me. Teaching me things when we were
          kids, telling me how great I was. He was
          the only one who ever did.
          (almost smiles)
          Of course he was involved in some super
          secret National Security project. He was
          a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to
          his back. I'm the fuck-up.

          They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic
          shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his
          eye -- his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign:
          "DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT." The driver's.tinted divider

          I have more to lose in this. If anything
          happens to Kyle then my life's over
          anyway --
          But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case.

          Rachel -- til we met, I had nothing to
          lose. We do this together.
          A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it.

          INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          We FEEL the heightened state of alert. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN with
          M-16's scan the crowd. Jerry and Rachel enter, adrenaline
          pumping -- he opens the envelope to reveal two PASSPORTS with
          their photos, but the names "MARK and ALLISON ACKERMAN." JUST
          THEN Aria's VOICE comes over the P.A.:

          ARIA OVER P.A.
          Allison Ackerman, please pick up the
          white courtesy phone --
          They stop, hearing her. Rachel TENSES in this moment moves
          to the RINGING courtesy phone, answers:

          ARIA (V.0.)
          Go to the ticketing machine, you'll
          receive two tickets to Paris.

          RACHEL
          -- Paris?

          ARIA (V.0.)
          Once you have the tickets, walk to gate
          17-C. Move quickly.

          EXT. DAYTON INTERNATIONALAIRPORT - TARMAC - CONTINUOUS

          A chopper TOUCHES DOWN near a waiting contingent of AGENTS and
          AIRPORT PD -- Morgan and Grant hop out on the MOVE, handing out
          BLURRY VIDEO STILLS from the 7-11:

          MORGAN
          He's with a brunette female,
          approximately five-seven -- I want
          airport PD at all exits -- have the tower

          here under Federal jurisdiction but don't
          change the departure boards, I don't want
          'em to know we're coming--
          The agents enter the airport through a door on the tarmac --

          INT. CARRY-ON SCREENING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          Jerry and Rachel show their tickets and ID's to a TSA SCREENER,
          watching all the people on the X-ray line... families... kids...
          Jerry looks down at the case that could kill them all...

          SECURITY ATTENDANT
          Sir, you'll have to put that through.
          Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off
          their shoes... watch the case move toward the mouth of the
          machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a
          GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN... the briefcase glides into view...
          A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes
          revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They
          notice the surveillance cam watching:

          RACHEL
          (a murmur)
          she changed the screen...
          The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back:

          Can't be too careful.

          JERRY
          (forces a smile)
          You're doing a great job.
          As they walk on, he checks the timer, 00:03:22... 00:03:21.. 11
          They pass a KIDS' BAND and their teacher, gathered around an
          airline CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK.

          As Morgan races forward, ARIA ACTS: the X-ray screen FRITZES
          again as another carry-on goes through, revealing its "contents"
          as a HAND GUN AND KNIVES! The TSA agent hits a RED BUTTON --

          And in a nanosecond, all TSA AGENTS draw guns and throw a KOREAN
          MAN against the wall -- he SHOUTS in confusion as they tear open
          his bag to reveal... it's filled with BIBLES!

          MORGAN

          MOVE! EVERYBODY MOVE! FEDERAL OFFICER!
          MOVING WITH JERRY AND RACHEL -- past a wall made of THIRTY FLAT
          SCREEN MONITORS that form one massive NIKE ad of Lebron slam
          dunking -- at once, the screens CHANGE to spell out the words:

          GATE 17-C. THEY'RE THIRTEEN SECONDS BEHIND YOU.
          Jerry and Rachel streak towards 17-C as the screens RETURN TO
          NORMAL when Morgan and agents follow with pistols swinging --
          INTERCUT SURVEILLANCE CAM POV: as Jerry and Rachel hurtle past
          an ATM MACHINE, IT SPITS OUT A CASH CLOUD..THAT"INCITES A FEEDING
          FRENZY -- agents SLAM into commuters and topple --

          MORGAN REACTS TO WHAT HE SEES -- HOW'D THAT JUST HAPPEN?
          Agent Grant and airport cops round the corner ahead -- our
          heroes veer past a FLASHING MESSAGE BOARD that changes:

          GET ON THE SLIDEWALK.
          They leap onto the SLIDEWALK which starts ACCELERATING as they
          run -- travellers gawk as Jerry and Rachel race by -- they reach
          the end but are going so fast.that they're JETTISONED off the
          conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers.
          Agents run onto the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING
          them off their feet -- they're LAUNCHED into the air, a domino-
          effect of crashing people.` Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up
          and run toward gate 17-C, another screen CHANGES:

          TAKE THE EMERGENCY EXIT.
          Above a door, the "EXIT" sign FLASHES UNNATURALLY -- the door
          automatically UNLOCKS -- they push through -- Morgan runs up,
          too late; the door's shut again. Sees an AIRPORT JANITOR --

          MORGAN (CONT'D)
          Open this NOW!
          The janitor quickly swipes his ID through the keycard scanner,
          but it BUZZES RED. Aria's locking them out. Morgan FIRES his
          gun at the lock -- people SCREAM as he slams through --

          INT. LUGGAGE CONVEYOR AREA - CONTINUOUS

          As Jerry and Rachel run through different tracks of LUGGAGE
          CONVEYOR BELTS, GUNSHOTS ping above them -- its Morgan -- they
          tumble, landing half-on, half-off a conveyor below.

          JERRY LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE BRIEFCASE! It FALLS, landing on a
          "return" belt, Jerry reaches but MISSES by inches --
          THE BRIEFCASE travels onward, nearing Morgan -- he GOES for it --
          but a machine arm guiding luggage SWINGS LEFT, manipulated by
          Aria -- KNOCKS Morgan back before he can grab the case--

           RACHEL SNAGS IT -- HER POV -- TIMER: "00:01:10... 00:01:09..."
          As Jerry scrambles to her, the conveyor SHIFTS THEM to a
          different belt -- they're funneled through a HATCHWAY. Dazed by
          what he's just seen, Morgan scrambles for his walkie:

          MORGAN
          All agents: northwest cargo area!
          FREIGHT CARGO AREA: separated from Morgan, they tumble off the
          conveyor -- a plasma displays the "Asset Tracking System," all
          airport cargo and shipping -- it CHANGES to read:

          ROW 18. FIND CRATE MARKED "FRAGILE.
          They run for Row 18, find a crate with "FRAGILE" in BOLD RED --
          an ELECTRONIC LOCK on the crate descrambles -- the front of the
          crate falls OPEN... oddly, the interior's padded with THICK
          INSULATED LINING, a NEXTEL WALKIE PHONE inside blips:

          simply UNLOCKS.. They exhale.

           ARIA OVER THE WALKIE (V.0.)
          open it.
          Hand still trembling, Jerry reaches out... lifts the top to
          reveal... TWO HYPODERMIC SYRINGE INJECTORS and two vials of
          CLEAR LIQUID labelled: "Cryozine I TEST VIALS -- 20 x 1.0 ml.

          Climb inside the cargo container.
          They duck into the crate, pulling the front back up into place.

          JERRY
          I've never done 'em in a cargo container.
          Despite everything, she smiles at that. He reaches for the

          INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL. AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

          It's ABSOLUTE CHAOS from all the grounded flights. Morgan,

          strides through the airport with Grant:

          AGENT GRANT
          Halloway-Smith says the drug was
          experimental -- briefcase was on a time-
          lock to prevent corporate espionage,
          supposed to be delivered to one of their

          He's cut short by the sound of ROARING TURBINES out the window
          they spin to see the C-130 taxiing down the runway...

          INT. PENTAGON - MAINTENANCE AREA - DAY

          DEAFENING NOISE: blow torches, steam pipes, radios, and a huge
          CRUSHING SOUND coming from an INDUSTRIAL TRASH COMPACTOR as
          Pentagon detritus gets recycled.
          Latesha and Scott hurry in -- MOVING through quickly -- scanning
          -- when they SEE it: a forklift whirring towards the. compactor
          carrying a huge bin filled with old fire extinguishers.
          Hundreds of them, stem valves removed, ready to be.dumped.
          Scott and Latesha break into a RUN, skittering down stairs to
          the main floor. Running towards the forklift, waving wildly:

          LATESHA SCOTT
          Stop!! STOP! STOP!!
          But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange
          EARPLUGS in his ears. Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the
          compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and
          Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor
          rumbling down to flatten everything'-
          The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave
          their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just
          three feet shy of crushing everything.

          LATESHA
          We have to look in there!
          Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor

          COMPACTOR OPERATOR
          Lady, you can't do that!

          LATESHA
          The hell I can't! Come on!
          Shit. Scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in,
          ducking low, the ARM frozen just feet above them. The
          compactor's foul, inches of industrial grease and crap and God-
          knows-what. They start wading through the extinguishers,
          turning them over, shaking them, looking inside--

          WHEN THE ARM. Moves. Just a fraction. The operator looks at
          the console: the hell? Latesha and Scott keep ploughing through
          the tanks as... THE ARM MOVES AGAIN. And this time Latesha
          heard it. Looks up. AND IT MOVES AGAIN. And now she sees the
          ubiquitous CAMERAS watching... ARIA...
          THE ARM STARTS COMING DOWN! Scott CRIES OUT! Grabs Latesha by
          the jacket and tumbles out of the COMPACTOR but not before
          Latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches back--

          SCOTT
          Latesha!
          -- grabbing the extinguisher as CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as
          she snaps her hand back just in time. Turns the tank over and
          palms something, unnoticed by everyone.
          As the operator runs up to her, beside himself --

          OPERATOR
          I don't know what happened! It wouldn't
          stop!
          Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her.

          SCOTT
          -- you okay? Jesus
          (but her eyes are LOCKED
          on the Cameras)
          Latesha?

          LATESHA
          yeah. I need to get out of here.

          SCOTT
          Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on --
          As they start walking out. Workers parting to let them through.
          As they head towards the exit, Latesha suddenly pulls Scott into

          THE--
          BATHROOM: slams the door and locks it.

          LATESHA
           Your girlfriend can't see us in here --
          Gimme your phone --

           SCOTT

           (STUNNED)
           What --?! My phone? What're you --
           When Latesha opens her hand and Scott sees a CELL SIM CARD:

           LATESHA
           He hid it under the valve. This is what

          INT. ASHLAND & SONS JEWELRY STORE - MORNING

          MAGNIFIED through a jeweler's monocle, a diamond.., as it comes
          into FOCUS, we realize it's actually one of the HEX CRYSTALS
          Aria maneuvered off the military test site. CAMERA MOVES around
          the JEWELER, revealing FOUR MORE crystals on his workbench.
          Behind him, a sign: ASHLAND & SONS. Says into a phone headset:

          JEWELER
          Unique stones, where're they from?
          And in response, ARIA -- ultra-friendly, so human it's chilling:

          ARIA ON PHONE (V.0..)
          Family heirlooms. Sorry for the rush but
          I really want my son to be able to give
          them to his fiancee at their her
          engagement party tonight.

          JEWELER
          Lucky girl. I think I have the perfect
          setting. She'll love it.

          ARIA ON PHONE
          Thank you for understanding. You know
          how mothers are, well do just about
          anything...

          AGENT GRANT'S VOICE
          A shipment from D.O.D.'s ghost fleet went
          missing --

          EXT. SKIES ABOVE WASHINGTON - DUSK

          A HELICOPTER ERUPTS INTO VIEW, barreling toward THE PENTAGON.
          Up front beside the pilot is Morgan; Grant filling him in:

          AGENT GRANT
          -- they were moving experimental
          explosives from a testing facility in
          Aberdeen.

          MORGAN
          What do you mean, 'experimental?'

          AGENT GRANT
          Compound called 'Hex' -- some kinda weird
          crystals that detonate with a sonic
          trigger -- it disappeared too, few days
          ago.

          One crystal to a football field --

          MORGAN
          You mean one Goddamned crystal that
          someone could put in their pocket?!
          (pulls off glasses)
          This is not good. This is not a
          coincidence. What about a trace?

          AGENT GRANT
          Computer log shows the diverted Hex was
          sent to an address in Virginia,.jewelry,
          shop called 'Ashland And Sons' - care
          of Jerry Shaw.
          Morgan puts his glasses back on and looks hard at Grant. Opens
          his mouth to give and order when--

          AGENT GRANT (CONT'D)
          (cutting him off)
          -- I'm all over it. ''.
          Grant finally coming to his own when they're suddenly cut off by
          two ARMY BLACKHAWK CHOPPERS, door gunners at the ready:

          BLACKHAWK PILOT (V.0.)
          (over squawk box)
          Helo flight VY84X, you're in restricted
          US Military Airspace. Identify.

          Blackhawk flight, we're on a DHS pri-one
          mission to the Pentagon heliport. FAA
          will confirm, over.
          Morgan just wants to get the fuck down there -- finally:

          BLACKHAWK PILOT (V.0.)
          Roger, FAA confirms. We'll lead you in.
          As the Blackhawks dip toward the Pentagon, the pilot follows:

          CHOPPER PILOT
          (to Morgan)
          Sorry. State of the Union tonight,
          they're locking up the city.

          I think I know where we are...
          She sees it now too -- a FIRE:SCHEMATIC of emergency exits. The

          Callister looks at Scott, at the sweat on his face. At the

          cameras in Aria's control hub, so we
          weren'.t able to know why... he knew that,

          Jerry scrambles back as it cartwheels into the air and the

          Rachel's led by the Senate Page through the Speaker's Lobby
          entrance onto the house floor, passing a SECRET SERVICE AGENT
          watching every face with laser eyes...

          The PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE nears the Capitol. His limo's lead by
          Motorcycle Cops, headlights FLASHING, Secret Service...

          INT. PENTAGON - COOLING ROOM - NIGHT

          Aria's temperature gauges are rising into red-line:

          SCOTT
          One more degree
          SUDDENLY the door bursts open and two GUARDS rush in with guns,
          SLAM them to the wall:

          GUARD #1

          FREEZE! HANDS! STEP AWAY FROM THE

          CONSOLE!

           LATESHA SCOTT
          -- WAIT WAIT WAIT -- -- my name's Scott Bowman, I
           have B-36 clearance, my ID's
           in my pocket --
           The guard pulls out his ID, checks it, keys a shoulder-walkie:

           GUARD #1 (CONT'D)
           Unit 5, suspects in custody, but they
           have clearance --
          The voice that responds over the walkie is ARIA'S:

          =ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.O.)
          Negative, credentials for Bowman and
          Simms have been revoked. Secure them in
          the mainframe tank, additional units en
          route to take custody --

          LATESHA GUARDS
          -- that's not a person, it's -- shut up
          the computer, she's -- BE QUIET

          MALFUNCTIONING-'--
          They're pushed into --

          INT. PENTAGON - MAINFRAME TANK - DAY

          The water in Aria's mainframe tank is BUBBLING as a graphic
          shows the temp MAXING OUT. The door behind them suddenly LOCKS.
          The guards REACT -- one punches in a code, no good.

          GUARD #2
          Control, maglocks just engaged in the
          south door, need and override... do you
          copy?

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 116.

          CONTINUED:
          An ALARM blares. Scott sees PRESSURE GAUGES fluctuating wildly:

          SCOTT
          -- oh shit... she's upping the water
          pressure --

          LATESHA
          -- what?!

          SCOTT
          She can't drain the tank... she's--gonna
          blow it.
          As the pressure in the tank intensifies, the frame begins to
          GROAN. The steel fitting SCREAMS with the enormous load -- a
          support rivet POPS OUT with an earsplitting KWANG! Zings across
          the room like a BULLET, pockmarking the wall.--

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          You gotta let me run a bypass on that
          door or in about 30 seconds this room's
          gonna be full of water!
          A fracture shoots across the glass. The guards are FRIGHTENED:

          GUARD #1`
          yeah, go, _ qo

          SCOTT

          I NEED SOMETHING TO PRY IT OPEN!
          Latesha whips out her keychain with the MINI ARMY KNIFE -- Scott
          pries off the panel:.as..the glass fracture GROWS -- he starts
          stripping wires as MORE'STEEL RIVETS pop loose, PING PING PING!
          It's like dodging bullets -- Scott SPARKS the wires together and
          the door starts to OPEN, but only a few inches before it STOPS.

          LATESHA
          Yoi.:can do it you can do it you can do
          it!

          SCOTT
          Stop telling me I can do it!
          The glass SPIDERWEBS MADLY -- he SPARKS the wires together
          again, the door opens a few more inches but:
          THE GLASS GIVES WAY AND THE TANK EXPLODES! WATER SURGES across
          the room, the guards are IMPALED by glass shards, Latesha and
          Scott SMASH HARD against the wall.., but the half-open door acts
          like a DRAIN, siphoning water into corridors...
          As the level lowers, we find Latesha and Scott on the ground,
          water runoff trailing around them, unmoving...

          RACHEL
          no, thank you...
          He smiles and leaves her there. She looks all around her,
          fighting the paranoia. What the hell's coming next?

          LIGHT mottled through trees, reflects off the windshield.
          Driving, Rachel stares thoughtfully at the road. The music's
          coming from the radio. She glances over:
          KYLE sits beside her, hand out the window, dipping up and down
          against the countryside. She watches him, filled with love.

          MAN'S VOICE (PRE-LAP)

          It seems right before you destroyed her,
          she attempted to fragment her core and
          uplink to a public satellite network...
          did you see anything to corroborate that?

          LATESHA
          (glances at Scott)
          What... do you mean?

          DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          She tried to break herself into bits and
          download them into cyberspace... we

          She turns to see JERRY standing there. He's still got his
          scratches, arm in a SLING. It's the only real injury we can see
          and it'll heal. Kyle runs up to him and throwing his arms
          around his waist.

          JERRY
          Hey, little man!

          Sorry I'm late, this was hard to find --

          Kyle. What do you say?

          KYLE
          I dunno, I haven't opened it yet.

          Who brought you up?

          It's like everyone else at the party has disappeared...

          of a CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW COMMITTEE --

          NEWS ANCHOR
          sources inside the beltway say the

          Oblivious, Kyle flips on the video game and the screen CHANGES
          to the Playstation logo. The kids CHEER, they can't wait... but
          the screen fritzes and goes BLANK...

          FRIENDS
          Aw, what the hell?! It's broken!
          A prompt appears with a BLINKING CURSOR. Then... words scroll:

          "HELLO, KYLE..."
          The kids look at him, confused. Kind of freaked out. Kyle
          stares at the screen, eyes riveted, his breathing quickens.
          CLOSE: THE CURSOR -- blinking like a beating heart and we:

          SLAM TO BLACK.

1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1

    It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The
    scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.
    A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish
    newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional
    barber's shop called Ozim's.

2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2

    The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)
    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).
    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit
    beneath the barber's gown.

    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and
    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.

    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks
    with a Russian accent.

                           OZIM
              Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody
              kids, you know... he says - `but
              Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas!
              We're Islam!

                          SOYKA
              Oi, how much are you taking off?

                          OZIM
              Christmas! So I said to him...
              alisverise cimac. The kid's
              sixteen...

    Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and
    Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet
    near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.

                          OZIM (CONT'D)
              They don't want to work do they.
              Shicma....

                          EKREM
                  (hesitantly
                   interrupting)
              Uncle Ozim.......

    We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear
    as well as cold.

                                OZIM
                 This is him.     The kid I'm talking
                 about.

    Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem
    in the mirror.

                             SOYKA
                 He looks OK to me... how you doin'
                 Ekrem?

    Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it
    as if it were enchanted...

                             OZIM
                 He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do
                 one lousy thing for me. Here,
                 look... Ekrem, take this...

    Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic
    bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally
    terrified.

                             EKREM
                 Ozim... memnum etmek.

                             OZIM
                 We had a deal now he's backing
                 out.

                             SOYKA
                     (laughing)
                 Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone.
                 It's obviously a psychological
                 thing...

                             OZIM
                 Take it Ekrem.

                             SOYKA
                 Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave.

                             OZIM
                 This is the kid who walks around
                 like Al Capone. Take the fucking
                 ustura and finish this Rushca.

                             SOYKA
                     (startled)
                 What?

    Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's
    gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open
    the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream
    bubbles in the blood.

3   EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT                                 3

    We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off
    in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We
    pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are
    hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)
    hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown
    with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair
    is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.
    She is barefoot.

4   INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT                                    4

    The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER.
    Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the
    customer react to her ragged appearance.

                          TATIANA
                  (Russian accent)
              Please... I have...

                          CHEMIST
              For methadone I need to see paper
              prescription.

    The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see
    blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then
    faints onto the floor.

5   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT                5

    We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting
    through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar
    hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a
    JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two
    PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.

                          ANNA
              Did you get a name?

                             PARAMEDIC
              No.

6   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT                6

    A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse.
    Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The
    theater is full of people in scrubs, including an
    anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double
    speed.

    We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering
    needle marks.

    A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and
    we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....

                             NURSE 1
                 Her stats are very poor, very poor.
                 Baby's very distressed.

    Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the
    contents of the bag. We see a business card from a
    restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher
    necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.

                             JUNIOR DOCTOR
                 Shoulder distocia, I think.   Stuck
                 on the pubic bone.

    Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head.    Anna strokes her face and
    speaks softly.

                             ANNA
                 Darling... darling, can you hear
                 me?

                             NURSE
                 Baby's heart beat sixty... fifty-
                 eight, fifty-eight... fifty-seven...

                             JUNIOR DOCTOR
                 Anna, I'm trying to rotate the
                 shoulder medially... shit...

    THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter
    panic as he attempts to free the baby.

    The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid
    thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters...

                             NURSE 2
                 I'm not getting a pulse.

    Heartbeats. Doctor Aziz joins the junior doctor, who looks
    out of his depth.

                             AZIZ
                 Speak to me...

    Before the junior doctor can speak Anna speaks directly to
    Aziz.

                              ANNA
                     (softly)
                 We need to get the baby out now.

    Aziz knows he can take Anna's word...

                             AZIZ
                 OK, let's go.

    All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at
    frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious
    face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice
    speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between
    nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.

                             TATIANA (V.O.)
                 My name is Tatiana. My father
                 died in the mines in my village,
                 so he was already buried when he
                 died. We were all buried there.
                 Buried under the soil of Russia.
                 That is why I left to find a better
                 life.

    We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed
    shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.

                             ANNA
                     (whispers)
                 You had a girl.

    A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the
    screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her
    bloody wrist.

    in unison...

7   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. LABOR WARD - MORNING                 7

    Anna leaves the labor ward, putting on her crash helmet.
    She emerges out into the crisp, sunny morning. Aziz hurries
    to catch her up and hands her a wrapped gift.

                            AZIZ
                Merry Christmas, Anna.

                            ANNA
                Oh, don't be ridiculous.

    He grins.

                            AZIZ
                And you have to open it in front
                of me.

    Aziz smiles as Anna unwraps a pair of leather motorcycling
    gloves. She looks up at him, expressionless.

                            AZIZ (CONT'D)
                At least pretend.

    Anna considers the gloves.

                In the whole entire history of my

                special.

                Thank you.

    Aziz plants a kiss on his two fingers and presses his
    fingers against Anna's cheek through the open visor of the

8   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                                         8

    Anna rides her big vintage URAL motorcycle through deserted
    morning streets. As she rides, we hear Tatiana in V.O.

                             TATIANA (V.O.)
                 I am so excited this morning.
                 Yesterday a friend came back to
                 our village and he told us all
                 about the places on the map that I
                 look at... Paris, Amsterdam, London.
                 He's been there for real...

9   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - DAY                         9

    After the bright airiness of the bike ride, we are suddenly
    in Anna's bedroom where the curtains are drawn. Anna is
    lying awake on the bed, wearing a dressing gown.

                             TATIANA (V.O.)
                 ...he said the future of everything
                 was already happening in all those
                 places.

    There is a gentle knock at the door, which opens before
    Anna can respond. It is ANNA'S MOTHER (HELEN) with a cup
    of tea.

                             HELEN
                 Did you sleep?

                 There's no point us tiptoeing around
                 if you're not even sleeping.

    Helen puts the tea on the dressing table, then turns to
    leave without a smile.

                                  ANNA
                 Mum?       Are you OK?

10   INT.   HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                             10

     Anna is pouring two glasses of sherry. Helen is peeling
     potatoes. Anna peers at Helen... and sees tears. They
     share a moment of stifled emotion. Helen wipes her eyes
     with her sleeve.

                              HELEN
                  It's the chicken.
                      (pause)
                  The smell of chicken roasting
                  reminds me of him.

                              ANNA
                  You should have done beef, then.

     They look at each other and giggle. They both have potato
     peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical
     unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave
     of emotion.

                              HELEN
                  It wouldn't be Christmas without
                  tears in the gravy, would it.

     We hear a gruff Russian voice calling out from the living
     room (UNCLE STEPAN).

                                STEPAN (V.O.)
                      (angry)
                  Anna! Anna!    Where did you get
                  this?

     Anna and Helen roll their eyes.

                              HELEN
                      (whispering)
                  It's your own fault for giving him
                  something to play with.

                              ANNA
                      (irritated)
                  Well, I can't read Russian, can I?

     Anna drops her peeler and hurries into the living room.

11   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY                           11

     The living room table is laid for dinner. Uncle Stepan is
     early seventies, Russian. He is reading the tiny diary
     that Anna found in Tatiana's bag. Anna breezes in.

                              ANNA
                  I told you, Uncle Stepan, I found
                  it in the handbag of a girl who
                  died in my ward.

                              STEPAN
                  Do you always rob the bodies of
                  the dead?

                              ANNA
                      (suppressed, familiar
                       anger)
                  Of course, we all do it. It's one
                  of the perks of working in a
                  hospital.

     Stepan grumbles, accustomed to this teasing.

     Helen enters carrying a bowl of walnuts and brazil nuts
     which she places on the table.

     Pause.   Stepan looks pointedly at Helen.

                              STEPAN
                  Did you know that your daughter
                  robs the bodies of the dead?

                              ANNA
                  Stepan, is there an address?

     Stepan lays the diary aside, obstinate and prim.

                              STEPAN
                  You have an uncle who doesn't steal
                  things from the dead. Not even
                  their secrets.

                              HELEN
                  Oh, don't go all momentous on us,
                  Stepan.
                      (she straightens
                       the table cloth)
                  Lift your elbows.

                              STEPAN
                  You should put this in her coffin,
                  Anna. Bury her secrets with her
                  bodies.

                               ANNA
                  Body.   Singular.

     Stepan leaves in a huff. Anna picks up the diary and begins
     to study it. She sees the `Trans-Siberian' business card
     between the pages.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  How long will dinner be?

     Helen looks at Anna, suspecting an attempt to escape.

12   EXT. LONDON STREETS - DAY                                       12

     Driving music as we see Anna riding her motorbike through
     deserted morning streets again. We should begin to sense
     that this is a kind of release for her. We hear Tatiana
     in V.O.

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  When I was little, London was like
                  a place in the Bible. I wasn't
                  even sure if it was real. My friend
                  has told me there is a place in
                  London where they pay girls to
                  sing.

     Anna arrives outside the `Trans-Siberian' restaurant. It
     has a Russian-themed frontage in blue and gold, expensively
     and recently finished.

                              TATIANA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  He said if I sang in this restaurant
                  I would make more money in a week
                  than my father made in a year.

     As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark.

13   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY               13

     The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome
     Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back
     from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges
     into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a
     fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of
     a chain.

     Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger,
     slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in
     a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy
     night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill
     yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian
     curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.

                              KIRILL
                  So you pick up Ozim and his bitch
                  of a wife and you bring them back
                  here.

     He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Then I'll think of an excuse and
                  we can get away.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I'll think of an excuse. Your
                  excuses are like fucking fairy
                  tales.

     Kirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys.
     The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response.
     Kirill notices Anna locking up her bike at the front of
     the restaurant.

                              KIRILL
                  Who the fuck's that?

     They both see Anna removing her crash helmet and shaking
     out her hair. She walks towards the front door.

                              NIKOLAI
                      (in Russian)
                  Maybe somebody sent your dad a
                  hooker for Christmas.

                              KIRILL
                      (grinning)
                  You're so... fucking unbelievably
                  disrespectful.

     Kirill sees that Nikolai is studying Anna and his grin
     fades. We sense jealousy.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Hey, you've got work to do.   Go...

     Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a
     playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than
     playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car.

     Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the
     restaurant.

14   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                              14

     As Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the
     front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again
     when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his
     late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel,
     dressed in a spotlessly white apron. He has the sparkling
     piercing eyes of a falcon.

                              SEMYON
                  We are closed.

                                ANNA
                  I know.

     She fumbles in her bag.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Sorry... I'm a midwife.

     Anna produces her hospital ID and shows it to Semyon.

                  keeping something from me, you
                  have the wrong address.

                              ANNA
                  I'd like to speak to the Manager.

     Semyon studies the name on the ID.

                              SEMYON
                  Khitrova?

     Semyon seems suddenly delighted.

                              SEMYON
                  And his name?

                              ANNA
                  Ivan.

                              SEMYON
                  So, you are Anna Ivanovna.

     The tables are set for a huge party. Kirill is now on
     step ladders, fixing some Christmas decorations. Other
     relatives are getting the place ready. Semyon hurries
     through the restaurant, leading Anna by the hand.

                               SEMYON
                  We must hurry. I must stir. Stir,
                  stir or the gravy dies in my hands.
                  Today it is family. Here is my
                  son, Kirill.
                      (he hisses at Kirill)
                  Kirill! The berries are too low,
                  too low. And Roman, more glasses
                  for red!
                      (he claps his hands)
                  Come on!

     Kirill follows Anna's progress through the restaurant with
     a glare.

     and puts his hands on his hips.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               My angels. You should be
               practising. You must make the
               wood cry. Like this, like this...

     Semyon grabs a violin and plays a three-second burst of
     sad Russian violin music.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
               You see...

     Semyon hurries on into the kitchen.    Anna smiles, delighted
     at the eccentric old man.

16   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                   16

     Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam,
     smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits,
     others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots,
     laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost
     smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all,
     overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas
     kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone.

                           SEMYON
               Come, come, hurry, hurry.    They
               will be here any moment.
                   (to Anna)
               Ok, show me this card.

     Anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `Trans-
     Siberian' business card she found in Tatiana's bag. Semyon
     angles his head to look as he stirs.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               It is the old card. From before
               the renovations. But even so, if
               she had worked here I would remember
               the name. Perhaps she ate here
               once. Try this.

     Semyon offers Anna a spoonful of his gravy.    She sips it.

                           ANNA
               God, that's amazing. My dad made
               gravy just like that.

     Semyon shrugs and smiles, his eyes twinkling, then goes
     back to stirring. He speaks as if unconcerned.

                              SEMYON
                  So did you get a chance to talk to
                  this girl before she died?

     Nikolai's black Mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant
     and parks a few inches from Anna's motorbike. The rear
     windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the
     driver's seat.   He gets out of the car and opens the rear
     door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in
     her fifties. Nikolai goes to the other rear door. The
     portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges. As Ozim gets out
     he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note.

     Two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling
     each other's hair. The third is sobbing, sitting on the
     floor. A young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge
     silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen.

     Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place.
     Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap
     of paper.

                              SEMYON
                  This is an agency that hires casual
                  kitchen staff. Maybe you will
                  have more luck there. But I think
                  they will be closed until New Year.

     As Anna takes the address, Kirill puts his head around
     the door and yells through the noise.

                              KIRILL
                  Papa, Ozim is here.

     Semyon is alarmed and claps his hand in urgent fashion.

     Semyon takes a pot from the heat, suddenly flustered.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Anna, I'm so sorry I couldn't help.
                  It is sad.

                              ANNA
                  That's OK. I'll probably find out
                  more when I get her diary
                  translated.

                               SEMYON
                  Her diary?

     There is the tiniest of changes in Semyon's manner.        He
     lays his heavy pot down.

                              ANNA
                  I found her diary in her bag.

     A pause. Semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put
     a pan onto the heat then re-emerges.

                              SEMYON
                  Why did you not tell me you found
                  a diary?

     He peers at her for a moment, his eyes hardening a little.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  OK, Anna, this is how it will be.
                  You will bring the diary here and
                  I will translate it for you. Then
                  if we get the names of any relatives
                  I will call them myself. I am
                  something of a... community leader
                  for the Russians here in this
                  unfriendly city. What do you say?

     Semyon hoists a passing child into his arms.

                              ANNA
                  I was going to ask my uncle....

                              SEMYON

                       hearing)
                  And when you come I will make you
                  some more gravy like your papa
                  used to make and you can try the

               fish with the sauce. OK? Tomorrow,
               yes? Shall we say seven?

     Anna is a little overwhelmed.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               Then it is settled. But for now,
               you must forgive me.

     Semyon shrugs then kisses Anna on both cheeks.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               Dosvedania.

               Dosvedania.

     Anna heads for the door that leads back to the restaurant.
     Semyon goes back to stirring but as he stirs he calls out.

                           SEMYON
               Oh Anna, you always work at the
               Trafalgar hospital?

                              ANNA
               Yes, always.

     A pause before Anna leaves Semyon to his clouds of steam.

19   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                           19

     Kirill and Ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of
     Russian and Turkish whispers at a table. Ozim's wife is
     at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a
     cigarette and peeling glazed figs. As Anna walks by, Ozim
     and Kirill stop talking. The scene has a much darker mood
     to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna
     feels no unease. As she passes, Kirill surveys her with a
     deadly smile and a professional eye.

                              KIRILL
               Hey, you OK?     You want a drink?

                              ANNA
               No, thanks.     I'm driving.

     As Anna smiles, Ozim mumbles something in Turkish and Kirill
     shushes him.

     Ozim giggles.      Anna departs.

20   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                               20

     Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that
     four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various
     ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with
     their children are emerging from their cars. The women are
     all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear
     leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly
     as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels
     slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees
     Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking,
     still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's
     bike.

                              NIKOLAI
                      (in Russian)
                  Nice bike.

                                 ANNA
                  What?

                                 NIKOLAI
                  Nice bike.

                                 ANNA
                  Thank you.

                              NIKOLAI
                  A Ural. You don't see them anymore.

                              ANNA
                  It was my dad's.

                              NIKOLAI
                  How much do you want for it?

     Anna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is
     arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit
     and tattoos say it all.

                              ANNA
                      (irritated)
                  It has sentimental value.

     Nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers.

                  of that.

     Anna puts her helmet on.

               No.

                           NIKOLAI
               Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get
               invited. You want to go for a
               drink instead?

     Anna mounts her bike.

                           ANNA
               It's Christmas. Everything's
               closed.

     Nikolai smiles.

                           NIKOLAI
               Sometimes if things are closed you
               just open them up, you know?

     Anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first
     time. She rides away. Nikolai watches her go and then
     stubs his cigarette.

21   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                        21

     Sudden silence... perhaps the ticking of a clock. This is
     Anna's Christmas dinner, a total contrast to the chaos of
     the restaurant. Stepan is attempting to carve the chicken.

                           STEPAN
               Anna, how come is it that your
               boyfriend isn't here to carve?

     Stepan takes a large sip of vodka.

                           ANNA
               I don't live with Oliver any more,
               Uncle Stepan. I'm living back
               here for a bit.

                            HELEN
                   (softly)
               For as long as you want.

                           STEPAN
               I knew he would run away from you.

                  He didn't run away. You make me
                  sound like a burning building.

                              STEPAN
                  Black men always run away.

                               HELEN
                  Oh Stepan!

                               STEPAN
                  What?   I am allowed to be honest?

                              HELEN
                  He was a doctor, Stepan.

                  What the hell has that got to do
                  with it?

     A pause.     Stepan sips his vodka.

                              STEPAN
                  It is not natural to mix race and
                  race. That is why your baby died
                  inside you.

     Anna slams her napkin onto the table.

                               HELEN
                  Stepan, shut up!

                       feet)
                  Please Anna.

     Helen takes Anna's hand but she turns and leaves. Helen
     stands to follow her, but first she whips Stepan's vodka
     away from him.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  You're just how he was. Stupid
                  bloody drunken Russians.

22   EXT. HELEN'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT                              22

     The garden is just outside the kitchen.

     Anna is lighting a cigarette. Helen steps outside and
     reacts to the cigarette. She is about to admonish Anna
     for smoking, but Anna speaks first.

                  Anna, you know what he's like.

                  I don't give a damn about Stepan.
                  Who has that poor baby got in the
                  whole world?

     Helen reacts.

                              HELEN
                  I knew this would happen.

                                ANNA
                  Good. Fine.     So you know
                  everything.

                              HELEN
                  Anna, she isn't your responsibility.

                              ANNA
                  The baby is my responsibility until
                  I hand her over to the mother.
                  The mother is dead.

                               HELEN
                  Then it's up to the proper
                  authorities.

     Anna smiles as if in agreement.

                              ANNA
                  The proper authorities will all be
                  skiing until after New Year.

     Anna coughs a little then stubs her cigarette.        Helen takes
     the butt as if it were poisonous.

                              HELEN
                  It's part of the grieving.

                              ANNA
                  What grieving?

     Helen touches her hand.      An inadequate gesture.

22A   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -22A
      NIGHT

      In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna
      approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is
      tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of
      the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another
      world.

      Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There
      we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin
      to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.

23    INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        23

      The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and
      cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests
      and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing
      violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish
      mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table.
      His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel
      to answer it.

      When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and
      moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides
      his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and
      holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.

                            KIRILL
                    (to child)
                He's called Goofy... Goofy yeah.

                  ...there are no police. You sure?
                  Good.

     Kirill glances over at Semyon, who is apparently lost
     amongst a sea of children, but we see from the corner of
     his eye he is watching Kirill.

               No, my dad's not involved. I'm a

               Yeah. Merry Christmas.

     Kirill cuts the call and nods to Ozim, who stubs his cigar.
     Semyon notices their silent communication, then turns to
     one of the violin-playing angels, smiles, and kisses her
     on both cheeks.

25   EXT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - NIGHT                                25

     We see the car pull up sharply outside Ozim's barber's
     shop. Nikolai jumps out and opens the door for Ozim.

26   OMITTED                                                        26

     The three men walk to the door beside the barber shop.
     Ozim takes a bunch of keys out and prepares to open the
     door to the upstairs. He stops.

                           OZIM
               The driver stays down here.

     Kirill smiles and shakes his head.

                           KIRILL
               You really think I do this kind of
               thing?

     Kirill puts his hand on Nikolai's shoulder

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               This guy's not a driver. He's an
               undertaker.

     Ozim looks at Nikolai, highly dubious.

27   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. UPSTAIRS ROOMS - NIGHT                 27

     The rooms above Ozim's shop have been converted into a
     drinking club. Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the
     debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem
     suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill
     and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression.

                           OZIM
               Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun,
               durgun.

                           EKREM
               I got tickets, Ozim. It's with
               Chelsea. They said there was no
               tickets but I got tickets for the
               Chelsea game.

                             OZIM
               OK, OK, OK.    You go and watch a
               DVD, yeah?

     Ekrem nods and hugs Ozim. We realize he is slightly
     deranged. Finally he lets Ozim go and leaves. Kirill
     watches him go.

                           KIRILL
               He knows to say he hasn't seen us,
               right Ozim?

     Ozim finds the key to the kitchen.

                           OZIM
               He don't know anything.    He's
               touched by the angels.

     Ozim opens the kitchen door.

28   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT                        28

     Inside the kitchen there are carcasses of lambs hanging
     from meat hooks. There are knives and skewers around the
     place. Ozim stops and locks the kitchen door behind them.

29   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT                        29

     The freezer door opens and Ozim gestures towards a large
     package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with
     frost. Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and
     hauls it out onto the kitchen floor. Kirill tears a hole
     in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka.

     Kirill studies the face and nods.

                                KIRILL
                  That's him.

     Kirill crosses himself.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  There was a time when he was like
                  a brother to me.

     He puts his hand on his heart with mock solemnity.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Now he looks like a fucking ice
                  cream.

     Kirill giggles.

                               OZIM
                      (softly)
                  Hey, hey, show some respect for a
                  dead man.

                               KIRILL
                  Respect?   This is respect.

     Kirill reaches into his pocket and produces an envelope
     which he hands to Ozim. As Ozim opens the envelope and
     begins to count the huge wad of cash, Kirill turns to
     Nikolai.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  OK, Nikolai, he's all yours. And
                  show some respect. This Muslim is
                  scared of ghosts.

     Nikolai squeezes the body inside the bags.       It is rock
     hard.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Have you got a hair dryer?

30   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT                            30

     We cut close to an ancient-looking hair dryer from the
     shop downstairs being trained onto a human hand with a
     large eagle tattoo. We pull wide to reveal the full,
     gruesome scene.

     Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his
     head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound
     up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand
     with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which
     has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and
     jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood.
     Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves.

     As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is
     watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms
     folded, mightily impressed.

     Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove
     the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers
     it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a
     contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns
     the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the
     crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel
     of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within
     a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening,
     thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens
     it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows
     hot air onto the money inside.

     He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all
     stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this
     money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously.
     Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai
     as if he were a devil from hell.

     Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it,
     then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the
     frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.

                              NIKOLAI
                  You'd better burn that.

     Ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror
     of it, drops the thing on the floor. Nikolai looks at
     Ozim as if he were a complete amateur.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  Did you finish cutting his hair?

     Ozim can't answer.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  I just thought you might want six-
                  fifty out of his pockets.

     Kirill laughs.    Nikolai takes a deep breath to prepare
     himself.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               OK, now I'm going to do his teeth
               and cut off his fingers.
                   (to Ozim)
               You might want to leave the room.

     Ozim thinks, decides, leaves fast.   A pause.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               You too, Kirill.

     Kirill smiles and pats Nikolai on the cheek.

     Kirill leaves. Nikolai is left alone. His hand shakes a
     little as he picks up his cup of coffee.

31   EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - MORNING                         31

     Nikolai pulls up beside a rusting crane on the abandoned
     dock in a dry-cleaner's van. Kirill watches as Nikolai
     grabs the semi-thawed body, now bagged and tied, lifts it
     onto his shoulder, and smartly approaches the dockside.

                           KIRILL
               Aren't you going to weight him
               down or something?

     Nikolai drops the body into the water with a splash.

                            NIKOLAI
               If you want to dump a body, this
               is the place. The currents keep
               it under the surface until past
               the barrier.

     Nikolai and Kirill watch as the body is swallowed by a
     fast ocean-bound current.

               My friend said he would get me to

33   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         33

     Semyon sits alone at the dinner table in the restaurant
     where before there was family and uproar. Outside it's
     dark and raining. He is reading a Russian crime novel. A
     half-empty bottle of vodka sits on the table.

     Tatiana's voice-over continues as we cut inside the
     restaurant.

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  My friend says his uncle owns the
                  restaurant where you can sing. He
                  is sure this man will take care of
                  me.

     There is a knock at the door and Semyon looks up sharply.
     His eyes glisten. He puts his novel aside.

34   INT./EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. DOOR - NIGHT              34

     Semyon is unlocking the door and discovering, in the drizzle
     and half light, that it is Anna.

                              SEMYON
                  Ah. My dear! I wasn't expecting

                  Is it OK?

35   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         35

     Semyon and Anna are sitting down at the candlelit table.
     Anna fumbles in her bag and produces a sheaf of photocopied
     sheets. She has photocopied the pages of the diary and
     they are laid out in segments on each page.

                              ANNA
                  I copied the whole thing.

     Semyon takes the pages and looks troubled.

                              SEMYON
                  Where is the original?

                  it to Tatiana's daughter someday.

     Semyon looks thwarted but hides it well. He studies the
     photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles.

                              SEMYON
                  I will need my spectacles and a
                  clear head. Today I broke my rules
                  and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will
                  translate it.

     He folds the papers carefully.

     perhaps remembers Nikolai. Finally...

                  Not far.    I can drop by and pick

                  I'm fine.    I'm on my motorbike.

     Semyon stares at her for a moment.

                              SEMYON
                  So what will happen to the poor

     Semyon doesn't blink. At that moment a little girl of
     seven (MARIA) emerges from the darkness, carrying a soft
     toy.

                              MARIA
               Grandpa.

                           SEMYON
               Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed.

               I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't
               for another hundreds and hundreds
               of days.

     Semyon takes her onto his knee. As he does, we see, for
     the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist.

                           SEMYON
               But you have had so many presents.

     The girl wafts Semyon's cigar smoke.

                           MARIA
               You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa.

                              SEMYON
               I know.

     Semyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar.

     Anna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering
     her own father.

36   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        36

     Nikolai gets out of the Mercedes and helps an extremely
     pissed Kirill out of the car into the rain. Kirill is so
     drunk he slips through Nikolai's hands and lands in the
     gutter.

                           KIRILL
               We're partners now, man, you know?

                              NIKOLAI
                  Yeah, yeah, I know.

     Nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again. As they
     head towards the restaurant, Anna emerges. Nikolai looks
     up, curious, as Semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the
     doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses
     in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face
     splashed with rain.

                             NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  What? You never seen anybody pissed
                  before?

     Semyon looks down at the drunken Kirill and slams the door
     of the restaurant. Nikolai sighs, then turns to Kirill
     and starts to go through his pockets.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  Come on, Kirill. Where are your
                  keys?

     Anna walks around the two of them, watching the undignified
     struggle as Nikolai finds Kirill's keys. Nikolai smiles
     at her.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  Who are you, anyway?

     Anna hurries away into the rain. Nikolai finds Kirill's
     keys and drags him toward the door of the restaurant.

37   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          37

     Nikolai heaves Kirill into a chair. Semyon is back at his
     novel and watches as Kirill attempts to get to his feet
     and then stumbles to the floor. He slumps down, now
     totally unconscious, breathing deeply. Nikolai smiles.

                              NIKOLAI
                  We went to a Kurdish place. They
                  don't even celebrate Christmas.

     Semyon steps up to where Kirill is lying and stands over
     him for a moment. Then he kicks him hard in the guts with
     all his might. Nikolai is shocked, and grabs Semyon's
     arm. A hand laid upon him is like deadly poison. Kirill
     grunts and moans.

                              KIRILL
                  Hey, Papa, what did I do?    This is
                  Merry Christmas or what?

     Semyon kicks him hard in the guts again.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I think he's had enough.

     Nikolai steps in between Semyon and Kirill. Semyon is
     shocked that anyone should face him like this.

                              SEMYON
                  Who... the fuck... are you to tell
                  me enough?

     Nikolai's face hardens.

                              NIKOLAI
                  We're partners.

     Nikolai looks down at Kirill.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  He's thunder, I'm lightning. He
                  makes all the noise, I do all the
                  damage.

                              SEMYON
                  I hired you as a driver...

     Semyon bends to roughly hoist Kirill into a chair.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  ...someone to stop him killing
                  himself.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Well, you got more than a driver.

     Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and
     offers it to Semyon. As Semyon looks at the card in the
     candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on
     Nikolai's hand.

     It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to
     Semyon, and he reacts.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  I run a mini-cab business.

     A pause.

                I only took this job so that I
                could get to meet you.
                    (in Russian)
                I think you and I could do business
                together.

     A pause.   Semyon looks at Nikolai with utter contempt.

                            SEMYON
                I have no idea what business you're
                talking about. Now get out.

     Nikolai smiles and then leaves. Semyon watches him go
     then peers at his drunken, sleeping son with something
     approaching compassion.

38   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          38

     Nikolai hurries   out to his car in the rain. He hears an
     engine splutter   and spots Anna still trying to kick-start
     her motorbike.    He approaches. She's already soaked.
     Nikolai watches   her try to start the bike and fail.

                            NIKOLAI
                You've got water in it.

     Deadpan, Anna looks up and holds out her hand into pouring
     rain.

                              ANNA
                Water?    What makes you think that?

     Anna tries to start the bike again.    Nothing.

                            NIKOLAI
                The postmen used these. In my
                village. When I was a boy. Russian
                copy of BMW flat twin.

     Anna tries one more time to start the bike and growls with
     fury. Nikolai gently takes her shoulders and after a brief
     resistance Anna climbs off the bike. Nikolai sits astride
     it. He kicks it. It fails to start. Anna folds her arms.

     Anna curses under her breath. Nikolai isn't sure what to
     make of her. She begins to chain the bike's rear wheel.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                You got far to go?

     Anna tucks her crash helmet under her arm and prepares to
     set off walking.

                            ANNA
                Just across the park.

                            NIKOLAI
                I'm a driver. I even do limousines.
                Look...

     Nikolai opens the rear car door.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                If Semyon found out I let one of
                his guests walk home in the rain,
                he'd fire me. And I can take care
                of your bike. So...

     Nikolai holds open the rear car door.       Rain pours.

39   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                       39

     Nikolai is driving Anna through the rain-swept streets.
     The wipers beat time as they drive in silence. As Nikolai
     holds the steering wheel, Anna sees the intricate detail
     of the eagle tattoo on the back of his right hand.

                            NIKOLAI
                So you're a midwife. Jesus.

     Anna smiles politely.

                What's it like?

                            ANNA
                You get used to it.

     A pause.   Nikolai seems vaguely horrified at a memory.

                            NIKOLAI
                I didn't faint, but it was close.

     Nikolai turns.

                  So Semyon employs you?

                  I'm... sort of freelance.

                              ANNA
                  You said he'd fire you.

     Nikolai doesn't answer.      Anna decides she can be bold.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Did you ever meet a girl called

                  In that case, no, I never heard of
                  her.

     Anna doesn't care for the smile on Nikolai's face.

               Oh yeah. And the ice. Whole lakes

      in.

40    EXT. THE BANKS OF THE THAMES - NEXT MORNING                   40

      Somewhere within sight of the Thames barrier.

      A dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling
      round on a shale beach, the icy waters of the Thames lapping
      at their feet.

40A   INT. FORENSIC TENT - MORNING                                  40A

      A large tent has been erected over the body of Soyka. Inside
      the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a
      third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who
      is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been
      dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body.
      One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows
      him the eagle tattoo.

                            OFFICER
                We think he might be Russian Mafia.

      Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches
      to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg.
      When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small
      star tattooed on the knee cap.

                            YURI
                He is actually a Chechen. He is
                also a member of the vory v zakone.
                The stars on the knees mean he
                would never kneel before anyone.

      Yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an
      eight-pointed star on his chest.

                            YURI (CONT'D)
                In Russian prisons, your life story
                is written on your body in tattoos.

      He then checks out the fingers in the torchlight and we

      Yuri straightens and grabs a paper towel to wipe his hands.

                There was something else. It was...
                inside the body. Chest cavity.

      The officer holds up a small zip-lock bag which has a
      handwritten note sealed inside it. The handwriting is just
      visible through the wet cellophane.

40B   EXT. THE BANKS OF THE THAMES - MORNING                          40B

      Yuri steps outside the forensic tent. He opens the bag and
      takes out the note. He unfolds it to read, then smiles to
      himself.

41    INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - MORNING                    41

      Anna is drying her hair, looking at herself in the mirror.
      She turns off the dryer. There is a knock on the door.

                               HELEN
                Anna?

      Helen enters looking anxious.    We see Stepan hovering in
      the background.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                Stepan, come here. Tell her what
                you told me.

      Stepan stands primly in the doorway, strangely defiant.

                            ANNA
                What?
                    (pause)
                Stepan, what? I'm late for work.

      He shakes his head angrily. Finally from behind his back
      he produces Tatiana's diary.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                Who gave you that?

                            HELEN
                It was on the dresser.

                            ANNA
                Mum, you can't go through my things.

                And he said he wouldn't do it so
                I've found somebody else.

     Stepan explodes.

                            STEPAN
                No Anna! You don't go to someone
                else with this! You don't go to
                anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape.
                Iglah, it means needle.
                Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.

     Stepan hands the diary to Anna and then turns.

                            STEPAN (CONT'D)
                I go to wash my hands.

     He disappears. Anna and Helen are left in awkward silence.
     Anna buries the diary in her dressing table drawer. Helen
     looks at her with anxiety.

                            HELEN
                Anna, Stepan said this girl ended
                up in the hands of the vory v
                zakone. Do you know what that
                means?

                            ANNA
                Just because I'm back in this room
                doesn't mean I'm twelve again.

                            HELEN
                You never listened to me even then!

                            ANNA
                Look, if I don't find a relative
                in the next few days they'll put
                Christine out for fostering. Once
                she's in the system, she'll never
                get out again.

     A pause.

                            HELEN
                Who named her Christine?

                I had to call her something. It

                    (pause)
                She's very beautiful.

     Helen is now deeply concerned.

                            HELEN
                If I can persuade Stepan to
                translate it, will you leave the
                rest to the police?

     Anna looks at Helen, then digs out the diary and hands it
     to her.

                            ANNA
                Tell him I've heard bad words
                before.

     Helen is about to leave.       She stops in the doorway.

                            HELEN
                Your father used to say the vory
                are a contagious disease. There's
                no cure once they've touched you.

     A pause.   Anna smiles.

                Momma, this is London.

42   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. NEGLECTED SITTING ROOM - DAY                42

     We are in HARLESDEN, NORTH LONDON.

     A large portable stereo is playing rock music.

     The curtains are drawn against daylight. The living room
     is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the
     wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. Kitsch
     paintings still decorate the walls.

     Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down
     sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts. Their
     eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but
     they are painted with so much make-up they almost look
     like tiny, sad clowns.

     They sit in silence as the music blares out. After a few
     moments a young Albanian man enters and claps his hands.

                  OK, boss is here. Boss, boss.
                  You make him happy...

     All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet
     and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving
     awkwardly and painfully. The Albanian approaches the one
     girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet.

     He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian. She tries
     to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again.
     Finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she
     begins to dance, sobbing as she does.

                              ALBANIAN (CONT'D)
                  No fucking crying. It's a party!

43   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY                                        43

     Kirill and Nikolai are climbing out of Nikolai's Mercedes.
     Kirill is in full flow as they walk towards the house.
     The rock music is audible outside the house.

                              KIRILL
                  So he said to me, `who is this
                  driver guy?' I laughed so hard.

     Kirill knocks on the door hard.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  And I said you were the safest guy
                  I'd met. Solid.

     A pause.

                              NIKOLAI
                  And what did he say?

                              KIRILL
                  You know my dad. He didn't say
                  nothing. But his eyes looked
                  impressed.

     The door opens and the Albanian opens his arms in welcome.

                                ALBANIAN
                  Kirill!

                              KIRILL

                  black gypsy baboon.

     Kirill pushes his way inside and Nikolai follows.

44   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. SITTING ROOM - DAY                              44

     Kirill and Nikolai are swigging whisky from the bottle and
     dancing with the girls. Some of the girls are drinking,
     too, and managing to laugh. Kirill is dancing maniacally
     and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she
     falls over.

     Nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused
     to stand up. She is standing in the corner, sobbing.
     Nikolai doesn't care to look at her for more than a second
     and he goes back to dancing.

     After a moment Kirill dances his way over to Nikolai and
     yells above the music.

                              KIRILL
                  OK, which one you going to fuck!?

                  Serious.      Pick one.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I'm just enjoying myself, man...

     Kirill suddenly stops dancing and stares at Nikolai.          He
     yells again over the music.

                              KIRILL
                  You hear me? You're going to fuck
                  one of these girls.

                  girls right now. That's an order.

                  What?       What's the matter with you?

     Kirill suddenly goes to the stereo system and yanks the
     plug from the wall. Silence. The girls look terrified.
     The only sound is the sobbing of the girl who won't dance.

                  fucking queer.

     Kirill looks suddenly wild.          He swigs his whisky.   A long
     pause.

                              NIKOLAI
                  You've drunk enough Kirill.

                                 KIRILL
                  Enough?

     Kirill hurls his whisky bottle against the wall.            The girls
     all flinch.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)

                  I've brought you to my dad's best
                  stable. He uses this place himself.
                  They're all clean. Now I'm going
                  to watch you fuck one of these
                  girls to prove to me that you ain't
                  queer.

                  So which one is it going to be?

     Silence. Nikolai looks around the room.           Finally... Nikolai
     turns to the girl who is sobbing.

                                 NIKOLAI
                  Her.

     Kirill smiles.

45   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY                             45

     Nikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent.   She is on
     all fours, registering no emotion.

     Kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the
     bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and
     drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth
     and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and
     begins to applaud.

     The girl is still silent, expressionless.

                              KIRILL
               You did OK!     You did OK.

                              NIKOLAI
               Yeah?

     Nikolai glares at Kirill.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               Well if my examination is over,
               get the fuck out of here while I
               get dressed.

     Kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before
     leaving. Finally alone, Nikolai gently helps the girl to
     lie down. She is numb. He covers her up with a blanket
     then begins to pull on his clothes. The girl is staring up
     at the ceiling.

     After a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song
     softly under her breath. Nikolai speaks to her softly in
     Russian.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   (in Russian)
               What's your last name?

     Nikolai is insistent.

     She sees some urgency there...

     linger. He heads for the door then stops and turns.

46   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -46
     NIGHT

     In the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine
     in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The
     door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other
     babies are silent.

     Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib.
     She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She
     curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined
     to pull herself together.

     As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward,
     she is suddenly confronted by Semyon.

     He is standing in the shadows, a Bavarian trilby in his
     hands. Anna gasps with shock. Semyon speaks softly...

                                 SEMYON
                  Hello Anna.     I came on tiptoes.

                              ANNA
                  How did you get in here?

     Anna glances at an alarm button.

                            ANNA
                You're not allowed in here.

                            SEMYON
                Please Anna, let me speak.

     Semyon looks to be almost in tears.     He speaks softly.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                I translated the diary...

     A baby begins to cry and is comforted somewhere across the
     ward.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                I was shocked to discover... that
                my son Kirill is mentioned many
                times.

     Semyon appears to be fighting tears.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                I have known for some years that
                he has strayed from the path I set
                out for him. His mother died when
                he was very young.

     A pause.   Anna almost begins to buy his sorrow...

                            ANNA
                What does it say about him?

     Semyon looks up, his eyes filled with tears.

                            SEMYON
                Many bad things.

     A pause.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                But Anna please. Let me deal with
                him. If the diary should find its
                way to the police...

     Semyon wipes his eyes.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                Some of the things my son did are
                illegal. Anna, he is a good boy.

     A pause.

                             ANNA
                 I don't care about him.   I care
                 about the baby.

                              SEMYON
                 Of course.   Of course. And that is
                 the baby?

     Semyon glances over Anna's shoulder into the corner where
     Christine is sleeping. Anna freezes and doesn't reply.
     Semyon takes her hand.

                             SEMYON (CONT'D)
                 Anna, I have made some inquiries
                 and I have found out an address
                 for Tatiana's family in Russia.
                 That's where the baby belongs, no?

     Anna reacts but Semyon's face suddenly hardens...

                             SEMYON (CONT'D)
                 So... perhaps we can do a deal.

     He stares into her eyes.

                             SEMYON (CONT'D)
                 Do you understand me, Anna?

     At that moment a nurse walks by and hesitates when she
     sees Semyon.

                              NURSE
                 Anna?

                              ANNA
                 It's OK.   He's just leaving.

     Semyon puts his hat onto his head.

                             SEMYON
                 You know where I am, Anna Ivanovna.

     He turns.

                             SEMYON (CONT'D)
                 And I know where you are.

     Semyon disappears into the shadows of the ward.     As Anna
     reacts we hear Tatiana in V.O.

47   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                              47

     Stepan is sitting at the kitchen table, translating
     Tatiana's diary aloud, as Helen transcribes it onto a note
     pad. Stepan's translation breaks up with emotion but he
     tries to remain detached. Helen also tries hard to
     concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes.
     Tatiana's V.O. slowly blends into Stepan's voice...

                           STEPAN
               ...like potato sacks. Kirill came
               down after me and he hit me until
               I was bleeding. Then he tried to
               rape me but he couldn't do it...
               He just got madder and madder and
               kept hitting me. In the end his
               father came down. It was the father
               who raped me. He shouted at his
               son...'if you don't break a horse,
               it will never be tame, Kirill'.

     They hear a key in the door and prepare for Anna's arrival.
     When she enters she feels the tense silence. After a
     moment, Helen tries to be bright...

                           HELEN
               Hello dear. How was your night?

     Anna sees the tears in both their eyes.   She sees the diary
     and the transcription and sits down.

                           HELEN (CONT'D)
               Stepan's arthritis is playing up.
               I'm taking dictation.

     Helen gets to her feet.

                           HELEN (CONT'D)
               Would you like some tea or
               something?

                             ANNA
               No.

     Anna gently pushes Helen back into her seat.

                  I told you this would happen!    I

                Shut up both of you!!!

                We all know what he would have
                done.

     Stepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle
     of vodka. Rather than admonish him, Anna and Helen both
     nod agreement. Stepan pours three large vodkas. Stepan
     knocks his down. Anna and Helen take sips.

                            HELEN
                And then he would have been
                practical.

                             STEPAN
                He would ask if there were bullets
                for the gun.

                            HELEN
                No! This isn't our world.     We're

                Then it's settled.

48   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NEXT DAY                       48

     Nikolai pulls up in his car. He checks his look in the
     rear view mirror and puts on his sunglasses. As he gets
     out of the car he notices that Anna's motorbike is still
     there. He approaches it, strokes the bodywork. Suddenly,
     someone grabs him from behind. It's Kirill.

                           KIRILL
               Hey, come on, Nikolai, I've got a
               Christmas present for you.

49   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. BACK DELIVERY AREA - DAY        49

     A white van is parked with its rear doors open, ready for
     unloading. Kirill shows Nikolai that the van is loaded
     with unmarked white boxes.

                              KIRILL
               Open one.

     Nikolai opens one of the boxes and produces a bottle of
     vintage champagne.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               From France. Old as fuck. Old is
               good with wine. Sixty quid a bottle
               anywhere. Except I got them for
               ten quid a case.

               From where?

               `From where?' From where you don't
               ask. Give it here...

     Kirill snatches the bottle and begins to uncork it.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  If my dad says OK, I can start
                  telling you about the serious stuff.
                  Import, export. This booze is just
                  for gifts to Papa's friends. The
                  real import stuff is from Kabul,
                  you understand?

     He pops the cork and swigs the frothing champagne.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Import-export sounds good.

     Kirill laughs.

                              KIRILL
                  You bet it's fucking good...

     Nikolai hands the bottle back. As he does, one of the van
     doors is kicked closed revealing Semyon, suddenly upon
     them.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Jesus Christ, Papa... You scared
                  me....

     Semyon grabs the bottle of champagne and smashes it on the
     floor. Kirill recoils in terror. Nikolai straightens,
     faces up.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  What's wrong? We're just sampling
                  it!

     Semyon is so furious he still can't speak. He grabs Kirill
     and slams him against the wall. Finally he hisses in his
     face.

                              SEMYON
                  Your friend Soyka is dead.

                              KIRILL
                  Yeah? So what? What's that got
                  to do with me?

                              SEMYON
                  Don't lie to me!!

     Semyon slams Kirill against the wall once more.

               I swear I don't know nothing about
               it...

                           SEMYON
               I said, don't lie to me!

     Semyon slams Kirill hard against the wall again.       Suddenly
     Nikolai steps forward.

                           NIKOLAI
               Your dad is right, Kirill.       There's
               no point lying to him.

     A pause. Semyon and Kirill are frozen for a moment.
     Nikolai calmly lights a cigarette.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               Ozim's nephew slit Soyka's throat.
               Kirill paid him to do it.

     There is stunned silence.       Semyon loosens his grip on
     Kirill.

                           KIRILL
                   (in Russian)
               Shut your fucking mouth!

                           NIKOLAI
                   (in Russian)
               Your dad always knows the truth
               anyway.

     Nikolai and Semyon survey each other.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               But it's OK boss. You don't have
               to worry...

                           SEMYON
                   (incredulous)
               I don't have to worry?

                           NIKOLAI
               I disposed of the body myself. The
               police won't find a thing.

     Semyon has now lost all interest in Kirill and is
     concentrating on Nikolai. He laughs with incredulity.

                           SEMYON
               My son commits a murder?

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               On my own doorstep? A fellow
               soldier! And no one thought to
               tell me about it?

                           NIKOLAI
               The vory code says you don't talk
               to anybody about your captain.
               Kirill is my captain.

     Semyon circles Nikolai.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               When I found out what had happened,
               I did what I had to do to clean
               the situation up.

     Kirill is about to speak but before he can, Nikolai speaks
     for him.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               It was a matter of honor. Soyka
               was spreading lies about Kirill.
               About your family.
                   (in Russian)
               Kirill did the right thing.

     Semyon hisses with fury and grabs Nikolai.

                           SEMYON
               I decide what is right and what is
               wrong. You do not kill a vor for
               no reason.

     Nikolai shrugs Semyon off, holding his ground.

                           NIKOLAI
               You know as well as I do Soyka was
               talking to the police.

     A pause. Semyon is shocked at the depth of Nikolai's
     knowledge. He peers at him.

                           SEMYON
               For a driver, you are well informed.

                           NIKOLAI
               I've got connections with the
               Chechens who export cars. Soyka
               was speaking to the Russian desk.
               Scotland Yard.

     A pause.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    (in Russian)
                Kirill did a good thing for all
                our people. Our people will know
                that.

     In Semyon's silence Kirill finally gathers courage...

                            KIRILL
                Papa, I swear to you, I was going
                to...

                              SEMYON
                Shut up!

     Kirill is hurt that Semyon seems only to be interested in
     Nikolai. After studying Nikolai for a while...

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                If you are so well informed, you
                will know Soyka has brothers.

                            NIKOLAI
                    (with a smile)
                That's OK. Kirill has got me.

     Semyon shows the first flicker of admiration. He then
     looks at Kirill with utter contempt, making the comparison
     with Nikolai obvious.

                            SEMYON
                Get these boxes out of sight.

     Semyon leaves them. Kirill is angry, straightening his
     clothes. Finally he yells....

                            KIRILL
                You heard him, patsan!   Get these
                boxes out of sight.

50   INT. BURGER RESTAURANT - DAY                                   50

     It is Saturday morning and the place is full of families.
     Christmas decorations are beginning to look ragged.

     Anna and Helen are sitting at a table, terrified but trying
     hard to stay calm. Stepan arrives with a tray of coffees
     and a burger. He sits, and Anna and Helen glance uneasily
     at each other. Stepan begins to eat noisily.

                              ANNA
                  How the hell can you eat?

                                STEPAN
                  I'm hungry.

     There is a tension that builds until Nikolai's Mercedes
     suddenly looms into view, filling the street window of the
     burger bar. Nikolai gets out of his car, all shades and
     sharp suit.

                              ANNA
                  That's their driver.

     Stepan very deliberately slides his hand into his inside
     pocket.

                              HELEN
                      (hissing)
                  Tell me you haven't done anything
                  ridiculous...

     Stepan removes his hand, empty, his bravado crushed.

     Nikolai enters the restaurant and spots Anna. He comes
     and sits at the table beside Stepan, opposite Anna. It's
     a tight squeeze. Anna and Helen are stiff with terror.
     Nikolai smiles.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Meet in a public place with lots
                  of people around. Very wise.

     He smiles at Helen.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  And I see you brought along a body
                  guard. Also very wise.

     Stepan is shaking with emotion and hisses something in
     Russian.

               When I was in the KGB, we knew how
               to deal with scum like you.

     Nikolai smiles.

                           NIKOLAI

                           HELEN
               Shush, Stepan. Anna?

     Nikolai is amused by the three of them. Anna produces
     Tatiana's diary and hands it to Nikolai. Nikolai studies
     it and nods. He gets to his feet...

                           ANNA
                   (shaking)
               Now you give me the address.

                           NIKOLAI
               What address?

                           ANNA
               Tatiana's family.

                           NIKOLAI
               I don't know what you're talking
               about.

     Nikolai calmly heads for the door.      Stepan hisses.

                                STEPAN
               I told you!       I knew they would do
               this....

     Anna gets to her feet.

                                HELEN
               Anna!      No!   Come back here!

     Anna races out of the restaurant in pursuit of Nikolai.

51   EXT. BURGER RESTAURANT - DAY                                     51

     Nikolai has emerged into the busy suburban street and is
     about to get in to his car. Anna flies at him, yelling.

                  She was fourteen! Read the diary!
                  She was fourteen when he raped
                  her!

     Nikolai casually hits the key fob of his car.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  You murdered her! You bastards
                  murdered her!

     Passers-by stare at Anna. Helen and Stepan have come out
     of the restaurant to restrain her. Nikolai stops and judges
     the fury on Anna's face. He speaks calmly.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Anger is very dangerous. It makes
                  people do stupid things. Forget
                  any of this ever happened. You're
                  in the wrong place, Anna Ivanovna.

     He gestures at the burger restaurant.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  You belong in there. With nice
                  people. Stay away from people
                  like me.

     Anna and Nikolai are staring at each other, suddenly a
     strange connection between them.

     Then Stepan steps forward and spits in Nikolai's face,
     delivering a Russian curse as he does so. Nikolai almost
     reacts out of instinct but stops himself.

     Nikolai wipes his face and peers into Anna's eyes.       Finally
     he gets into his car and drives away.

52   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             52

     Nikolai is alone, sitting at a candlelit table, reading
     Tatiana's diary. We hear Tatiana in voice-over...

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  I am not sure I can carry on another
                  day. The windows won't open so I
                  can't throw myself out. They inject
                  me every day with heroin.

                  Sometimes I think this is all a
                  hallucination...

     He sees Semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the
     diary. Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his
     way to sit opposite Nikolai. Nikolai pushes the diary
     across the table. Semyon pours two drinks.

                              SEMYON
                  It is good to have someone who I
                  can trust to do simple tasks.

     A pause as Semyon glances at a few pages of diary.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  In this business, sometimes the
                  biggest danger comes from the most
                  stupid things. You can't afford
                  to be careless in any area.

     Nikolai senses a change of attitude towards him. As if
     Semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold. Semyon
     raises a toast.

                               SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Nasdrovia.

                               NIKOLAI
                  Nasdrovia.

     After a moment.

                              SEMYON
                  So what was the lie that Soyka was
                  spreading about my son?

     Nikolai looks anxious.

                              NIKOLAI
                      (in Russian)
                  It was nothing important.

                              SEMYON
                  Kirill had him killed for nothing
                  important?

     Semyon pours two more vodkas.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I don't want to repeat it.

                    (smiling)
                For me you will repeat it.

     Nikolai doesn't respond. It is obvious that Semyon half
     knows already. He shrugs...

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                You play   with the Prince to do
                business   with the King. But if
                you want   to do business with me
                you must   be open with me. Thieves-
                in-law.

     A pause.   Semyon nurses his vodka.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                What was Soyka saying about the
                Prince?

     He stares into Nikolai's eyes.    Finally, Nikolai stammers...

                            NIKOLAI
                That he is a drunk.    And that he
                is also... a queer.

     Semyon swigs his vodka and Nikolai swigs his. Semyon pours
     two more. Semyon has to stare out of the window to hide
     his emotion.

                             SEMYON
                    (softly, in Russian)
                My only son.

     They both knock their drinks back. Semyon looks suddenly
     angry as he peers out of the window.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                You know it never snows in this
                City. And it's never hot. London
                is a city of whores and queers.
                My son...

     Semyon shrugs, fighting deeper emotion...

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                ...I think London is to blame for
                what he is...

                So why don't you go home?

     Semyon smiles, as if seeing Moscow through the window.

                            SEMYON
                The cold gets into my bones.

     A pause.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                And also... the KGB would be waiting
                for me.

     Nikolai smiles ruefully and glances at Semyon.

                             NIKOLAI
                FSB.   They are called FSB now.

                            SEMYON
                Whatever they call them they are
                worse even than the KGB were. Maybe
                the KGB and the vory v zakone were
                partners in a marriage. We had
                rules, they had rules.

     He swigs some more vodka.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                Now in Moscow, the thieves don't
                wear tattoos and the police don't
                wear uniforms. You never know who
                they are...

     Semyon seems to be taking the vodka less well than Nikolai.
     He pours some more.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                You've heard about these new
                policemen?

     Nikolai doesn't blink.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                They get under you, over you, behind
                you, inside you. They are the
                ones you least expect.

     Semyon peers at Nikolai and Nikolai doesn't respond.
     Mention of the new breed of FSB agent causes an almost
     imperceptible tension in Nikolai.

     Is Semyon too drunk to notice? There is a strange game
     going on here. For now, nothing is revealed.

     Semyon knocks back his vodka and Nikolai does the same.
     Semyon picks up the diary and holds it into the flame of
     the candle. It begins to burn and he drops it into the
     ashtray. The flames flicker for a while.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                The midwife said she had an uncle.
                A Russian.

                              NIKOLAI
                I met him.

                            SEMYON
                So you know what he looks like.

     Semyon peers at Nikolai.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                She said he has read the diary.

     A pause.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                We can't trust a Russian with that
                kind of information.

     A pause.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                    (in Russian)
                Do you understand me?

     Semyon gets to his feet and smiles.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                Perhaps you can deal with him.

     Semyon leaves Nikolai to stare into the flames of the
     burning diary.

53   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. MATERNITY UNIT - DAY                   53

     Anna exits, pulling on her coat against the cold. She
     stops in her tracks when she sees her unchained motorbike
     parked in the parking bay. She hears Nikolai's voice over
     her shoulder.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I thought I'd bring it back before
                  it got stolen. Lot of villains
                  around. Sorry about the chain.

     Anna is about to walk quickly away...

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  I got that address you wanted.

     Anna turns and sees Nikolai is offering a scrap of paper.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  A little village outside St.
                  Petersburg. I know it. Not much
                  of a place for a kid to grow up
                  in. Especially not a girl.

     She hesitates.       Nikolai approaches and gives her the
     address.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  If you want my opinion, the kid
                  would be better off in London.
                  Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana's
                  family don't sound like the kind
                  of people who'd want another mouth
                  to feed.

     A pause.

                              ANNA
                  You read the diary?

     Nikolai looks all around.        Anna studies him, unsure.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  So how can you keep doing what

     Anna sees some softness in his expression.        Their eyes
     lock.

                              ANNA
                  You look the other way.

                Does he live with you?

     Anna is about to answer but stops herself. Nikolai peers

     gestures at the bike.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                I fixed it.    It should be OK now.

     Anna watches him walk away into the street.

54   EXT. CHELSEA FOOTBALL GROUND. SIDE STREETS - NIGHT.               54

     Crowds of football supporters are streaming away from the
     football stadium, where the floodlights are still casting
     their glow. There are Arsenal and Chelsea supporters on
     opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly
     vicious yelling between the two groups. Police are visibly
     keeping order.

     Among the crowd we see Ekrem. He seems slightly drunk on
     top of his normal craziness. He has an Arsenal scarf around
     his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the Chelsea
     supporters across the street.

                             EKREM
                  Hey! Hey Kabuka Chelsea! Fuck
                  you!! Yeah you! Aliverisme!!
                  Fucker!

     A policeman steps up to Ekrem and gives him a shove and he
     stumbles a little. As he gets to his feet we notice TWO
     CHECHEN MEN who are trailing Ekrem, ducking their heads
     away from the line of policemen.

55   EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT                                           55

     Ekrem is now isolated from the crowds, swigging from a can
     of lager. He is chanting `Arsenal, Arsenal' to himself as
     he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave.

     In the background the two Chechens are coming closer. As
     Ekrem zips his flies, the Chechens are upon him. One of
     them grabs his Arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him.

     Ekrem chokes for a while and the Chechen loosens the knot.
     The second Chechen pulls out an open razor. Ekrem struggles
     to escape...

                              CHECHEN
                  For my brother...

     The Chechen cuts Ekrem's throat then drops him onto the
     grave stone.

     The place has two dozen customers and there is a Russian
     band playing `Dark Eyes'. At a particular table an old
     Russian lady is having her birthday celebrated by an adoring
     family and lots of very ancient friends.

     There is a huge round of applause as Semyon emerges from
     the kitchen with a cake decorated with sparklers.

     approaches.

58   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN REAR - NIGHT            58

     Semyon emerges into the wine crates and beer bottles in
     the yard at the back of the restaurant where the Doberman
     is straining at the leash, snarling and barking. An already
     anxious Ozim is cowering in the shadows, held at bay by
     the dog.

     The moment Semyon steps out the dog stops barking. Ozim
     relaxes a little and steps forward. Semyon pets the dog.

                              SEMYON
                  So what did they say?

     Semyon takes a swig of vodka.    Ozim looks severely nervous.

                              OZIM
                  They were going to kill me.   Those
                  Chechens are savages.

     Ozim is reliving the ordeal.

                              OZIM (CONT'D)
                  I pointed out that I am a Muslim
                  too and it is a sin for a Muslim
                  to kill a Muslim.

                  They said they would spare me only
                  if I delivered Kirill to them.

                              SEMYON
                  You are being very honest.

                              OZIM
                  I fear you more than I fear them.

     Semyon suddenly breaks the neck of the bottle and holds
     the jagged edge to Ozim's throat. The dog snarls at
     Semyon's feet.

                  No. They have just arrived from

59   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        59

     Anna is reading the translation of the diary by lamplight.
     Tatiana's voice over continues.

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  I know now for sure that I am
                  pregnant. It hasn't begun to show
                  yet. After I was raped they made
                  me take pills but I guess it was
                  too late. I am condemned to give
                  birth to a new life. But first I
                  will try to find a way to end my
                  own life and spare this child the
                  pain.

     Anna looks up from the pages and thinks.

60   EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - NIGHT                                    60

     A large public housing estate is being swept by rain.
     Christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated
     tower blocks. Stepan is walking against the wind, carrying
     a bag of shopping. He holds onto his Russian hat to stop
     it blowing away. Kids splash in the puddles.

     Stepan arrives at the front garden of his small, ground-
     floor council flat. As he fumbles for his keys in the cold
     we see that Nikolai is watching him from the driver's seat
     of his Mercedes. Once Stepan has disappeared into his
     flat, Nikolai gets out of the car and approaches Stepan's
     flat.

61   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - NIGHT                            61

     Helen is preparing food for a small family dinner. Anna
     enters with her cellphone in her hand. She mooches for
     food to hide her agenda. Finally...

                           ANNA
               Mum... I can't get hold of Stepan.

                           HELEN
               Why do you want to?

                           ANNA
               I need to check something with
               him.

                             HELEN
               Anna...

                           ANNA
                   (matter of fact)
               He's not at home, do you know where
               else he might be?

     Helen simply stares at her.

                           HELEN
               Anna. Haven't you had enough
               excitement?

                           ANNA
                   (deadpan)
               I think I've worked out who

     Helen slams her knife down.

                              HELEN
                      (yelling)
                  Why does it matter?!!

                      (firmly)
                  It matters... to me!!

     A pause. After a moment Helen goes to her, holds her hands
     and peers into her eyes. We expect comforting words, but
     instead...

                              HELEN
                  You enjoy this.

     A pause.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  You're like your father. Ordinary
                  life isn't enough.

     Anna turns and walks out of the house.

62   EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT                                   62

     Anna drives her motorbike through North London streets.
     Rain is falling.

63   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        63

     Anna is standing in the falling rain, staring over at the
     trans-Siberian restaurant. The restaurant is busy, with
     the noise of revelers swelling every time the door is
     opened.

     Anna seems to be exiled from where she should really be -

     Inside a restaurant like this, with its danger and vibrancy.

     Suddenly she is illuminated by headlights. She turns and
     sees that Nikolai is pulling up in his Mercedes. Kirill is
     in the passenger seat. Nikolai gets out of the car and
     stops when he sees Anna. Anna is like a fox caught in
     headlights.

                              NIKOLAI
                  What are you doing here?

     A pause.

                              ANNA
                      (echoing Nikolai's
                       words)
                  I don't know. I was passing.

     Kirill studies the gaze between Nikolai and Anna and senses
     the connection.

                              KIRILL
                  If you're passing, you pass. You
                  keep going, bitch. Nikolai, come
                  on...

     Kirill grabs Nikolai's arm, and after peering at Anna for
     a moment, he turns to go with Kirill. Anna gathers her
     courage.

                              ANNA
                  Family is important to you people
                  isn't it?

                              KIRILL
                      (laughing)
                  'You people'?
                      (in Russian)
                  What the hell is she talking about?

     Music swells from the restaurant.

                              ANNA
                  Tell Semyon the baby I delivered
                  on Christmas Eve is his daughter.

     Kirill and Nikolai stop. A swell of laughter from the
     restaurant. Anna is about to continue but Nikolai steps
     forward and places two fingers on Anna's lips to stop her
     from saying anymore. Anna tears his hands from her mouth.

     At the same time Kirill yells in Russian.

                              KIRILL
                      (in Russian)
                  What did she say?!

     Anna is terrified but angry too.    She yells.

                              ANNA
                  When he raped her she was a virgin.
                  Then they gave her pills. Semyon
                  has to be the father!

     Kirill suddenly goes for her over the bonnet of the car....

                           NIKOLAI
                   (in Russian))
               She's a civilian!

     Kirill pushes Anna up against the car, but she fights him.

                           ANNA
               She was fourteen!      She was a child!

     Kirill slaps Anna hard.     Nikolai grabs Kirill and pulls
     him away.

                           KIRILL
               You don't use my father's name!
               You don't say that filth about
               him...

     He goes for Anna again, and this time Nikolai shoves Kirill
     to the wet ground. He looks up at Nikolai and slowly gets
     to his feet. He wipes his hands then stares into Nikolai's
     eyes.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               Don't even look at her any more.

     Headlights from a passing car sweep the scene....

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               That's an order.

     Nikolai peers at Anna for a moment.     Anna's voice is defiant
     but cracking with fear.

                           ANNA
               Tell him what I said.

     Nikolai has taken what Anna said on board.        He speaks
     softly...

                           NIKOLAI
               There is nothing to tell.      Slaves
               give birth to slaves...

     Kirill yells....

                           KIRILL
               Come on Nikolai!!

     He turns to Anna...

               cock inside it! Understand? Maybe
               that's what you want!

     He offers the lights of the restaurant to her as a vicious
     invitation.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               You want to come in?! Maybe we
               all get to fuck you....

     Anna stares back. Nikolai peers at her for a moment before
     grabbing Kirill and pulling him away towards the restaurant.

64   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                 64

     The place is winding up. Chefs and waiters are cleaning
     surfaces and dishes. The only still point is Semyon, who
     is cutting and wrapping the birthday cake in small parcels
     of golden paper. He works intensely and delicately at the
     back of the kitchen. Nikolai and Kirill enter. Kirill
     swigs a half-drunk glass of wine.

                           KIRILL
               That girl you fucked in front of
               me... you remember her? The
               Ukrainian bitch?

                              NIKOLAI
               No.

                           KIRILL
               So they kick down the door. These
               are ordinary fucking police. They
               ask for her by name and they take
               her away. Some fucking punter must
               have given them her name. What
               gives the police the right to take
               our women, huh?

     Semyon shoots Kirill a hard look: he's talking too much
     and too loudly. Kirill ignores the look.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               Hey Papa, I never seen so many old
               people in one place. Whose party

     Semyon works on for a moment then glances at Kirill.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Kirill, go down into the cellar
                  and bring up some brandy. Twelve
                  bottles.

     Kirill turns to leave.

                              KIRILL
                  Come on, Nikolai, help me.

                              SEMYON
                  No. He stays here.   I want to
                  talk business.

     A confused pause.     Kirill looks from Nikolai to his father.

                              KIRILL
                  What business?

     A pause as Kirill suddenly senses his exclusion.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Papa, what business? His business
                  is my business.

     Semyon stares at Kirill and Kirill knows the look.

                              SEMYON
                  Go to the cellar Kirill.   And take
                  your time.

     Kirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of
     his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast
     and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he
     goes.

     Semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of
     cutting the cake. Finally...

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Did you deal with the old man?

     Nikolai nods.

     A pause.     Semyon looks up and fixes Nikolai with a stare.

     A long moment. The thing Nikolai has been working for has
     finally happened. There seems to be little joy.

65   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. CELLAR - NIGHT                65

     The cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates
     of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As
     Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill
     singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case
     of brandy across the cellar floor.

     Kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a
     long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures
     at the brandy...

                           KIRILL
               My dad swapped a little Georgian
               girl for this stuff.

     Nikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the
     wall. Kirill joins him and swigs some more.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               Hey, don't feel bad. What happened
               up there is just how he is. He
               plays people against each other.
               That's all. I realize more and
               more what he's like. Here, drink
               to the Georgian girl...

     Kirill offers the bottle to Nikolai but he refuses.

     Nikolai decides to bite the bullet, get this news over
     with.

                  He offered me stars. I accepted

     A long pause. This is what Kirill wanted, but now it feels
     like a stab in the back. Finally Kirill swallows a huge
     swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai. He
     squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away.

                  things I have to teach you.

     Nikolai nods.    Kirill gets to his feet....

                  Yeah.

                               KIRILL
                  What?

     A pause.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  You think I don't know stuff you
                  don't know? I am vor by birth.
                  The stars are a birthmark for me...

                              NIKOLAI
                  I know, Kirill.

     Kirill is about to fly into a rage but Nikolai gets to his
     feet.

                              KIRILL
                  Where the fuck are you going?
                  We've got to celebrate. Help me
                  with these bottles.

     Nikolai heads for the steps.

                           NIKOLAI
               Your dad don't need the bottles
               any more.

     As Nikolai departs Kirill calls after him.

                           KIRILL
               Hey! We're still partners, right?
               Thunder and lightning!

     Nikolai climbs the steps. Kirill is left to swig his brandy
     and stare into the darkness. He wipes his eyes angrily
     with his sleeve.

66   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. TWO DAYS LATER - NIGHT         66

     Sweet Russian choral music covers the next four scenes.

     The street outside the restaurant is now flooding with
     rain. A Daimler and a Bentley are already parked. A large
     SUV pulls up and a hard-looking Russian man in his sixties
     (VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits
     and shades.

     He is greeted by a darker-looking man in his fifties (THE
     GYPSY) who has a fur coat around his shoulders. Semyon is
     waiting on the doorstep, dressed in a fine dark suit.

67   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         67

     The curtains are drawn against the rainy light. The Gypsy,
     Valery, Semyon and TWO OTHER RUSSIAN MEN are sitting in a
     line behind a restaurant table, like a judging panel.

     After a moment Nikolai enters, dressed in suit and tie for
     the biggest interview of his life.

     The vory behind the table greet him.

     Then Nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie. He
     then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is
     decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow).

     He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits
     down. The panel of the vory study his body, the Gypsy
     pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the
     detail of the tattoos. Only after the men have studied
     the tattoos does the interview begin.

     The following dialogue should not be translated, and can
     be cut around to suggest a long and grueling interview.

                              VALERY
                  We can see that you were in prison
                  in Siberia. And that you were a
                  thief.

                              NIKOLAI
                  My father was a government worker.
                  He fixed the cars of officials. I
                  began by selling the spare parts
                  when I was fifteen.

                              VALERY
                  You have no forced tattoos?

                                 NIKOLAI
                  None.

                              GYPSY
                  You were not co-operative?

                              NIKOLAI
                  I spent two years in the punishment
                  block.

                              VALERY
                  You went through the Crosses in
                  St. Petersburg?

                              NIKOLAI
                  I was in solitary confinement
                  fifteen times. I was called 'The
                  Stump' because they couldn't shift
                  me.

                              VALERY
                  Your father was a bitch and a weak
                  fucker for working with the
                  Government, that's right isn't it?

     Nikolai flickers a little.

                              NIKOLAI
                  That's right. My father means
                  nothing to me. My Mother....

                              GYPSY
                  You have no mother.      She was a
                  whore anyway.

                           NIKOLAI
               Yes. I have no mother and no
               father. There is only the code,
               the vory v zakone code which I
               have always followed.

                           VALERY
               That is why there is an empty place
               above your heart. Where the stars
               will go. And why there is an empty
               place on your knees.

                           NIKOLAI
               I am dead already. I died when I
               was fifteen. Now I live in the
               zone all the time.

                           GYPSY
               You have never worked for the
               government? Any government?

                           NIKOLAI
               I have lived off Albanians and
               Georgians. I steal from them within
               the law.

     The questions and answers are delivered with great
     solemnity, making the ceremony feel almost religious.
     Candles burn, the men all sip water.

     Semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively.
     Towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a
     smile on the Gypsy's face and this pleases Semyon.

68   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT         68

     A wizened old Russian man (THE TATTOOIST) arrives at the
     kitchen door, carrying a battered leather case. The kitchen
     door is opened as he arrives and Semyon greets him.

69   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        69

     The choral music continues as we see the old man opening
     his case and pulling out tattooing equipment.

     Nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back, wearing
     only his underpants. We circle Nikolai as the tattooist
     begins to work on his knees, preparing Nikolai's knee caps
     for the tattoos.

     The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist
     wipes away the blood.

     Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above
     Nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol.

     Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight-
     pointed stars on his chest. He is now a member of the vory
     v zakone.

70   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - MORNING                   70

     Anna is lying awake, her curtains drawn against the
     daylight. Helen knocks and enters with a cup of tea, just
     as in the opening scenes. Anna sits up.

                              HELEN
                      (almost accusing)
                  Have you slept at all?

     Anna doesn't answer.    Helen looks anxious as she peeks out
     of the curtains.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  I tried to get hold of Stepan for
                  you.

     A pause.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  He's usually either at home or at
                  his sisters. But she hasn't heard
                  from him at all.

     Helen is trying to hide her anxiety but Anna sees it.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  He did spit in that horrible man's
                  face.

                              ANNA
                  I don't think the driver would do
                  anything to Stepan.

     Helen knows Anna well, senses some flicker of attraction.

                              HELEN
                  How do you know what he would do?

     A pause.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  You haven't spoken to him since,
                  have you?

     Anna doesn't answer and Helen's anger sparks... She leaves
     and slams the door.

71   EXT. TURKISH BATHS - DAY                                        71

     We are in St. Pancras, North London.

     More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his
     hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a
     Victorian red-brick edifice.

     Nikolai pulls up in his Mercedes.

72   INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY                         72

     Ozim and Nikolai are undressing. The place is deserted
     apart from an OLD TURKISH BATH-HOUSE ATTENDANT who is
     distributing towels. Ozim is unbuttoning his shirt.

                              OZIM
                  Semyon recommends these places for
                  business meetings because you can
                  see what tattoos a man has.

     Nikolai is pulling off his shirt and Ozim reacts to the
     sight of the fresh eight-pointed star tattoos. Ozim
     chuckles.

                              OZIM (CONT'D)
                  Come on. We have a lot to get
                  through. Let's cook.

     Ozim disappears into a steam room, naked. Nikolai watches
     him go, a private agenda bubbling beneath the surface.

74   INT. TURKISH BATHS. STEAM ROOM - DAY                           74

     Ozim and Nikolai sit side by side, sweating.    There is no
     one else in the steam room.

                           OZIM
               Our lines to Kabul get broken every
               two or three weeks.

                             NIKOLAI
               How come?

                           OZIM
               The Americans. Fucking NATO.
                   (pause)
               Valery Nabokov imports flowers and
               television sets into this country.
               The television sets are one in
               ten. That means one in ten have
               cargo inside them.

                           NIKOLAI
               Where do they dock?

     Ozim grins.

                           OZIM
               I will tell you when I return from
               the bathroom.

     Ozim chuckles as he leaves in a swirl of steam. Nikolai
     leans back against the cold wall, his tattoo almost the
     only visible thing through the steam.

75   INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY                        75

     Ozim is dressing frantically, his face suddenly betraying
     his real anxiety. He checks his watch as he puts it back
     on his wrist.

     After a moment the two Chechen brothers who killed Ekrem
     enter the changing room. They swagger up to Ozim.

     He gulps down his fear.

                              OZIM
                  Kirill is in there.

     Ozim slaps his chest to denote the place where they will
     see the vor tattoo. They head towards the steam room as
     Ozim grabs his shoes and hurries towards the exit.

76   INT. TURKISH BATHS. STEAM ROOM - DAY                         76

     Nikolai is sweating hard, staring at the ceiling. The
     steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he
     can't see who has entered.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Ozim?

     He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately.
     Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a
     head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if
     this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an
     instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with
     an open razor.

     Nikolai is naked, alone.

     Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a
     martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother.
     In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and
     fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one
     brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously
     has serious combat training but the brothers are strong
     and angry.

     Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor
     and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men
     are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water.
     Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the
     men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final
     surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a
     blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the
     temple.

     As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the
     bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes
     their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor,
     and staggers out of the steam room.

78   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A AND E DEPARTMENT. CANTEEN - DAY      78

     Aziz and a group of a dozen doctors and nurses are eating
     lunch, some in party hats, some drinking red wine out of
     paper cups. Aziz seems anxious, distracted. Anna enters in
     a hurry, locates Aziz and joins him.

                            ANNA
                I'm so late. Sorry.

     She looks around the 'party' with horror...

                It's fine, although I think I've
                had enough.

     He smiles and downs his glass of wine in one go.

                            ANNA
                Paul, on my way here I made a
                decision.

                            AZIZ
                    (mock horror)
                You can't possibly dump me. We're
                not even going out.

                            ANNA
                Take my hand.

     Aziz, confused, takes her hand.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                Feel my pulse.

     Aziz feels Anna's pulse.      Anna takes a deep breath.

                I'm going to apply to adopt

                                AZIZ
                  Yes, I can.

79   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A AND E DEPARTMENT - DAY                79

     Nikolai is being hurried down the corridor, his face covered
     with an oxygen mask. He is covered with a surgical gown
     which is covered in blood. His arm flops out from under
     the covers as the paramedics rush him into the hospital.

     Anna is walking in the opposite direction. Then, as
     Nikolai's trolley passes, Anna sees Nikolai's arm, flopping
     from under the covers. She sees the eagle tattoo on the
     back of his hand. Anna freezes.

80   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - DAY              80

     Nikolai is conscious in bed, attached to a single drip.
     His wounds have been stitched up.

     A doctor and two nurses are settling Nikolai's vital signs,
     moving around him, checking his temperature. Finally they
     clear the bed and through the glass of the room we see
     Anna, standing outside, staring in at Nikolai.

81   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - NIGHT            81

     Nikolai is peering through half-opened eyes. The last
     nurse is checking his vital signs. Then Anna enters. The
     nurse stops work...

                                NURSE
                  Anna?

                              ANNA
                  Is it OK to talk to him for a
                  minute?

     The nurse hesitates...

                              NURSE
                  He's still in trauma.   Do you know
                  him?

     Anna glances at Nikolai who is rousing himself.

                                 ANNA
                  Yes.

     The nurse is reluctant but sees Anna's fierce stare and
     finally leaves. After she has gone Nikolai stirs, focuses
     on her face.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I thought you did birth.

     Nikolai smiles, but Anna is trying hard to even out her
     fear and anger.

                                 ANNA
                  My uncle....

     Nikolai tries to sit up and registers pain.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...the one who spat in your face...
                  He's disappeared.

     A pause. Nikolai gasps in pain as he raises himself up.
     Anna sees the wounds on his arms and glimpses the tattoos
     on his chest, scaring her even more.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  If we don't hear from him soon
                  we're going to the police...

     Nikolai reaches for a bottle of water and manages to take
     a swig. Anna is impatient for a reaction.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Do you know where he is?

     A pause. Nikolai finishes the bottle of water in one
     thirsty swig. Finally...

                                 NIKOLAI
                  Yes.

     A pause.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  He's in Scotland. In Edinburgh.
                  In a five-star hotel.

     Anna is locating the door in case she has to flee as Nikolai
     swings his legs out of the bed to stretch his painful limbs.

                             NIKOLAI
                I'm going to need some clothes. I
                arrived here without any. Can you
                get me some?

     Anna doesn't budge.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                I can't walk out of here naked.

                            ANNA
                You can't walk out of here because
                you're attached to a drip. Explain
                Edinburgh.

     Nikolai sighs, sits back down on the bed.    He finally speaks
     softly.

                            NIKOLAI
                Your uncle knew too much.

     Nikolai shrugs.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                I was told to get rid of him. I
                was meant to send him to heaven
                with a bullet in his head. Instead
                I sent him to Edinburgh. With a
                first-class ticket.

     A pause.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                He is of the old school. He
                understood the situation. Exile
                or death. Edinburgh was his idea.
                He said they throw a great party
                at New Year. And he said it was a
                good excuse to get away from his
                family.

     Nikolai smiles at Anna.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                So... just a pair of jeans and a T-
                shirt. A jacket. And some shoes.

     Anna still looks disbelieving.   Nikolai sighs.

82   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -82
     NIGHT

     Anna is sitting on the bed beside Christine's crib.
     Christine is asleep. Anna is speaking into her cell phone,
     trying to keep her voice down.

                            ANNA
                    (into phone)
                ...no, I couldn't get much sense
                out of him, he was drunk.

     A pause.   Anna looks exasperated.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone)
                Mum, I don't want to tell you how
                I found him because I don't want
                another argument. I just wanted
                you to know he's definitely safe...

     Anna listens with weariness.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone)
                No, we can't tonight. I'm working.
                I need the money.
                    (a pause)
                For a place of my own, for Christ's
                sake!

     She listens with growing anger until she finally cuts the
     call without a word. Christine stirs but doesn't wake.

     She leans back against the wall, already regretful.

83   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL.    WARD OUTSIDE NIKOLAI'S ROOM -      83
     NEXT MORNING.

     The ward is busy as Yuri, the police specialist from the
     Russian desk, enters wearing a heavy overcoat. He looks
     all around and approaches a nurse.
     PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                          89.




84   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - MORNING       84

     Nikolai's drip is being removed by A NURSE. Nikolai is
     examining his healing wounds. Then through the glass of
     the door he notices Yuri, speaking to a nurse, and obviously
     recognizes him.

     The nurse points Yuri in Nikolai's direction.

85   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - MORNING      85

     It's cold and the wind is blowing. We see rooftops behind
     them. Yuri is lighting Nikolai's cigarette. Nikolai is
     wearing Yuri's overcoat loosely over his hospital gown.
     Yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence
     for a moment.

                           NIKOLAI
               You got my message?

     Yuri chuckles.

                            YURI
               Using a dead body to file a progress
               report must be against FSB
               regulations.

                           NIKOLAI
               It's called improvisation.

                           YURI
               You've been improvising quite a
               lot lately. And taking risks.

     He glances at the cuts on Nikolai's hands...

                           YURI (CONT'D)
                   (in Russian)
               Maybe too many.

     Nikolai suddenly glares at Yuri.

                           NIKOLAI
                   (in Russian)
               You didn't come here to give me
               flowers...

     Yuri shakes his head and prepares to deliver bad news.
     Nikolai turns as if to go back inside. Yuri grabs Nikolai's
     arm and speaks formally....

                  ...and in light of other violent
                  incidents associated with you, the
                  Russian desk at Scotland Yard have
                  made an official request to the
                  Russian embassy that your undercover
                  operation in London be terminated.

     Nikolai doesn't react for a moment.

                              YURI (CONT'D)
                      (in Russian)
                  You have gone beyond what was
                  agreed.

     With his cigarette dangling from his mouth Nikolai begins
     to unbutton his overcoat..

                              YURI (CONT'D)
                  In my opinion you should see this
                  as good news. You've been in the
                  zone far too long...

     Nikolai turns and slowly pulls open the overcoat and the
     thin hospital gown beneath it.

     He reveals the eight-pointed star tattoos on his chest and
     Yuri reacts with absolute astonishment.

                              YURI (CONT'D)
                  My God...

                              NIKOLAI
                  If they terminate the operation
                  now, they will be wasting this...

     A pause. Yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified.
     Nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got
     this far. After a long silence Nikolai mumbles.

     A pause.   Yuri is still overwhelmed.

                            YURI
                They are bound to ask... who did
                you kill?

                    (in Russian)
                Tell them I only killed myself.

     understanding as they smoke. Finally...

                And you can tell them I'm going to

                London organization.

     Yuri laughs.

                            YURI
                What drugs are they giving you?
                Maybe it's the anesthetic speaking.

                I need you to take Semyon out of
                the picture. I want you to arrest
                him.

     Nikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one
     he is smoking. Yuri is incredulous.

                            YURI
                Arrest him for what?

                              NIKOLAI

     Yuri begins to chuckle.

                The girl was fourteen.

                She doesn't have to.   She's dead.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                But she had Semyon's baby. If you
                prove the baby is his and prove
                the girl was under age when the
                baby was conceived, that's statutory
                rape.

     A pause.   Yuri begins it think it through.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                All you need is the baby and some
                of Semyon's DNA. For poetic reasons
                I suggest you take his blood.

     Yuri peers at Nikolai with awe.    A long pause.   Finally
     Yuri smiles.

                You intrigue me.

                If we had never had this

     Yuri tenderly takes his overcoat from Nikolai's shoulders
     and goes back through the fire-escape door. Nikolai is
     left cold and exposed in his thin gown.

86   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - DAY             86

     Nikolai is playing chess against himself, sitting on the
     bed, trying hard to concentrate. There is a knock and
     Anna enters, carrying an old shopping bag. She takes out
     a worn pair of jeans and a T-shirt, a denim jacket and a

     Instead of answering, Anna lays the clothes on the bed.

                            ANNA
                    (deadpan)
                They're from the morgue. They
                belonged to someone who died
                yesterday.

     Nikolai picks up the jeans and examines them.     They're way
     too big.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                I can't believe I'm doing a favor
                for someone just because he had
                the decency not to murder a member
                of my family.

     Nikolai smiles but Anna turns to leave...

                            NIKOLAI
                Hey... wait a minute...

     Nikolai steps behind the bed screen to pull on the jeans.
     He speaks from behind the screen.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                Is your bike still working OK?

     A pause.   Anna considers leaving but hesitates.

                               ANNA
                Yeah.     It's OK.

     Nikolai steps out from behind the screen, the baggy jeans
     tightly belted, his chest bare. For the first time Anna
     sees the extent of Nikolai's body tattoos and reacts....

     Nikolai sees her reaction to the tattoos and doesn't care
     for it. He grabs the T-shirt and pulls it on.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Did you get in touch with Tatiana's
                  family in Russia?

                              ANNA
                  No.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Good.

     Nikolai is now dressed, his cut and tattooed arms still
     showing.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  So the baby's still in England.

     A pause.   Anna nods.

                              ANNA
                  She's staying here for good.

     They peer at each other.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Why do you care?

     Nikolai shrugs and grabs the shoes.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Stepan said you were kind to him.
                  He said you were risking your own
                  life to keep him alive.

     Nikolai laughs.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Yeah, and all the thanks I get is
                  a pair of dead man's shoes.

87   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                         87

     The restaurant is filled with balloons of every color, all
     over the floor and bouncing off the tables. A large `Happy
     New Year' banner is hanging from the wall.

     Kirill is sitting on the floor amongst the balloons, blowing
     up another one. Maria, Semyon's little granddaughter, runs
     in to the restaurant and stops to stare at Kirill. He
     begins to inflate another balloon then stops.

                           KIRILL
                   (in Russian)
               What are you looking at?

                      (in Russian)
               You.

     Maria comes to him and take a balloon. She tries to blow
     it up but fails. Kirill smiles and blows it up for her.

                           MARIA (CONT'D)
               What were you and Grandpa shouting
               about last night?

                           KIRILL
               Nothing, baby.

                           MARIA
               It sounded like something.

     Kirill takes a deep breath to blow a balloon then stops
     and looks at Maria.

                           KIRILL
               Someone I know got hurt and I blamed
               Grandpa.

                           MARIA
               Did you fight each other?    I heard
               banging.

                  you doesn't fight back.

     A pause.     Kirill smiles.   We see slight abrasions.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  So, today I do as I am told.

     She nods and Kirill blows another balloon. At that moment
     Kirill sees on the security monitor behind the bar that a
     police car is pulling up outside the restaurant. His face
     clouds as another pulls up beside it.

                               KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Maria.   Go upstairs.

88   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                            88

     Semyon sits at a bare table, opposite Yuri from the Russian
     desk. A uniformed officer stands nearby, and there is a
     police doctor with a medical bag sitting at the next table,
     waiting. The whole scene is rendered surreal by all the
     balloons which bounce around them. Semyon is in full
     charming old man mode.

                              SEMYON
                      (in Russian)
                  You'll have a drink, Yuri...

     He is half on his feet.

     Yuri shakes his head.     Semyon goes to the optic and helps
     himself to a vodka.

                  So what is all this nonsense?

                              YURI
                  We just need a blood sample.

                                   SEMYON

                  We can take the sample right now
                  voluntarily or I can get an order
                  from the court. It's up to you.

     Semyon glances at the doctor and chuckles.

                  Semyon?

     Semyon's face hardens and he glares at Yuri.

                              SEMYON
                  I am afraid of... conspiracies.

     A pause.     Yuri speaks softly.

                              YURI
                  I will return tomorrow with a court
                  order.

     He gets to his feet.

                  Wait.       I've done nothing wrong.

     Semyon begins to roll up his sleeve, revealing a long scroll
     of tattoos.

     Then a needle is being pushed into Semyon's arm by the
     doctor. Semyon's face doesn't flicker. He stares into
     Yuri's eyes.

89   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                    89

     Kirill is preparing food for the night's festivities.
     Semyon enters and goes straight to the sink. He pulls off
     the plaster from his arm where the blood was taken and
     pours some vodka over the tiny puncture hole.

                           KIRILL
               What did they want with you, papa?

                           SEMYON
               To poison me.

     Semyon pours more vodka on the wound then takes a swig.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               They took blood from me with a
               needle. Probably the same needle
               they use for all the junkies and
               whores and blacks and queers.

     He glares at Kirill as he rolls his sleeve down.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               Now I probably have the fucking
               queer disease.

     Kirill has his back turned, doesn't react.   Semyon sits
     heavily. Finally...

                           KIRILL
               Why would they want your blood,
               papa?

     For the first time Semyon looks vulnerable and confused as
     he admits....

                           SEMYON
               I don't know.

     Kirill is surprised to see his father unsure.   He peers at
     him.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               Someone is ahead of me. I don't
               like people ahead of me.

     Kirill is now unnerved by Semyon's quiet confusion. He
     watches as Semyon grabs at the bottle of vodka to drink.
     He speaks softly as he swigs.

     his arm.

     Semyon stares into Kirill's eyes and Kirill mistakes his
     frantic thought process for anger. Kirill backs away.
     Semyon is beginning to catch up.

90   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL - NIGHT                               90

     The main entrance of the hospital is busy with visitors
     and staff. There is a `Happy New Year' banner across the
     entrance. In amongst the bustle of visitors we spy a young
     man with his collar turned up and a bunch of red roses in
     his hand.

     We then see that it is Kirill, entering the hospital.

     We are close on Kirill's face as he studies a map of the
     hospital near the elevators.

     Anna comes down a stairwell and spots Kirill - she
     especially notices the roses - just as he gets into an
     elevator. The elevator doors close. Was it really him?
     Anna is not sure. She frowns.

     A door opens and Kirill steps into striped moonlight.
     Clamping the roses under his arm, he pulls a black zip-up
     sports bag from under his coat. After a brief dialogue
     with himself, he produces a half bottle of vodka and takes
     a swig. Then he hurries on.

     Anna walks onto the ward in her uniform. She checks a few
     stats as she walks by various beds. She then glances over
     at Christine's private room. She tiptoes into the room
     and goes to the crib. She finds it empty - except for a
     bunch of red roses. Outside the ward is now filling up
     with visitors. Babies cry, people laugh.

     Anna goes back out to the ward and calls to a nurse.

     Anna runs at breakneck speed through the corridors.

97   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. CAR PARK - NIGHT                    97

     Kirill is at the wheel of Nikolai's Mercedes. He swigs
     from his bottle of vodka, which is now more than half empty.
     He fires the engine and reverses. A car passing by has to
     slam on its brakes. Kirill yells.

                           KIRILL
               Hey, you stupid fucker!!

     A horn blows. The passing car accelerates angrily by. Then
     we hear a baby crying. Kirill looks into the half darkness
     of the back seat and we see Kirill's black sports bag,
     partially zipped up. Christine is crying inside it, her
     little grasping hand protruding past the zipper. Kirill
     speaks softly.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               Be quiet baby. Quiet baby.    It's
               OK.

98   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD OUTSIDE NIKOLAI'S ROOM -        98
     NIGHT

     Anna flies out of Nikolai's room and spots a nurse.

                           ANNA
               What happened to the patient with
               the knife cuts? The Russian?

                           NURSE
               We just discharged him.   A couple
               of minutes ago.

     Anna runs out.

99   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. RECEPTION - NIGHT                    99

     Anna runs fast down the corridor towards the hospital exit.
     She spots Nikolai ahead of her.

     She pushes past a couple of drunks and flies at him.

                           ANNA
               Where have they taken Christine?!

     Nikolai reacts.

                           ANNA (CONT'D)
               You bastards!! Where will he take
               her?! Tell me!!

     People back away as Nikolai grabs Anna's arms and holds
     her still.

                           NIKOLAI
               What are you talking about?!

     Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion.
     She calms down a little.

                           ANNA
               Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine.
               I saw him here! I thought he was
               coming to see you, but he wasn't,
               was he?

     Nikolai curses under his breath and thinks fast.

                           NIKOLAI
               You brought your bike?

100    EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT                        100

       The same dockside where Nikolai dumped Soyka and recommended
       this as the best place to dispose of a body. Kirill pulls
       up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes. The car is parked for a
       long time before finally the headlights are switched off.

101    EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. MATERNITY UNIT - NIGHT               101

       Nikolai and Anna race to Anna's motorbike.

                               NIKOLAI
                 I'll drive.

                               ANNA
                 I'll drive.

       Anna and Nikolai leap aboard the bike and it starts first
       time. With Nikolai riding pillion, they roar away.

101A   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                    101A

       Anna and Nikolai ride through London streets.

102    EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT                        102

       On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the
       zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst
       over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight.

       Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine
       stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.

                             KIRILL
                 She's a little girl, Papa, a little
                 sweet fucking girl...

       Kirill sobs then Christine cries...

                             KIRILL (CONT'D)
                 Shush, shush...

       Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to
       him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He
       looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused.
       He whispers...

                             KIRILL (CONT'D)
                     (in Russian)
                 I'm sorry, my little sister.

      For a moment we believe he is going to throw her into the
      water. Instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her
      crying stops.

      Then we see a single light behind him. In a firework flash
      we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike. They
      approach cautiously. Kirill stares at the man he loves.
      A pause. Christine begins to cry.

                             ANNA
                 Kirill, let me take the baby.

                             KIRILL
                 You stay where you are.

                             ANNA
                 She's cold, Kirill.

      Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks
      explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously
      close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself
      in too.

                             NIKOLAI
                 Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little
                 babies.

      Kirill is motionless.

                             NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                 Something like this would be bad
                 for all of us. Your dad has gone
                 too far, Kirill.

      A pause.

                             NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                     (in Russian)
                 It's our turn now.

      Nikolai steps forward slowly.    As he gets closer Kirill
      hugs the baby.

      Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does
      he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are
      locked in a long embrace.

      Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his
      arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close.
      Kirill turns to Nikolai.

                             KIRILL
                 I swear I didn't know my dad was
                 setting you up.

                               NIKOLAI
                   He's going away. When he's gone
                   the family business will be yours.

      A pause.

                               NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   We can be partners again. Thunder
                   and lightning, right?

      Kirill smiles through his tears and nods.

                               NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   Get into the car. I'll drive you
                   home.

      A pause. Kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car.
      Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby. He waits
      a long time before realizing he must leave her.

                               NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   You're OK, yeah?

      Anna nods.

                               ANNA
                   Who are you really? Why have you
                   helped us?

      Nikolai can't answer truthfully, though he longs to do so.
      There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable
      lie.

                             NIKOLAI
                 How can I become King if the King
                 is still in place?

      A pause.   He laughs.

      Anna studies him, unsure. More New Year fireworks explode
      over the river. Kirill yells from the car...

                             KIRILL
                 You come on, Nikolai! We're missing
                 the fucking party of the year out
                 there!! Get here and drive!!
                     (in Russian)
                 That's a fucking order!!

      Nikolai and Anna peer at each other.

                             NIKOLAI
                 Maybe I can drive you somewhere?

      She shakes her head.

                             ANNA
                 There's someone I can call.   He'll
                 come and fetch us.

      Nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it.
      Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christine's face.
      He smiles. Kirill is hooting the car horn.

      After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently
      before Nikolai heads for the car.

104   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                             104*

      A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing
      to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation
      is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the
      table.

      Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and
      lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to
      Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana
      in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.

                            TATIANA (V.O.)
                My name is Tatiana. My father
                died in the mines in my village,
                so he was already buried when he
                died...

      Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to
      peer outside, staring across the park.

105   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - SAME DAY                     105

      Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka,
      staring back across the park. He peers out at ordinary
      life going on in the streets outside. Tatiana's V.O.
      continues...

                            TATIANA (V.O.)
                We were all buried there. Beneath
                the soil of Russia. That is why I
                left to find a better life.

      Nikolai finishes his drink.

              a game of softball.
 
              In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.  CLAUDETTE is 17
              years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant
              Counsellor" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well.
 
              Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks
              quickly in the opposite direction.

                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Have you seen Barry?

              BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
              behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
              and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
              cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
              an Everly Brothers hit.
 
              BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not
              ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      We've got to talk.
 
              BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Okay.
 
         5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his
              shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.
 
              The Everly Brothers continue as we:

                                  CLAUDETTE
                      You said we were special.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I meant everything.
 
              In the BG, CHILDREN leap into the water.

                            (continuing)
                      You know what I said, though.

              The TRACK goes SILENT.
 
              BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path.  This is not an aimless
              walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.  He leaves
              the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
              CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I care very much.
 
              He puts an arm around her and draws her close.  They kiss.
              They separate.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
 
              BARRY decides to be politic.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I wouldn't know.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Oh, you...
 
              She kisses him and they are locked.
 
              A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
 
              The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE:  Just beyond the thicket of
              lacy vines.  It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
 
              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
 
              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
              breast.  She reaches up to take his hand away.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Claudette...

                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Somebody'll see.
 
                                  BARRY
                      No, they won't...
 
              He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
              that part of her bra is exposed.  He seals her protesting lips
              by kissing her.
 
              From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
              A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
              the field of vision.  A branch pops.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                            (in a thick whisper)
                      Somebody's there, Barry.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Come on, Claudette.  A man's not made of
                      stone.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Let's go back, Barry...
 
                                  BARRY
                      I need you so much, Claudette.
 
              BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.  They kiss again,
              passionately.
 
              The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
              foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
              the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
 
              Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It
              swells.  Closer.
 
              QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
              perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
 
              Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
 
              A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
              blow.
 
              The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him
              by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
 
              A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.

              BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to
              the mossy floor of the clearing.
 
              Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it.
 
              There is a confused jumble of struggle.
 
              Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight.
 
              The PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward.
              We can hear the blade strike.
 
              BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
 
              MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into
              FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
 
              QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.
              She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her
              temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC
              has stopped abruptly.
 
              THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.
 
              It is completely SILENT.

              The screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to
              ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional
              rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final
              position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane
              of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper
              left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
 
              The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the
              Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.
 
              TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out.

              We can begin to hear a small-town DJ OVER as a pick-up truck
              moves down the street past the GIRL in her late teens.  She has
              a knapsack, a freshly scrubbed face, jeans, and a plaid shirt.

              The radio is turned way down.  We see that the hand belongs to
              TRUDY, a hefty waitress who wears her golden hair in a bun with
              a pencil stuck in it.  BUDDY, the boss, is seen in the BG
              working the grill.

              The regulars are there:  five MEN and two WOMEN who always come
              in for breakfast.  They are the retailers, the oil delivery
              man, the switchboard operators, and the cop.
 
              ANNIE walks in the front door, crosses the past the cash
              register and walks down the counter.

              ANNIE is beginning to get worried about the time.  It's hot and
              she's late.
 
              She looks up.
 
              From her POV a Jeep barrels along the road towards us.
 
              ANNIE puts out her numb.

              From the DRIVER'S POV, we see ANNIE waiting for a lift.  The
              DRIVER, unseen, shifts down until ANNIE is alongside.  The
              Jeep, an uncovered model, stops.  ANNIE smiles a big delicious
              smile at us as we sit in the DRIVER's seat.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      Hiya!  I'm headed for Camp Crystal Lake.
                      Can you help me out?
 
              Apparently the DRIVER nods, because ANNIE beams at us.  She
              tosses her pack in the back and hops aboard.  The DRIVER
              accelerates.

              The Jeep roars along the road.  The sun and shadows keep us
              from seeing the DRIVER.

              Still in the DRIVER's POV, the CAMERA watches as ANNIE looks
              around, admires the woods, the Jeep, the day.  Things are going
              her way.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      I can't remember being this excited
                      about anything.  I want to be a teacher
                      when I finish at Southern State.  I
                      guess I've always wanted to work with
                      children.  I hate it when people call
                      'em kids.  Sounds like little goats.
 
              The forest outside the speeding Jeep is deeper and signs of
              civilization have all but disappeared.  ANNIE still turns and
              looks at the CAMERA when she speaks to the DRIVER.
 
                                  ANNIE
                            (continuing)
                      The job market for teachers is supposed
                      to be the pits these days, but I don't
                      care.  When you have a dream as long as
                      I have, you'll do anything...
 
              A look of surprise passes ANNIE's young face.
 
                                  ANNIE
                            (continuing)
                      Wasn't that Camp Crystal Lake?  Just
                      back there?

                            (frightened, confused)
                      I think we better stop... Please stop...
                      Please!  Stop!
 
              The Jeep's speed increases.
 
                                  ANNIE
                            (continuing)
                      Please!
 
              ANNIE grabs for the ignition key, but the DRIVER's hand darts
              out and slaps ANNIE away.  We see that this hand is missing its
              little finger!
 
              Panicked, without any other recourse, ANNIE looks about her and
              then leaps from the moving Jeep, aiming for the relatively soft
              underbrush alongside the narrow road.

              ANNIE lands, rolls, is upended, scratched by brambles, and

              the camp.

              ANNIE's feet pound the hard-packed dirt.  She looks over her
              shoulder to see the Jeep.  The sun flares on the Jeep's
              windshield, keeping us from being able to see any details of
              the DRIVER.

              In a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to
              escape.
 
              The Jeep skids to a stop.

              Branches and briars snap back at us.  Just ahead, the terror-
              stuck ANNIE stumbles and falls.  She screams as a knife flashes
              past her in a blur.
 
              When the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise
              on ANNIE's face.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Her throat has been cut.  She collapses
              out of FRAME.
 
              A bird soars across the sky above.
 
              The TRACK is SILENT.

              A gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway.  We
              hear rock 'n roll OVER coming from a car radio as this much-in-
              need-of-repair vehicle passes a slower car.

        27    INT. CAMPER VAN - DAY
 
              In the camper van are three young people.  They are full of
              fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake.
              They are instantly likeable.
 
              At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed
              upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice-
              looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction.
              He is funny and alert.
 
              Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as
              American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not
              as smart as NED.  He has to think things through.
 
              MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front
              passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.

              She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She
              enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by
              tragedy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
 
                                  NED
                      There you are dead wrong.
 
                                  JACK
                      Ha!
 
                                  NED
                      Sometimes I only think about kissing
                      women.
 
              MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.
 
                                  JACK
                      Ow!
 
                                  NED
                      I was just wondering if you thought
                      there'd by any other gorgeous women at
                      Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      You are a true pierce of work, Ned.
 
              MARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      How about our last jay?
 
                                  JACK
                      Good call.
 
              JACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a
              joint.
 
                                  NED
                      What about the dope paragraph in Mr.
                      Christy's letter?
 
                                  JACK

                      We got two weeks before the kids even
                      arrive.  Then I'll act responsibly.
                      Until then, hit me.
 
              She takes the lighted joint and tokes.

              time has torn the place badly.

              large overhanging tree.
 
              In the BG we can see part of the lake.

              An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of
              a huge tree stump.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs,
              a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.  This is
              STEVE CHRISTY.  He is strong, charming, and engaging.  He is
              animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to
              do things.
 
              In the BG the van comes to a stop.  No sooner has JACK hopped
              down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.

              NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had
              polio when he was a kid.  His upper body is strong, but his
              legs are slightly deformed.  He and MARCIE hustle over to the
              big stump.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
                      Alice?
 
              ALICE comes into the MS.  She is carrying a shovel and a bucket
              and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Cabin B is ready.

                      Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack,
                      Marcie and Ned.  Push.
 
              They exchange "hellos" as they bend to the work.

                      That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve
                      Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
                      You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into
                      'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out
                      the boathouse.  I want him to start with
                      the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?
 
                                  ALICE
                      You told her to sweep the courts.
 
              STEVE sets off.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.
 
              As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      I thought we had two weeks...
 
              ALICE shrugs.

              The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull
              up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing
              a coat of paint on the last canoe.
 
              BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his
              long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone
              call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the
              trail.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Steve said for you to start on the boats.
 
                                  BILL
                      I finished the boats.

                      I'll tell him.
 
              She turns away.

                                  BILL
                      Alice?  The others show up?

                      Everybody except the girl who's supposed
                      to handle the kitchen.  Annie.
 
              BILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps.
 
              ALICE look at him, then turns again.

                      I'm not sure I'll last all week.

        34    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - DAY
 
              STEVE and NED are rehanging a door.  Next to them is BRENDA, a
              dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting
              the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking
              paint.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Shim it up just a scooch.
 
              NED levers the door higher at the top.

                            (continuing)
                      Perfection.  Hold it.
 
              STEVE uses a long ratchet screwdriver.

                            (continuing)
                      To answer your question, my parents once
                      owned this camp.  There were some tragic
                      accidents and they went bankrupt.  I
                      promised them I'd reopen if I could.
                      See if it closes right now.
 
              NED swings the door on its hinges.
 
                                  NED
                      Looks good.

              BRENDA turns and nods.

                      I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned.
 
              They exit with the tool box.  MARCIE stops and turns to BRENDA,
              who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead.

              STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a
              swimming float down to the water's edge.  STEVE supervises as
              he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.  They ad-lid as
              appropriate.  ("There goes my hernia." "Are you sure you're
              lifting?" "Not so fast." "I'm walking backward.")
 
              They drop the things carefully.

                      Come on back here and let's above the
                      float in.
 
              They get behind it and shove it into the water.  NED hops
              aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.

              The screen has gone completely black.  The door to the shed is
              whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the
              sun.  There is a shape.
 
              The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in
              on an errand.
 
              As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there
              are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple
              of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,
              etc.  Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives
              in sheathes, also hanging neatly.
 
              Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the
              shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.  JACK turns with
              a start.  He looks into the CAMERA.

              REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      What are those for?  An Indian raid?
 
              She points to the row of hatchets and knives.
 
                                  JACK
                      Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see
                      any life rings?
 
              MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.  She pulls out two
              rings.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Here.  Meet me in my cabin after taps.
                      Okay, Camper?
 
              She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose.
 
                                  JACK
                      For sure.

              STEVE CHRISTY comes upon ALICE, who is renailing floorboards on
              the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  On the railing is a
              sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.
 
              INSERT:  ALICE'S SKETCH.  It is a moody pierce, a sense of
              foreboding dominates it.  Otherwise, it is the camp's central
              compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You draw very well.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more
                      time at it.
 
              ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.  She reacts good-
              naturedly and keeps on working.
 
              STEVE bends down next to ALICE.
 
                                  STEVE
                      This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?
 
              She shakes her head.

                            (continuing)
                      Any particular reason?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Just a feeling.
                            (pause)
                      Nothing personal.

                      I don't know.  Probably be best for
                      everybody.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You may not care a lot about this place,
                      Alice, but I mean to make it my whole
                      life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme
                      a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it
                      ready.  Next Friday, if you're not
                      happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.
                      I'll be grateful.
 
              He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.
 
              She looks up.  She nods.
 
                                  ALICE

                      Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the
                      archery range.  If Annie gets here, have

              BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She
              enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of
              this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated
              than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.
 
              BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter
              and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are
              already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.
              The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.
 
              The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets
              closer to setting up the target.
 
              In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the
              face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the
              weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow
              streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by
              eighteen inches.
 
              BRENDA whips around.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-
              to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked
              simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair.
 
              She grabs the arrow and storms at him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You're crazy!
 
              She snaps the arrow in half.

              BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's
              little she can do.  She laughs.

                      You ever fire one of those bows again,

              bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.

              This is a fairly large single room.  The walls are bare and

              the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.
 
              The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey
              wood interior appear silver-colored.  ALICE, her hair in a
              bandana, has just finished sweeping up.
 
              The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area
              on one easel.  On a second easel she has done the preliminary
              sketch of the lake itself.  It is also a moody picture.
 
              ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a
              little, then goes on to her next task.  There is a row of newly-
              arrived cardboard boxes.  She opens the first in CU with a
              matte knife.  She take out the invoice and checks it against
              the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the

                                  BILL
                      Sorry.  How you doing?
 
              ALICE smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory.
              BILL watches her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Did you want something?
 
              She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.  She doesn't
              realize that there is something on top of the box.
 
                                  BILL
                      Steve said you were thinking of leaving.
                      True?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Un-hunh.
 
              ALICE lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working
              tools clatters down, shattering the silence.  ALICE fends off
              the flying implements and BILL rushes to her side.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      Oh, my God...
 
                                  BILL
                      You okay?
 
              She nods.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      You're lucky.
 
              They stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor.
              BILL looks at her while they work.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      How come you're leaving?
 
                                  ALICE
                      It's long and personal.  It has nothing
                      to do with you or the other kids.
 
                                  BILL
                      Maybe I can help?
 
              ALICE looks at BILL and smiles.  This really is a very nice, if
              naive, young man.

                                  ALICE
                      And it's this place.  It makes no sense,
                      but it spooks me.
 
                                  BILL
                            (smiling)
                      You're right.  It makes no sense.
 
              As ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        43    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY
 
              MARCIE is the source of the scream.  She runs towards the
              CAMERA, dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter.  Her feet are
              bare.  When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by
              JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.  The
              screams were not serious and MARCIE is doing some of it for
              effect.  BRENDA brings up the rear.  They are all dressed more
              or less for a frolic in the lake.
 
              BILL and ALICE stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  BILL
              is smiling, ALICE is a little bit amused.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Help me!  Save me!  The frog people are
                      after me!  It's swim time at Camp Crystal
                      Lake.  Come on, Alice, I need protection!

              A LONG WIDE SHOT reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull
              of a hot afternoon.
 
              At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of
              the group:  MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.  They
              are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.  There is no
              real attempt to exert too much energy.
 
              Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's
              POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,
              on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.
 
              Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally,
              we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush.

              The group sits or lies in the cool water, more or less focused
              on NED, who is acting as moderator.
 
                                  NED
                      What do you want to be when you grow up?

                      Okay, Fireman.
 
              NED goes to JACK.

              The PROWLER looks in LONG SHOT down at the lake and we can just
              make out the COUNSELLORS.
 
              The CAMERA PANS and we move toward cabins.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

        47    EXT. LAKE - DAY
 
              ALICE is treading water, talking with BRENDA, as NED comes up
              out of nowhere.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize the
                      nitrites or something.
 
              NED surfaces between them.  He looks with googly eyes at ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      There are sand sharks in this lake and
                      they can eat the bathing suit right off
                      you.
 
              ALICE laughs.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      See?  I'm getting to you.  Very slowly.
 
              NED does a porpoise drive and disappears.
 
              BRENDA is not laughing.  She is looking off towards the cabin
              area.
 
              ALICE sees her and look where she looks.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What'd you see?
 
                                  BRENDA
                      I don't know.  Marcie's got me paranoid.
 
              She smiles.

        48    EXT. BEHIND ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place
              alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet
              tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down
              and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.
 
              The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a
              burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the
              bag, which has something in it that moves.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below
              the window.  The window is open, making entry quite simple.

              The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in
              and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.  One hand has the
              animal firmly behind the jaws.  The hand takes the snake and
              puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white
              coverlet.  It slithers across the bed.
 
              The PROWLER's hand closes the window.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.

              BILL and ALICE are lying on the shore on their towels, watching
              the OTHERS in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun.  ALICE
              is on her stomach, tracing angular designs in the sand.  BILL
              is on his back, listening.
 
                                  BILL
                      It still hurts?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt,
                      but I thought I could stand anything.
                            (pause)
                      I just wasn't ready for that kind of
                      pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A.
                      When I got back there, he sent a telegram
                      saying he was going back to his wife.
 
              BILL turns over so he can look at her better.
 
                                  BILL
                      What'll you do when you leave here?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.
 
              Various feet enter the FRAME.  BILL and ALICE look up to see
              JACK with his arm around MARCIE, NED toweling his head, and
              BRENDA putting on her blue workshirt.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe
                      and I are going back to work.
 
              BILL gets up.
 
                                  BILL
                      Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm
                      ready.  Frozen yogurt?

              ALICE smiles at the reference.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll be along.
 
                                  NED
                            (in a nelly voice)
                      Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll
                      scratch your eyes out...
 
              They head off.  ALICE turns over to tan her front.

              A machete rips through some vines.  Again it hacks at the brush.
 
              PULLS BACK to reveal BILL clearing away the years of vine
              growth which have choked off a path.  He wipes the perspiration
              from his eyes and continues along.

              Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There
              are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's
              an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights
              made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.
 
              ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He
              explodes his breath.
 
              We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven
              parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt
              about his strength.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Not bad.
 
              As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat
              little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take.
 
                                  NED
                      Holy shit...

                      We wouldn't want you thinking you're the
                      only show-off in camp, would we?

              The CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the
              late sun.  A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with
              a start.
 
              CUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I didn't know I was asleep...What time

                      Now I'm only eleven hours behind

              ALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen
              this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it.
 
                                  BILL
                      You can only do what you can do.
 
                                  ALICE
                      And then Steve looks at you with those
                      hurt eyes--like you don't care about
                      children...
 
              BILL laughs at her imitation.

                            (continuing)
                      I'll see you later.
 
              She turns to go up the steps to her front door.

                      Alice?
 
              She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares.

              ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it
              wasn't easy for BILL to say.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're very nice.
 
              They share a short silent moment.

                      Hope you will.
 
              BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long
              blade.
 
              ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place
              to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin.

        54    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake
              is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
 
              ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
              been since we met her.
 
              The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
              dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light
              blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all
              the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
              in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
 
              ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
              she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
              sexier.  She smiles at herself.
 
              She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.
 
              ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens
              it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.
 
              She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.

        56    INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY
 
              ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a
              towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for
              her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled
              hair fall down.
 
              She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails
              at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
              as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the
              bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake
              falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
 
              There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.
              Her scream is loud.

              BILL, returning from his last half hour of trail-blazing, hears
              ALICE.
 
                                  ALICE (O.S.)
                      Help!
 
              BILL doesn't hesitate.  Carrying his machete, he runs to
              ALICE's cabin.
 
              MARCIE and JACK follow in the BG.

        58    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              ALICE is backed against the wall.  The snake could strike and
              get her.
 
              BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks
              at ALICE.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a tight whisper)
                      There's a fucking snake in here.

              BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.
              Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the
              machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto
              the floor.
 
              MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.
              MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further
              to see the blood and guts.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack,
                      would you get some paper towels?
 
              JACK nods and exits.
 
                                  ALICE
                      How the... did he get in there?
 
                                  BILL
                      Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of
                      your perfume.
 
              JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      You okay now?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
              BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly,
              stepping on MARCIE's big toe.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time.
                            (to JACK)
                      Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
 
              JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets
              underneath the wide-fanged snake.
 
              MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper
              toweling.

              Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among

              The kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the
              same room, cut off by a partition.  The kitchen has a couple of
              sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and
              some windows which look out on the rear.
 
              BRENDA is making a salad for herself.  She is a vegetarian.
              MARCIE is making a guacamole dip.
 
              In the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table.
              JACK and BILL are playing.

              ALICE walks into the kitchen.  She has washed her face after
              getting her act together.  She stands in the doorway to the
              kitchen.

              The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder.
 
              The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but
              there is something standing there out by a cabin.  But it
              stands, doesn't move... Is it a building?
 
              CUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass.

              standing.  The puddle is somehow significant.

                                  BILL
                      This is almost like the one at my

                      Here we go.
 
              The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we
              see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he
              concentrates.  He bites down on it.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine
              roars into action.

              CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal
              switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a
              perfect connection running through his body.  There is a
              sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
              screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are
              streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
              shoes.
 
              BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and
              continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
              at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-
              kick on his friend, severing the contact.

              JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The
              machine stops.

              JACK shakes his head.
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll be okay.  Holy shit...
 
                                  BILL
                      Don't get up.  Take a second...
 
              JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm.
 
                                  JACK
                      You saved my life.
 
                                  BILL
                      I had to.
 
                                  JACK
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd
                      have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that
                      would have ruined my appetite.
 
              JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy
              athlete gets to his feet.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whew.
 
              Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and
              looks in.
 
              We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred
              switch and a now-silent generator.
 
                                  BILL
                      This puddle was enough to ground you all
                      the way to China.
 
              JACK looks in, too.

                                  JACK
                      Floor probably leaks.  This area is full
                      of springs.
 
                                  BILL
                      A short somewhere.
 
              BILL leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches
              another wire.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked
                      itself loose.
 
              He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU.
 
                                  JACK
                      Just in cause this bugger goes bad.  I'm
                      gonna pick up some lanterns from the
                      equipment shack.
 
              JACKS walks away.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        63    INT. EQUIPMENT SHED - DUSK
 
              The door opens at us, letting in the limited light.  JACK comes
              in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp.  He flicks it on.
              As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the CAMERA
              slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets
              and knives.  They are all missing.
 
              JACK takes his booty and exits.
 
              The light is gone and we are alone in the dark.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              ECU of the lightbulb over the kitchen area.  It flickers on as
              we hear in the BG the sound of the generator start up.  The
              bulb glows, goes down, glows cheerily.

                                  BRENDA
                      That was the telephone.

                                  NED
                      Ha!  You wily oriental!  The phone was
                      "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you."
                      "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
 
              JACK comes in with his lanterns followed by BILL.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Last line of Gone With the Wind?
 
                                  NED
                      Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
 
              ALICE listens as she washes the dishes.  It looks as if things
              will be okay.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Shows how much you know.  It's something
                      about tomorrow.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Tomorrow is another day.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Right!  Right!
 
              MARCIE is finishing up making her green California dip.
 
              Suddenly ALICE cries out.  Everybody whips around to see.
              ALICE holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a
              bottle.  She has cut her finger.  It is not a serious cut, but
              the blood is visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      This just plain ain't my day.
 
              BILL reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a BandAid.
 
                           MARCIE                        NED
                   You okay?                     Those things can be nasty.
 
                           BRENDA
                   Wash it out real good.
 
              BILL comes up to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Lemme see.  Doesn't look too bad.
 
              That said, the OTHERS go back to what they were doing.
 
              BILL and ALICE are featured even though we can hear the others.
              BILL takes great care and puts the BandAid on ALICE's finger.

              They share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest
              continues.

                           ALICE                 Aaaargh!  That my
                   I was careless.               guaranteed winner!
 
                           BILL                          MARCIE
                   How'd it get in there?        Melvin Belli?
 
                           ALICE
                   Somebody probably dropped
                   something too hard.
 
                                  NED
                      Alice, you're just lucky there are no
                      snakes in the dishwater here.
 
              NEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE
              has just made.  He dips a chip as soon as she steps back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.
 
              Suddenly NED's face goes red.  His eyes bulge out.  He grabs
              his throat and gags.  Coughs, can't clear it.
 
                                  JACK
                      What is it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Is it stuck?
 
              NED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he
              writhes about.
 
                           MARCIE                        ALICE
                   Help him!                     Oh, my God!
 
                           BILL                          JACK
                   Roll him over!                Get behind him more.
 
              As BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich,
              NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.  It's a big finish:
 
                                  NED
                      Ta-da!

              REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on.
 
                                  JACK
                      Not funny, Ned...
 
              BILL stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Wait'll you're really in trouble and see
                      what happens...
 
                                  NED
                      But it's in the brochure!  "Camp Crystal
                      Lake has a full drama program."  You
                      just saw it.
 
              NED tries to laugh it off.  They shake their heads.  MARCIE
              walks away.  JACK looks at BILL.
 
                                  BILL
                      Chance to get even?
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll spot you five points.
 
                                  NED
                      Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it
                      again.
 
              NED turns and heads for the door.  ALICE comes up next to him.
              The OTHERS are out of earshot now.  BILL and JACK play a little
              ping-pong.  NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting
              stunt.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Ned?  We're gonna be working together
                      for a while.  You're a nice guy without
                      all the entertainment, okay?
 
              NED relaxes.  Nods.  He knows what she means.  He turns to look
              at the others.
 
                                  NED
                      Tell 'em I'm sorry?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.

                                  NED
                      I'm gonna go lie down and catch some
                      z's.  Today wiped me out.
                            (pause)
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're welcome.
 
              The CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.  In the BG,
              MARCIE speaks.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I hope that's the last time we see the
                      Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.

              toward his cabin.
 
              The CAMERA stays with the troubled child as he stops, leans
              down, picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush.  It
              cuts through.  He flips a few stones in his hand.
 
              NED looks off.  Sees something.
 
              WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:  a shape--a human shape--standing by a
              cabin.
 
              NED walks towards it.
 
                                  NED
                      Hello?  Can I help you?

              ALICE is just drying her hands.  She stands next to a giant
              stack of clean dishes and pots.
 
              BRENDA is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower
              and cucumber slices.
 
              BILL and JACK saunter in.
 
                                  JACK
                      You just had some lucky shots.

                                  BILL
                      Where's Ned?
 
                                  ALICE
                      He went to bed early.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I don't blame him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      He's probably setting up another one of
                      his practical jokes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Yeah, like draining the lake!
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  JACK
                            (to MARCIE)
                      Hey, how about a walk by the lake?
 
              The OTHERS all go "Ooooooooh."

                            (continuing)
                      Just a walk, for Chrissakes.

                            (kidding)
                      Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy
                      small-minded people around here.
                            (to JACK)
                      Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and
                      be right with you.
 
              MARCIE puts an arm through JACK's arm and they exit.
 
              The OTHERS laugh.

        67    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - NIGHT
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk across the pint needles towards the lake.
              There is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on
              the horizon.
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk along the shore to the lake.  They have
              turned on the flashlights which they carry with them.

                                  JACK
                      Wind's up.  It's shifted a good hundred
                      and eighty degrees.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
 
                                  JACK
                      I love you.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I love you.
 
              They kiss.  MARCIE pulls back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      What about Neddy?
 
                                  JACK
                      I don't love Neddy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Ned!
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Don't call him.
 
                                  JACK
                      I thought you wanted to give him one of
                      your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do
                      whatever he wants to do, you know.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I guess...
 
              The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light.
 
                                  JACK
                      Looks like a storm.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I'm a little scared of storms.  Always
                      have been.  Since I was a kid.
 
                                  JACK
                      You?  The brick?
 
              JACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie
              shadows.  She flashes hers at him.

                                  MARCIE
                      I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a
                      dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm.
                      The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can
                      hear the sound.  I try to close my ears
                      off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets
                      louder.  The rain turns to blood and the
                      blood washes down in little rivers.  And
                      the sound stops.
 
              A loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.  MARCIE is
              startled and reaches out for her lover.
 
                                  JACK
                      It's just a dream.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I call it my shower dream.
 
              They look at one another in the two lights.  They grin.  Rain
              drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them.
 
                                  JACK
                      This is no dream.  Want to escape for a
                      while?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Lead the way!
 
              JACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.  MARCIE is only
              a half step behind, laughing.
 
              FROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.  There is no theme,
              just the rumble of thunder...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        68    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and
              JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the
              nearest bed.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Are you wet?
 
                                  JACK
                      Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman.
 
              He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points
              straight up and gives them some light to see by.

              They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's
              hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up
              towards his head.  He leans back and takes it off, and tosses
              it at the CAMERA.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        69    EXT. FRONT OF MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The rain has gathered in intensity.  ALICE comes up to the
              front door and looks out.  BILL comes up behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
 
                                  BILL
                      Not if they're where I think they are.
 
              ALICE laughs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not always this stupid.
 
              She turned back into the cabin.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        70    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              TIGHT on JACK and MARCIE as they make love under a camp
              blanket.  Their breathing and noises are heard just above the
              sounds of the rain outside.
 
              The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have
              leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and
              dribbled down.  As the bed shakes with its love-making, the
              CAMERA PANS up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course.
 
              As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see
              NED lying in the upper bunk.  In a flash of lightning we
              realize he is dead:  his throat has been slashed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  JACK and MARCIE lie completely still beneath
              their blanket.  The CAMERA PANS along their quiet bodies.
              MARCIE's face is contented.  JACK is ready to doze off.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Mmmmmmmph?
 
                                  JACK
                      Mmmmmmmph.

                                  MARCIE
                      Best over...
 
                                  JACK
                      Umhummmmph.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Like waves.  It's never been likes waves
                      before.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whassamatta?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Gotta pee.  You're lying on my bladder.
 
              She rolls over and grabs her underpants and t-shirt.  While
              still on the bottom bunk, she puts herself into her limited
              clothing.  JACK gives her room.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (dressing)
                      I know this ain't very romantic, but
                      what can I say?  I don't want to explode.
 
              She grabs a flashlight, scoots to the door and is gone.
 
              JACK lies back and puts his hands under his hand.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        71    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT
 
              MARCIE runs across the now-wet central area towards the
              bathroom facility.  She tries to skip between the raindrops,
              but she knows she'll get a drenching.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        72    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              JACK rolls to his side, picks up a small hand-rolled cigarette
              and lights it.  He inhales deeply, rolls on his back.
              Something overhead catches his eye.
 
              Across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower
              stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors.
              We hear the toilet flush.
 
              We CUT INSIDE the toilet booth as MARCIE stands reading the
              graffiti to herself.  We can only see her from the chest up.

                                  MARCIE
                            (reading)
                      "Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie
                      Makit."  "The Yellow Stream by I.P.
                      Daley."  Not the most original stuff,
                      kids.
 
              There is a noise outside the stall.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?
 
              She hears no response and assumes that her imagination is
              playing tricks with her.  MARCIE picks up the flashlight and
              exits the stall.
 
        73    MARCIE crosses to the row of sinks, stops, puts the
              flashlight down and turns on the water faucet.  There is
              no water.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              PROWLER'S POV:  of MARCIE.
 
              From the end of the row of showers, we watch MARCIE bend under
              the sink and turn on one of the spigots.  Water rushes into the
              sink.
 
        74    MCU MARCIE:  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and
              turns off the water.  Again she hears a noise.  She looks
              to the row of showers and smiles.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Jack?
 
              The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut.
 
              MARCIE looks over, smiles.  She thinks someone is trying to
              scare her.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on.
 
              There is a dripping sound.  MARCIE stops at the first shower,
              hesitates.
 
              Throws back the first curtain.  There is no one there.  She
              reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off.
 
              She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the
              empty toilet.  Then reaches in to the shower curtain.

                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Allee allee infree!
 
              She throws back the curtain.  Again no one is there.
 
              She breathes a sigh of disappointment.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Must be my imagination.
 
              In CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the
              TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.  It happens in a flash.
              A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first
              shower.  A hatchet glints.  MARCIE screams.  The hatchet
              strikes.  The flashlight clatters to the floor.

        75    EXT. DINER - NIGHT
 
              The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an
              establishing shot of the diner.  Through the window, which are
              being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS
              seated on stools at the counter.

              The WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly
              older, but still attractive.  She says good night to her
              CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the
              counter.  Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of
              coffee.  The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and
              tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Anything else you want?
 
                                  STEVE
                      No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy.
 
                                  SANDY
                      You can't go back there tonight.  Not in
                      that stuff.  'Less you wanta get drownded.

                            (drinking quickly)
                      I got to.

                                  SANDY
                      Aw.
 
              SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I have six new counsellor up there.
                      They're all babes in the woods in every
                      sense of the word.
 
                                  SANDY
                      They'll be okay if they know enough to
                      stay in outta the rain.
 
 
                      How much do I owe you?
 
                                  SANDY
                      One night on the town.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I mean...
 
                                  SANDY
                      ...I know what you mean.  Two and a
                      quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to
                      make up for me spending the night alone.
 
              STEVE pays up and walks to the cash register.
 
                                  SANDY
                            (continuing)
                      You got a roof for that Jeep?
 
              She rings up the money.  Gives him his change.  He hands her a
              tip.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Yeah.  I got it on before this--
                            (indicates the storm outside)
                      --all started.
 
                                  SANDY
                      That's thirty percent.
 
                                  STEVE
                      For two lonely nights.
 
              She smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that
              extra makeup.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb
                      self.

              STEVE smiles and leaves.  She watches, then counts her changes
              and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day.

              The rain continues as STEVE exits the diner, gets in his Jeep
              and starts it up.  He roars off through a big puddle, splashing
              water towards the CAMERA.  The Jeep pulls a small equipment
              trailer.

              PROWLER'S POV:  From outside the cabin, we can see some
              activity in the big meeting room.  The CAMERA moves slightly
              from left to right as the shot is established.  Then an unseen
              hand releases a branch which partially blocks the shot.

              ALICE enters from the kitchen, carrying two cups of coffee.
              She hands one to BRENDA, who is curled up on the couch in front
              of the fire.  BILL stands to the left of the hearth, picks up
              a couple of pieces of dry woods and puts them on to burn.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You think they fell asleep?
 
                                  BILL
                      Anything's possible.  My parents taught
                      me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      It wouldn't matter except Steve should be
                      getting back pretty soon.  It wouldn't
                      look so great if he fell over them.

                                  BILL
                      Good point.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Well, it hasn't been that long.
 
              BRENDA smiles.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Long enough for me.
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I think we should go wake them up.  Just
                      in case.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Give them a little while longer.  It's
                      still early, anyway.

              Lighted by dash panel, STEVE tries to concentrate on seeing the
              road.  He leans forward, rubs a cloth on the windshield to get
              rid of the condensation.
 
              From his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay
              ahead of the rain.  Beyond them the headlights make a slight
              dent in the night.
 
              In the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is
              bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical
              storm.
 
              STEVE's hand reaches in and shuts off the radio.

              ALICE has finished her coffee.  BILL enters, shakes the rain
              off his poncho and stamps his feet.
 
                                  BILL
                      Got to it just in time.  The generator
                      was running on fumes.  I filled it up.
                      That should keep it humming until Steve
                      gets back.
 
              BRENDA gets up.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Good night, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Good night, Brenda.
 
              BRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her
              head like a portable tent, she races off into the night.
 
              ALICE watches her go.  A glimmer of lightning outlines her as
              she heads off.
 
              BILL walks back into the big room, followed by ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Help you clean up?

                      Absolutely.
 
 
 
              She walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups
              into the kitchen.

              slicker.  Her actions are direct and business-like.
 
              BRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in
              the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an
              examination lamp.  She takes out a toothbrush and some other
              toilet articles.
 
              She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.  She put her
              lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.  She
              stands up, and washes her hands and face.

              She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound
              that Marcie had heard.  BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls,
              shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.

              mirror.
 
              STEVE, wearing a yellow slicker, gets out of the Jeep to try to
              flag down the oncoming car.

              car, driven by a middle-aged cop named TIERNEY.  TIERNEY has
              the window down already.
 
                                  TIERNEY

                      I think water got into the electrical
                      system.  You ride me back to camp?  I'll
                      get one of my counsellors to drive me
                      back tomorrow morning.

                      That could drive a person bug-city.
 
              The SOUND is apparently coming from the front of the cabin;
              perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet.
 
              BRENDA grabs her slicker and heads out.
 
              The CAMERA FOLLOWS BRENDA through the darkened cabin to the
              front door.

              ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER:  as BRENDA hears the tapping sound
              closer by.  She looks and sees.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a
              string and left it dangling from the eaves.  The wind blows,
              making the knife tap against the building.

                      Neddy?  Cut the screwing around, Neddy!
 
              She grabs the knife, breaking the string.

                      Bad enough we got a full moon; it's
                      Friday the 13th.  They keep statistics.
                      We get more accidents, more robberies,
                      more rapes, more homicides, more of
                      everything when there's a full moon.  It
                      affects people.  Makes 'em nuts.

                                  STEVE
                      You've made a science out of coincidence.
 
              The police radio, which has been on "squelch," comes on.

              within.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Brenda?  Brenda?  You there?
 
              There is no response.  The CAMERA stays in a MCU of ALICE as
              she and BILL cross up the stairs and into the cabin.

              The cabin is empty.  Jack's backpack lies on the bed, the
              contents neatly laid out.

              BILL walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers.

                            (continuing)
                      I think we should call the police, Bill.
 
              BILL, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods
              and turns back to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Okay.
 
              They exit.  There is a beat... and then a slickered shape
              passes between us and the night sky light which comes through
              the windows.  The shape is dragging something.

       106    EXT. OFFICE CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.  To the
              left of the door is a small sign that reads:  "Office."  BILL
              tries the door, but cannot open it.
 
                                  BILL
                      Sucker's locked.  Who's got the key?
 
              ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and
              comes up with a short 2x4.  She crosses to the door and smashes
              through one of the window panes.  She puts her arm through the
              broken glass, unlocks the door and enters.  BILL follows.
 
              The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.
              They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's
              desk.  BILL picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch
              on the desk set several times.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      It's dead.  Try the pay phone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Do you have a dime?  A quarter?
 
                                  BILL
                      No.  There must be some in the desk
                      somewhere.
 
              They fumble through the desk to find some change.  BILL finds
              some in the postage drawer.  He then crosses over to a pay
              phone mounted on the wall.  The CAMERA moves to the cornice of
              the building where the phone line exits.  It follows the link
              up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and
              phone lines come in from the pole.  Here we see a dangling
              phone cable which has been recently cut.

              OVER, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead
              telephone.
 
                                  ALICE (V.O.)

                      too.

              ALICE hops in on the passenger side.
 
              BILL turns over the engine.  It grinds away but does not catch.
 
              From an ANGLE behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine
              fail to catch.  We look in the mirror and see someone standing
              in the distance, watching.
 
              BILL gets out of the driver's side.  Slams the door.  The
              CAMERA TRUCKS with him as he opens the door to the engine.
              ALICE joins him as he shines his light on the engine.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What's the matter with it?

                      Wet.  I don't know.
 
              He tries a few more times.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Why don't we run?  Just run now?

                      It's over twenty miles to the
                      crossroads.  Steve'll be back in an
                      hour.  Things will straighten out then.
                      We'll take his Jeep and get help.
 
              He goes to her and cradles her face in his hands.

                            (continuing)
                      Don't worry.  There is probably some
                      really stupid explanation for all this.
                      When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll
                      smile.
                            (pause)
                      Promise.
 
              ALICE nods.

              The figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as STEVE
              CHRISTY.  Just as he's about to make the turn into the
              driveway, he looks up and smiles.  He stops and catches his
              breath as the other person catches him in the light of a

              BILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.  In the BG,
              ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.  On the coffee table in front
              of her is a large machete.

              BILL's eyes are closing.  He jerks himself awake, then starts
              to doze again.
 
              The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out.
 
              BILL snaps awake.  He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks
              it on.

              table.
 
              BILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits,
              carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp.

              It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer.
 
              BILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.  He looks
              in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on.
 
              Then his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug.
              He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He
              puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed.

       115    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              ALICE sits up into the CAMERA, startled and afraid.

                                  ALICE
                      Bill?!
 
              She gets her bearings and looks around.  Stands up.  She looks
              at the bulb overhead.  Pulls its string.  No light.
 
              She sees the lanterns which have been placed around.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      The generator...
 
              Now that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a
              little.  Smiles.  She goes to the mantelpiece, takes the lantern,
              and walks into the kitchen.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       116    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea
              kettle with water.  She puts it on the stove and pops on a
              burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee.
 
              Impatient and curious, she walks to the front door of the cabin
              and looks out.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?  Bill?
 
              The calm which she had grasped a few moments before is beginning
              to desert her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
       117    INSERT:  Whistling tea kettle on the kitchen stove.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       118    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE takes the kettle off the flame.
 
              The whistling stops abruptly.  ALICE pours water into the two
              cups.  She stirs the coffee.
 
              Unable to contain her impatience any longer, ALICE picks up her
              lantern, grabs a slicker, and heads out the door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       119    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE walks very quickly around the side of the cabin, headed
              for the generator shed.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       120    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT
 
              The door to the shed is closed.  ALICE looks around and then
              puts a hand on the hand.  In CU we see the hand pull.  The door
              doesn't budge.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE decides to pull harder.
 
              She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.  She pulls
              until she finally wrenches the door open.  The lamp casts long
              shadows upwards.
 
              The generator sits silent.
 
              ALICE leans into the shed to look.
 
              The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can
              see behind the right-hand corner of the building.  As we clear
              the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down
              from a branch above.
 
              The something turns slowly in the wind.  It is BILL--dead--in
              a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.
 
              ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?
 
              She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  She is riveted with horror, unable to
              move or turn or run.  The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME,
              the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.
 
              ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again.  She
              turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main
              cabin.

                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      Help!  Help!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       121    INT. MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE bursts through the front door into CAMERA.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack!  Marcie!  Help me!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       122    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete.
              It is not there.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The knife!
 
              She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it.
 
              LOW ANGLE:  as she scrabbles on all fours.  Nothing under the
              couch.
 
              ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the
              lamp.
 
              Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a
              window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass,
              shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.
 
              It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.
 
              ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front
              door.
 
              ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited
              figure.
 
              ALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.
 
              When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early
              forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.
              This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long
              enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently,
              pointing back to the rear window.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't
                      help you if you can't talk to me.
                      There, there now...
 
              ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.  In the BG we can see
              the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      He's dead... She's dead... all dead...
                      Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh
                      my God, oh my God... oh God...
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It will be all right.  I'll take care of
                      you.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack?  Marcie?  Ned?
 
              MRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It's just this place.  The storm.
                      That's why you're all upset.
 
                                  ALICE
                      No, no, they're all dead...
 
              ALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table
              without looking.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'll go look.
 
              ALICE's face registers the new terror.
 
                                  ALICE
                      They'll kill you!  Don't leave me!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'm not afraid.
 
              ALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to
              the back window.
 
                                  ALICE
                      All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie...

              ALICE stands close to the fireplace.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.  BRENDA's body
              sways just out of reach.  MRS. VOORHEES is shocked.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      Oh, my lord...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table,
              she picks up the lantern.
 
              ALICE waits at the fireplace.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      So young, so pretty.  What monster could
                      have done such a thing?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill--Bill--Bill is out there...
 
              She lets MRS. VOORHEES take her in her arms.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      We shall go straight to the police.
 
              ALICE backs up.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The killer is still out there.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I will protect you.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks around the room.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Oh, this place... It should never have
                      been a camp.  Not for children.  They
                      had so much trouble here.
 
              The fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace.  A log burns
              through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Camp Blood.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has almost completely calmed the girl down.
              Strokes her soft hair.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      You know a boy drowned the year before
                      those two others were killed?  An
                      accident?  It was inadequate supervision.
                      The counsellors were not paying enough
                      attention... They were making love when
                      that boy drowned.
 
              ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the
              YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.  The hand is missing its little finger!
 
              The THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like
              version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      We should go now.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No.  That won't be necessary.
 
              As she speaks, MRS. VOORHEES reaches into her slicker in a
              surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting
              knife.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't understand.
 
              MIXED on the TRACK, filtered, echoed and distant, is the SOUND
              of a ten year old boy, JASON, crying for help in a fantasy
              version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                            (filtered)
                      Help me, mommy... save me... please,
                      mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy...
                      save me....
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (cocking her hand to listen)
                      I am, Jason.  I am.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a little confused)
                      Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?

              MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.  While her
              voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip
              into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with
              the visibility of her weapon.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It was my son they killed.  They said he
                      drowned, but I know it was inadequate
                      supervision...
 
              ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.  She can't see the
              knife rise behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Mr. Christy will be back soon.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No, he won't.  I killed him as well....
 
              The shock of recognition hits ALICE.  In CU her eyes look up
              and see the knife which MRS. VOORHEES now has poised and ready
              to strike.
 
              ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the
              fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES stands and steps forward.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      I couldn't let them start this camp
                      again, could I?
 
              ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.  She grabs the fireplace
              poker.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I won't let you!
 
              ALICE swings the poker back and forth.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      No!  No!  No!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife.
              ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib
              cage.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage.
 
              ALICE drops the poker to run for the door.

              MRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE
              deliberately.
 
              Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       123    EXT. MAIN CABIN/TREE - NIGHT
 
              ALICE gets to the door and stops.  She fiddles with the side of
              the screen... somebody has latched it.
 
              CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at
              the door, snapping the latch.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the
              thunder and the lightning.  The THEME is going full-tilt as
              ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
 
              TWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from
              above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of
              STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under
              his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade
              protrudes from his heart.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair
              of legs which swing from the same big tree.
 
              STROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.  In the BG we
              see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance
              between herself and ALICE.

              ALICE runs for the door, slams through it.
 
              The CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       125    EXT. GENERATOR SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       126    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.  We hear the
              SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three
              bright overhead lights come on.
 
              ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to
              reveal her hiding place.
 
              She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it,
              then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few
              feet.
 
              She carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in
              CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Help, mommy, I'm drowning!  Oh, mommy,
                      please....
 
              The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of
              JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC.  She is both
              characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.
 
              ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the
              VOICE OF JASON.
 
              ALICE is very still.  Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS.
              VOORHEES rave.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Don't let me die, mommy... I can't
                      breathe... Help me, breathe...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is having trouble catching her own breath.  She
              strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the
              child stops.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (in her own voice)
                      I can't let them kill any more children.
                      Come out now.
 
              She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her
              way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the
              PROWLER.
 
              When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across
              her path like a barred door.  Before ALICE can think twice,
              MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that
              now ALICE is sandwiched between them.

              She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--
              the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
 
              ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.  On the shelf is a box.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.
              Her machete is coming up in an attack.
 
              ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of
              leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard
              as she can.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning
              knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low
              animal bellow.
 
              ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.
 
              ALICE gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out.
 
              We can hear JASON'S VOICE.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her!

       127    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS/EQUIP. SHED - NIGHT
 
              The central area is bathed in light.  The rain has stopped.
              MRS. VOORHEES has turned on all the flood-lights.
 
              ALICE runs to the corner of one of the cabins.  She stops to
              look back.  MRS. VOORHEES is gaining on her.
 
              ALICE runs to the equipment shed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  The door is thrown back.  ALICE goes in.  Looks
              for a weapon.  Nothing is available.  ALICE sobs with fear.
              She runs.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES passes the equipment shed.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       128    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              A single bulb outside the building shows ALICE as she bursts
              through the door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       129    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              It is a small cabin.  On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.
 
              ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles
              from the wall.
 
              She rummages in a drawer.  It's empty.  She tries another.
              Empty.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Where are the goddamned bullets?
 
              The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it.
 
              ALICE looks around.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       130    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night.

       131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the
              rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt
              stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She
              turns.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,
              blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES
              steps slowly toward ALICE.
 
              ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only
              thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,
              swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the
              arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and
              drops to the floor.

              ALICE runs out the door.

              ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the
              front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is
              no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs
              into the kitchen.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide.
              She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and
              then hides there, closing the door behind her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT
 
              There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.
              ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type
              which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
 
              ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
 
              As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.
              Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are
              turned on.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Please kill her, mommy... Help me,
                      please.  Kill her, mommy.
 
              There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the
              sound of another door being slammed.
 
              ALICE relaxes again.
 
              Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door
              now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the
              idea.
 
              She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are
              the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large
              skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
 
              ALICE covers her head with her arms.

              The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
              slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand
              finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is
              almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
 
              The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
 
                                  JASON (O.S.)
                      Come out, come out, wherever you are...
 
              ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
              room.
 
              Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Please...
 
              ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
 
              The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
 
              The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has
              begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
              door to the larder.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...
 
              At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see
              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's
              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
              anything...
 
              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.
              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near
              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
 
              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and
              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
              come through the entrance.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the
              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
              floor.

              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses
              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a
              small puddle of blood under her head.
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
              slowly out of the room.

       135    EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              The moon comes out from behind a cloud.  ALICE pushes a canoe
              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will
              permit, out in the lake to safety.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              Exhausted, ALICE puts her paddle across her lap and falls
              forward, slumped across a thwart.

              The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the
              horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.  The birds are
              up, foraging for food.
 
              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky
              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe
              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the
              surface of the lake.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN
 
              ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not
              changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The
              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,
              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.
 
              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.

              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe
              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
              lapping water.
 
              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
 
              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES
              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get
              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle
              floating near her.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.
              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her
              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!
 
              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts
              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out
              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the
              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and
              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.
 
              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                            (continuing)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!
 
              ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
              one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
              off into the water.
 
              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
 
              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
              shore.

              ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.  We hear
              the sound of a car approaching.  Now it comes into view.  It is
              a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door
              that says "State Department of Health and Safety".  There are
              two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.
 
              ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.

                      Good morning, miss.

                      Are you all right, ma'am?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Help me.
 
              The CAMERA PANS BACK while the two men get out of their vehicle
              and come around to help ALICE.

              LONG SHOT of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of

              CHILDREN playing.

              In the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying
              a game of softball.
 
              In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.  CLAUDETTE is 17
              years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant
              Counsellor" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well.
 
              Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks
              quickly in the opposite direction.
 
              The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we
              SUPERIMPOSE:

              The COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the
              line.
 
              CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Have you seen Barry?
 
              The COUNSELLOR smiles.  Shrugs.

                      He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time
                      I saw him.
 
              CLAUDETTE leaves.  The COUNSELLOR smiles.

              Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE
              passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.
 
              BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
              behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
              and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
              cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
              an Everly Brothers hit.
 
              BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not
              ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      We've got to talk.
 
              BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Okay.
 
         5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his
              shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.
 
              The Everly Brothers continue as we:

              From over the tops of a rack of canoes we see BARRY and
              CLAUDETTE walking along the shore.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      You said we were special.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I meant everything.
 
              In the BG, CHILDREN leap into the water.

                                  BARRY
                            (continuing)
                      You know what I said, though.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      I can't, Barry...

         7    EXT. FOREST - DAY
 
              The TRACK goes SILENT.
 
              BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path.  This is not an aimless
              walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.  He leaves
              the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
              CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I care very much.
 
              He puts an arm around her and draws her close.  They kiss.
              They separate.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
 
              BARRY decides to be politic.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I wouldn't know.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Oh, you...
 
              She kisses him and they are locked.
 
              A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
 
              The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE:  Just beyond the thicket of
              lacy vines.  It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
 
              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
 
              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
              breast.  She reaches up to take his hand away.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Claudette...

                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Somebody'll see.
 
                                  BARRY
                      No, they won't...
 
              He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
              that part of her bra is exposed.  He seals her protesting lips
              by kissing her.
 
              From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
              A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
              the field of vision.  A branch pops.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                            (in a thick whisper)
                      Somebody's there, Barry.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Come on, Claudette.  A man's not made of
                      stone.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Let's go back, Barry...
 
                                  BARRY
                      I need you so much, Claudette.
 
              BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.  They kiss again,
              passionately.
 
              The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
              foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
              the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
 
              Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It
              swells.  Closer.
 
              QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
              perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
 
              Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
 
              A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
              blow.
 
              The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him
              by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
 
              A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.

              BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to
              the mossy floor of the clearing.
 
              Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it.
 
              There is a confused jumble of struggle.
 
              Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight.
 
              The PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward.
              We can hear the blade strike.
 
              BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
 
              MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into
              FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
 
              QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.
              She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her
              temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC
              has stopped abruptly.
 
              THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.
 
              It is completely SILENT.

              The screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to
              ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional
              rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final
              position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane
              of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper
              left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
 
              The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the
              Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.
 
              TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out.

                      Not likely.  Sam?  You goin' out to the
                      crossroads?
 
              The OIL MAN nods.
 
                                  TRUDY
                            (continuing)
                      Give her a lift?  That's hallway.

                            (paying up)
                      No sweat, Trudy.  Let's do it to it, kid.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      Name's Annie.

                                  OIL MAN
                      Okay, Annie.  Let's go.
 
              ANNIE steps aside as the OIL MAN heads for the front door.  He
              is smirking.  He's fifty, strong, and balding.  He makes no
              attempts to hide his appreciation for ANNIE's figure.
 
              They exits.
 
                                  TRUDY
                      I wouldn't send my kids to that camp for
                      all the tea in China.

                      I thought you hated your kids.
 
              TRUDY looks around, does a take, then laughs.

              ANNIE walks a half step behind the OIL MAN, heading for his
              truck which is parked there on the street.
 
                                  OIL MAN
                      All the girls up there gonna look as
                      good as you?
 
                                  ANNIE
                      I don't know.
 
              ANNIE wonders if she should accept the ride with this guy.
              Suddenly, from between two parked cars pops RALPH, a crazy hobo
              who has two dead rats in his mouth, their tails in his teeth;
              they swing from him like a strange beard.
 
                                  OIL MAN
                      Goddamnit, Ralph!  Get outta here.
                            (to ANNIE)
                      Don't worry about him.  He's harmless.
                            (back to Ralph)
                      G'won.  Git!
 
                                  RALPH
                      It's Friday the 13th.
 
              He giggles and skulks away.
 
                                  OIL MAN
                      Climb on up, Miss.

              The OIL MAN gives her a boost up and then climbs aboard the rig.

              He pats his rats.
 
              The OIL MAN shifts, looks over and smiles.  His two front teeth
              are missing on top.

              He turns on the radio in the cab and we hear the DJ again.

              The oil truck has stopped.  ANNIE stands alongside the driver's

                                  OIL MAN
                      Don't let the spooks getcha, Annie.

              ANNIE smiles.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      No sweat.  Thanks a lot for the lift.
 
              He nods and shakes his head with the sense of what might have
              been if he were thirty years younger.  He puts it in gear and
              roars off.
 
              ANNIE looks around and sees an old gas station.  It is closed.
              There's a sign which reads:  "No Gas 'Til Sat."  A mangey dog
              sits on the stoop watching ANNIE.
 
              ANNIE kneels down and calls the dog.  The dog comes.  ANNIE
              pets him and then heads off up the road.
 
              The dog watches her go.

              She looks up.
 
              From her POV a Jeep barrels along the road towards us.
 
              ANNIE puts out her numb.

              From the DRIVER'S POV, we see ANNIE waiting for a lift.  The
              DRIVER, unseen, shifts down until ANNIE is alongside.  The
              Jeep, an uncovered model, stops.  ANNIE smiles a big delicious
              smile at us as we sit in the DRIVER's seat.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      Hiya!  I'm headed for Camp Crystal Lake.
                      Can you help me out?
 
              Apparently the DRIVER nods, because ANNIE beams at us.  She
              tosses her pack in the back and hops aboard.  The DRIVER
              accelerates.

              Still in the DRIVER's POV, the CAMERA watches as ANNIE looks
              around, admires the woods, the Jeep, the day.  Things are going
              her way.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      I can't remember being this excited
                      about anything.  I want to be a teacher
                      when I finish at Southern State.  I
                      guess I've always wanted to work with
                      children.  I hate it when people call
                      'em kids.  Sounds like little goats.
 
              The forest outside the speeding Jeep is deeper and signs of
              civilization have all but disappeared.  ANNIE still turns and
              looks at the CAMERA when she speaks to the DRIVER.

                      The job market for teachers is supposed

              out and slaps ANNIE away.  We see that this hand is missing its
              little finger!
 
              Panicked, without any other recourse, ANNIE looks about her and
              then leaps from the moving Jeep, aiming for the relatively soft
              underbrush alongside the narrow road.

              windshield, keeping us from being able to see any details of
              the DRIVER.

              In a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to

              In the camper van are three young people.  They are full of
              fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake.
              They are instantly likeable.
 
              At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed
              upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice-
              looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction.
              He is funny and alert.
 
              Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as
              American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not
              as smart as NED.  He has to think things through.
 
              MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front
              passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.

              She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She
              enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by
              tragedy.

                      Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.

                      women.
 
              MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.

                      there'd by any other gorgeous women at
                      Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself.

                      arrive.  Then I'll act responsibly.
                      Until then, hit me.

                      It's beautiful...
 
                                  NED
                      Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't
                      seen a coat of paint in six years.

              The CAMERA SEES what NED saw.  The buildings are run down at
              the heels.  It is the same camp we saw in the early scenes, but
              time has torn the place badly.
 
              The van passes the CAMERA and we see the three new ARRIVALS
              looking out the window.

              This is the main building.  It is the building where Barry and
              Claudette met.  Outside is a flagpole, a small parking area, a
              large overhanging tree.
 
              In the BG we can see part of the lake.

              In the FG there is a Jeep.

              An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of
              a huge tree stump.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs,
              a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.  This is
              STEVE CHRISTY.  He is strong, charming, and engaging.  He is
              animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to
              do things.
 
              In the BG the van comes to a stop.  No sooner has JACK hopped
              down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Wanta give me a hand here?
 
              JACK smiles and comes quickly.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Alice?
 
              NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had
              polio when he was a kid.  His upper body is strong, but his
              legs are slightly deformed.  He and MARCIE hustle over to the
              big stump.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
                      Alice?
 
              ALICE comes into the MS.  She is carrying a shovel and a bucket
              and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Cabin B is ready.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack,
                      Marcie and Ned.  Push.
 
              They exchange "hellos" as they bend to the work.

                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve
                      Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
                      You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into
                      'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out
                      the boathouse.  I want him to start with
                      the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?
 
                                  ALICE
                      You told her to sweep the courts.
 
              STEVE sets off.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.
 
              As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      I thought we had two weeks...
 
              ALICE shrugs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You can changed in three.

              The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull
              up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing
              a coat of paint on the last canoe.
 
              BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his
              long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone
              call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the
              trail.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Steve said for you to start on the boats.
 
                                  BILL
                      I finished the boats.
 
              ALICE nods slowly.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll tell him.
 
              She turns away.

                                  BILL
                      Alice?  The others show up?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Everybody except the girl who's supposed
                      to handle the kitchen.  Annie.
 
              BILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps.
 
              ALICE look at him, then turns again.
 
                                  BILL
                      You think you're gonna last all summer?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not sure I'll last all week.
                            (pauses)
                      I'll tell Steve.

              STEVE and NED are rehanging a door.  Next to them is BRENDA, a
              dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting
              the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking
              paint.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Shim it up just a scooch.
 
              NED levers the door higher at the top.

                      To answer your question, my parents once
                      owned this camp.  There were some tragic
                      accidents and they went bankrupt.  I
                      promised them I'd reopen if I could.
                      See if it closes right now.
 
              NED swings the door on its hinges.
 
                                  NED
                      Looks good.

                                  STEVE
                      Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?
 
              BRENDA turns and nods.

                      I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned.
 
              They exit with the tool box.  MARCIE stops and turns to BRENDA,
              who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead.

              STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a
              swimming float down to the water's edge.  STEVE supervises as
              he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.  They ad-lid as
              appropriate.  ("There goes my hernia." "Are you sure you're
              lifting?" "Not so fast." "I'm walking backward.")

                      float in.
 
              They get behind it and shove it into the water.  NED hops
              aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.

              sun.  There is a shape.
 
              The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in
              on an errand.
 
              As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there
              are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple
              of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,
              etc.  Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives
              in sheathes, also hanging neatly.
 
              Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the
              shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.  JACK turns with
              a start.  He looks into the CAMERA.

              REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.

                      What are those for?  An Indian raid?

                      Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see
                      any life rings?
 
              MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.  She pulls out two
              rings.

                      Here.  Meet me in my cabin after taps.
                      Okay, Camper?
 
              She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose.

              sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.
 
              INSERT:  ALICE'S SKETCH.  It is a moody pierce, a sense of
              foreboding dominates it.  Otherwise, it is the camp's central
              compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You draw very well.

                      Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more
                      time at it.
 
              ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.  She reacts good-
              naturedly and keeps on working.
 
              STEVE bends down next to ALICE.

                      Just a feeling.

                      I don't know.  Probably be best for
                      everybody.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You may not care a lot about this place,
                      Alice, but I mean to make it my whole
                      life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme
                      a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it
                      ready.  Next Friday, if you're not
                      happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.
                      I'll be grateful.
 
              He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.
 
              She looks up.  She nods.

                      trailer and all that other stuff, but
                      I'll be back around ten.  If you're

                      her start in on the kitchen.  Do your
                      best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary
                      inspection by the state safety people.
                      I'd like to look good.
 
              He wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others
              stand looking before NED breaks the silence.
 
                                  NED
                      He neglected to mention this place is
                      called "Camp Blood" downtown.
 
              They are all getting back to work.
 
                                  ALICE
                      How come?
 
                                  NED
                      Some campers drowned.  Then some
                      counsellors got killed.

                      No shit.  When?
 
                                  NED
                      Late fifties sometime.  They never
                      caught the guy who did it either.

                      Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is
                      going to tell us that there are poisonous
                      snakes in the outhouse and green lizards
                      in the lake.
 
              As they laugh, the CAMERA HOLDS on ALICE.

              BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She
              enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of
              this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated
              than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.
 
              BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter
              and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are
              already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.
              The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.
 
              The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets
              closer to setting up the target.
 
              In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the
              face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the
              weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow
              streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by
              eighteen inches.
 
              BRENDA whips around.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-
              to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked
              simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair.
 
              She grabs the arrow and storms at him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You're crazy!
 
              She snaps the arrow in half.
 
                                  NED
                      Did anyone ever tell you you're
                      beautiful when you're angry?
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (plussed)
                      I don't believe you...
 
                                  NED
                      Want to see my trick shot?  It's even
                      better.
 
              BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's
              little she can do.  She laughs.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (still laughing)
                      You ever fire one of those bows again,
                      and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.

                                  NED
                      God, but I love that sexy talk.
 
              BRENDA snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the
              bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.

              This is a fairly large single room.  The walls are bare and
              uninsulated.  There are a few easels, but for the most part,
              the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.
 
              The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey
              wood interior appear silver-colored.  ALICE, her hair in a
              bandana, has just finished sweeping up.
 
              The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area
              on one easel.  On a second easel she has done the preliminary
              sketch of the lake itself.  It is also a moody picture.
 
              ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a
              little, then goes on to her next task.  There is a row of newly-
              arrived cardboard boxes.  She opens the first in CU with a
              matte knife.  She take out the invoice and checks it against
              the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the
              campers will make lanyards.

              ALICE snaps around, sensing that she is being watched.  In CU
              her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.  Her
              face relaxes until BANG!  The sound of a door slamming echoes
              through the room.
 
              The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK from her face to see someone standing in
              the doorway.
 
              It is BILL.

                                  BILL
                      Sorry.  How you doing?
 
              ALICE smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory.
              BILL watches her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Did you want something?
 
              She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.  She doesn't
              realize that there is something on top of the box.
 
                                  BILL
                      Steve said you were thinking of leaving.
                      True?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Un-hunh.
 
              ALICE lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working
              tools clatters down, shattering the silence.  ALICE fends off
              the flying implements and BILL rushes to her side.

                      You okay?
 
              She nods.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      You're lucky.
 
              They stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor.
              BILL looks at her while they work.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)

                                  ALICE
                      It's long and personal.  It has nothing
                      to do with you or the other kids.
 
                                  BILL
                      Maybe I can help?
 
              ALICE looks at BILL and smiles.  This really is a very nice, if
              naive, young man.

                                  ALICE

              As ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside.

              JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.  The

              At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of

              POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,
              on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.

              The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place
              alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet
              tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down
              and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.
 
              The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a
              burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the
              bag, which has something in it that moves.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below
              the window.  The window is open, making entry quite simple.

              The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in
              and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.  One hand has the
              animal firmly behind the jaws.  The hand takes the snake and
              puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white
              coverlet.  It slithers across the bed.
 
              The PROWLER's hand closes the window.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.

                      It still hurts?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt,
                      but I thought I could stand anything.
                            (pause)
                      I just wasn't ready for that kind of
                      pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A.
                      When I got back there, he sent a telegram
                      saying he was going back to his wife.
 
              BILL turns over so he can look at her better.
 
                                  BILL
                      What'll you do when you leave here?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.
 
              Various feet enter the FRAME.  BILL and ALICE look up to see
              JACK with his arm around MARCIE, NED toweling his head, and
              BRENDA putting on her blue workshirt.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe
                      and I are going back to work.
 
              BILL gets up.
 
                                  BILL
                      Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm
                      ready.  Frozen yogurt?

              ALICE smiles at the reference.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll be along.
 
                                  NED
                            (in a nelly voice)
                      Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll
                      scratch your eyes out...
 
              They head off.  ALICE turns over to tan her front.

              A machete rips through some vines.  Again it hacks at the brush.
 
              PULLS BACK to reveal BILL clearing away the years of vine
              growth which have choked off a path.  He wipes the perspiration
              from his eyes and continues along.

        51    EXT. BEHIND THE MAIN CABIN - DAY
 
              Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There
              are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's
              an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights
              made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.
 
              ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He
              explodes his breath.
 
              We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven
              parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt
              about his strength.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Not bad.
 
              As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat
              little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take.
 
                                  NED
                      Holy shit...
 
                                  BRENDA
                      We wouldn't want you thinking you're the
                      only show-off in camp, would we?

              The sun has dropped lower on the horizon.
 
              The CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the
              late sun.  A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with
              a start.
 
              CUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I didn't know I was asleep...What time
                      is it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Almost five.
 
              ALICE gets up.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Now I'm only eleven hours behind
                      schedule.  Steve is going to have a
                      small cow.
 
              They walk away from the shore.

        53    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              ALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen
              this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it.
 
                                  BILL
                      You can only do what you can do.
 
                                  ALICE
                      And then Steve looks at you with those
                      hurt eyes--like you don't care about
                      children...
 
              BILL laughs at her imitation.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      I'll see you later.
 
              She turns to go up the steps to her front door.
 
                                  BILL
                      Alice?
 
              She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares.

              ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it
              wasn't easy for BILL to say.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're very nice.
 
              They share a short silent moment.
 
                                  BILL
                      Hope you will.
 
              BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long
              blade.
 
              ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place
              to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin.

        54    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake
              is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
 
              ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
              been since we met her.
 
              The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
              dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light
              blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all
              the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
              in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
 
              ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
              she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
              sexier.  She smiles at herself.
 
              She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.
 
              ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens
              it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.
 
              She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.

              ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a
              towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for
              her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled
              hair fall down.
 
              She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails
              at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
              as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the
              bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake
              falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
 
              There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.
              Her scream is loud.

                                  ALICE (O.S.)
                      Help!
 
              BILL doesn't hesitate.  Carrying his machete, he runs to
              ALICE's cabin.
 
              MARCIE and JACK follow in the BG.

              ALICE is backed against the wall.  The snake could strike and
              get her.
 
              BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks
              at ALICE.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a tight whisper)
                      There's a fucking snake in here.

              BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.
              Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the
              machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto
              the floor.
 
              MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.
              MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further
              to see the blood and guts.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack,
                      would you get some paper towels?
 
              JACK nods and exits.
 
                                  ALICE
                      How the... did he get in there?
 
                                  BILL
                      Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of
                      your perfume.
 
              JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      You okay now?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
              BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly,
              stepping on MARCIE's big toe.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time.
                            (to JACK)
                      Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
 
              JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets
              underneath the wide-fanged snake.
 
              MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper
              toweling.

                      night and sucks our counsellor's body...
 
              ALICE leans against the sink and laughs.  She is a very pretty
              girl, younger than she first appeared.

                      And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor.
                      He says that whenever I'm scared, I can
                      sleep in his bunk with him.
 
              JACK and BILL laugh.
 
              NED takes off his headdress.

                      No wonder they lost America.  How could
                      you sneak around in the bushes wearing
                      that?  What's to eat?

              ALICE looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side.
              Does she sees something?
 
              The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder.
 
              The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but
              there is something standing there out by a cabin.  But it
              stands, doesn't move... Is it a building?
 
              CUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass.
              When we CUT BACK, the shape is gone.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  Curious.  A cold chill...
 
              ALICE looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about
              food.

              ALICE looks up.  Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room.
 
              The bulb does not light.
 
              ALICE pulls it again.

              JACK turns to BILL.
 
                                  JACK
                      Give me a hand?
 
                                  BILL

        61    INT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is
              standing.  The puddle is somehow significant.
 
              BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing.
 
                                  BILL
                      This is almost like the one at my
                      uncle's cabin in Maine.
 
                                  JACK
                      Here we go.
 
              The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we
              see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he
              concentrates.  He bites down on it.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine
              roars into action.
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Now ya' close the switch.
 
              CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal
              switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a
              perfect connection running through his body.  There is a
              sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
              screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are
              streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
              shoes.
 
              BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and
              continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
              at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-
              kick on his friend, severing the contact.

              JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The
              machine stops.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        62    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              JACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and
              cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his
              breathing.
 
              JACK shakes his head.
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll be okay.  Holy shit...
 
                                  BILL
                      Don't get up.  Take a second...
 
              JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm.
 
                                  JACK
                      You saved my life.
 
                                  BILL
                      I had to.
 
                                  JACK
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd
                      have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that
                      would have ruined my appetite.
 
              JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy
              athlete gets to his feet.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whew.
 
              Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and
              looks in.
 
              We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred
              switch and a now-silent generator.
 
                                  BILL
                      This puddle was enough to ground you all
                      the way to China.
 
              JACK looks in, too.

                                  JACK
                      Floor probably leaks.  This area is full
                      of springs.
 
                                  BILL
                      A short somewhere.
 
              BILL leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches
              another wire.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked
                      itself loose.
 
              He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU.
 
                                  JACK
                      Just in cause this bugger goes bad.  I'm
                      gonna pick up some lanterns from the
                      equipment shack.
 
              JACKS walks away.

              The door opens at us, letting in the limited light.  JACK comes
              in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp.  He flicks it on.
              As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the CAMERA
              slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets
              and knives.  They are all missing.
 
              JACK takes his booty and exits.
 
              The light is gone and we are alone in the dark.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              ECU of the lightbulb over the kitchen area.  It flickers on as

              JACK comes in with his lanterns followed by BILL.

              MARCIE is finishing up making her green California dip.
 
              Suddenly ALICE cries out.  Everybody whips around to see.
              ALICE holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a
              bottle.  She has cut her finger.  It is not a serious cut, but
              the blood is visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      This just plain ain't my day.
 
              BILL reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a BandAid.

                      Lemme see.  Doesn't look too bad.
 
              That said, the OTHERS go back to what they were doing.
 
              BILL and ALICE are featured even though we can hear the others.
              BILL takes great care and puts the BandAid on ALICE's finger.

              NEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE
              has just made.  He dips a chip as soon as she steps back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.
 
              Suddenly NED's face goes red.  His eyes bulge out.  He grabs
              his throat and gags.  Coughs, can't clear it.
 
                                  JACK

              NED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he
              writhes about.
 
                           MARCIE                        ALICE
                   Help him!                     Oh, my God!

              As BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich,
              NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.  It's a big finish:
 
                                  NED

              NED tries to laugh it off.  They shake their heads.  MARCIE
              walks away.  JACK looks at BILL.
 
                                  BILL
                      Chance to get even?
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll spot you five points.
 
                                  NED
                      Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it
                      again.
 
              NED turns and heads for the door.  ALICE comes up next to him.
              The OTHERS are out of earshot now.  BILL and JACK play a little
              ping-pong.  NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting
              stunt.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Ned?  We're gonna be working together
                      for a while.  You're a nice guy without
                      all the entertainment, okay?
 
              NED relaxes.  Nods.  He knows what she means.  He turns to look
              at the others.
 
                                  NED
                      Tell 'em I'm sorry?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.

                                  NED
                      I'm gonna go lie down and catch some
                      z's.  Today wiped me out.
                            (pause)
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're welcome.
 
              The CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.  In the BG,
              MARCIE speaks.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I hope that's the last time we see the
                      Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.

        65    EXT. MAIN CAMP AREA - EVENING
 
              We watch NED come away from the main cabin and walk moodily
              toward his cabin.
 
              The CAMERA stays with the troubled child as he stops, leans
              down, picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush.  It
              cuts through.  He flips a few stones in his hand.
 
              NED looks off.  Sees something.
 
              WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:  a shape--a human shape--standing by a
              cabin.
 
              NED walks towards it.
 
                                  NED
                      Hello?  Can I help you?

        66    INT. KITCHEN AREA - EVENING
 
              ALICE is just drying her hands.  She stands next to a giant
              stack of clean dishes and pots.
 
              BRENDA is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower
              and cucumber slices.
 
              BILL and JACK saunter in.
 
                                  JACK
                      You just had some lucky shots.

                                  BILL
                      Where's Ned?
 
                                  ALICE
                      He went to bed early.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I don't blame him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      He's probably setting up another one of
                      his practical jokes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Yeah, like draining the lake!
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  JACK
                            (to MARCIE)
                      Hey, how about a walk by the lake?
 
              The OTHERS all go "Ooooooooh."
 
                                  JACK
                            (continuing)
                      Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (kidding)
                      Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy
                      small-minded people around here.
                            (to JACK)
                      Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and
                      be right with you.
 
              MARCIE puts an arm through JACK's arm and they exit.
 
              The OTHERS laugh.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        67    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - NIGHT
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk across the pint needles towards the lake.
              There is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on
              the horizon.
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk along the shore to the lake.  They have
              turned on the flashlights which they carry with them.

                                  JACK
                      Wind's up.  It's shifted a good hundred
                      and eighty degrees.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
 
                                  JACK
                      I love you.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I love you.
 
              They kiss.  MARCIE pulls back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      What about Neddy?
 
                                  JACK
                      I don't love Neddy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Ned!
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Don't call him.
 
                                  JACK
                      I thought you wanted to give him one of
                      your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do
                      whatever he wants to do, you know.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I guess...
 
              The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light.
 
                                  JACK
                      Looks like a storm.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I'm a little scared of storms.  Always
                      have been.  Since I was a kid.
 
                                  JACK
                      You?  The brick?
 
              JACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie
              shadows.  She flashes hers at him.

                                  MARCIE
                      I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a
                      dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm.
                      The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can
                      hear the sound.  I try to close my ears
                      off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets
                      louder.  The rain turns to blood and the
                      blood washes down in little rivers.  And
                      the sound stops.
 
              A loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.  MARCIE is
              startled and reaches out for her lover.
 
                                  JACK
                      It's just a dream.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I call it my shower dream.
 
              They look at one another in the two lights.  They grin.  Rain
              drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them.
 
                                  JACK
                      This is no dream.  Want to escape for a
                      while?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Lead the way!
 
              JACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.  MARCIE is only
              a half step behind, laughing.
 
              FROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.  There is no theme,
              just the rumble of thunder...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        68    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and
              JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the
              nearest bed.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Are you wet?
 
                                  JACK
                      Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman.
 
              He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points
              straight up and gives them some light to see by.

              They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's
              hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up
              towards his head.  He leans back and takes it off, and tosses
              it at the CAMERA.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        69    EXT. FRONT OF MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The rain has gathered in intensity.  ALICE comes up to the
              front door and looks out.  BILL comes up behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
 
                                  BILL
                      Not if they're where I think they are.
 
              ALICE laughs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not always this stupid.
 
              She turned back into the cabin.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        70    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              TIGHT on JACK and MARCIE as they make love under a camp
              blanket.  Their breathing and noises are heard just above the
              sounds of the rain outside.
 
              The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have
              leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and
              dribbled down.  As the bed shakes with its love-making, the
              CAMERA PANS up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course.
 
              As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see
              NED lying in the upper bunk.  In a flash of lightning we
              realize he is dead:  his throat has been slashed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  JACK and MARCIE lie completely still beneath
              their blanket.  The CAMERA PANS along their quiet bodies.
              MARCIE's face is contented.  JACK is ready to doze off.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Mmmmmmmph?
 
                                  JACK
                      Mmmmmmmph.

                                  MARCIE
                      Best over...
 
                                  JACK
                      Umhummmmph.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Like waves.  It's never been likes waves
                      before.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whassamatta?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Gotta pee.  You're lying on my bladder.
 
              She rolls over and grabs her underpants and t-shirt.  While
              still on the bottom bunk, she puts herself into her limited
              clothing.  JACK gives her room.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (dressing)
                      I know this ain't very romantic, but
                      what can I say?  I don't want to explode.
 
              She grabs a flashlight, scoots to the door and is gone.
 
              JACK lies back and puts his hands under his hand.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        71    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT
 
              MARCIE runs across the now-wet central area towards the
              bathroom facility.  She tries to skip between the raindrops,
              but she knows she'll get a drenching.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        72    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              JACK rolls to his side, picks up a small hand-rolled cigarette
              and lights it.  He inhales deeply, rolls on his back.
              Something overhead catches his eye.
 
              Across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower
              stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors.
              We hear the toilet flush.
 
              We CUT INSIDE the toilet booth as MARCIE stands reading the
              graffiti to herself.  We can only see her from the chest up.

                                  MARCIE
                            (reading)
                      "Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie
                      Makit."  "The Yellow Stream by I.P.
                      Daley."  Not the most original stuff,
                      kids.
 
              There is a noise outside the stall.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?
 
              She hears no response and assumes that her imagination is
              playing tricks with her.  MARCIE picks up the flashlight and
              exits the stall.
 
        73    MARCIE crosses to the row of sinks, stops, puts the
              flashlight down and turns on the water faucet.  There is
              no water.

              PROWLER'S POV:  of MARCIE.
 
              From the end of the row of showers, we watch MARCIE bend under
              the sink and turn on one of the spigots.  Water rushes into the
              sink.
 
        74    MCU MARCIE:  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and
              turns off the water.  Again she hears a noise.  She looks
              to the row of showers and smiles.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Jack?
 
              The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut.
 
              MARCIE looks over, smiles.  She thinks someone is trying to
              scare her.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on.
 
              There is a dripping sound.  MARCIE stops at the first shower,
              hesitates.
 
              Throws back the first curtain.  There is no one there.  She
              reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off.
 
              She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the
              empty toilet.  Then reaches in to the shower curtain.

                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Allee allee infree!
 
              She throws back the curtain.  Again no one is there.
 
              She breathes a sigh of disappointment.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Must be my imagination.
 
              In CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the
              TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.  It happens in a flash.
              A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first
              shower.  A hatchet glints.  MARCIE screams.  The hatchet
              strikes.  The flashlight clatters to the floor.

              The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an
              establishing shot of the diner.  Through the window, which are
              being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS
              seated on stools at the counter.

              The WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly
              older, but still attractive.  She says good night to her
              CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the
              counter.  Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of
              coffee.  The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and
              tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Anything else you want?
 
                                  STEVE
                      No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy.
 
                                  SANDY
                      You can't go back there tonight.  Not in

                      I got to.

                                  SANDY
                      Aw.
 
              SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I have six new counsellor up there.
                      They're all babes in the woods in every
                      sense of the word.
 
                                  SANDY
                      They'll be okay if they know enough to
                      stay in outta the rain.
 
 
                      How much do I owe you?
 
                                  SANDY
                      One night on the town.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I mean...
 
                                  SANDY
                      ...I know what you mean.  Two and a
                      quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to
                      make up for me spending the night alone.
 
              STEVE pays up and walks to the cash register.
 
                                  SANDY
                            (continuing)
                      You got a roof for that Jeep?
 
              She rings up the money.  Gives him his change.  He hands her a
              tip.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Yeah.  I got it on before this--
                            (indicates the storm outside)
                      --all started.
 
                                  SANDY
                      That's thirty percent.
 
                                  STEVE
                      For two lonely nights.
 
              She smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that
              extra makeup.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb
                      self.

              STEVE smiles and leaves.  She watches, then counts her changes
              and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day.

              and starts it up.  He roars off through a big puddle, splashing
              water towards the CAMERA.  The Jeep pulls a small equipment

              ALICE enters from the kitchen, carrying two cups of coffee.
              She hands one to BRENDA, who is curled up on the couch in front
              of the fire.  BILL stands to the left of the hearth, picks up
              a couple of pieces of dry woods and puts them on to burn.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You think they fell asleep?
 
                                  BILL
                      Anything's possible.  My parents taught
                      me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      It wouldn't matter except Steve should be
                      getting back pretty soon.  It wouldn't
                      look so great if he fell over them.

                                  BILL
                      Good point.

                      Long enough for me.
 
              They laugh.

                      I think we should go wake them up.  Just
                      in case.

                      Give them a little while longer.  It's

              rid of the condensation.
 
              From his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay
              ahead of the rain.  Beyond them the headlights make a slight
              dent in the night.
 
              In the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is
              bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical

                      Got to it just in time.  The generator
                      was running on fumes.  I filled it up.
                      That should keep it humming until Steve
                      gets back.
 
              BRENDA gets up.

                      Good night, Brenda.
 
              BRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her
              head like a portable tent, she races off into the night.
 
              ALICE watches her go.  A glimmer of lightning outlines her as
              she heads off.
 
              BILL walks back into the big room, followed by ALICE.

              the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an
              examination lamp.  She takes out a toothbrush and some other
              toilet articles.
 
              She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.  She put her
              lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.  She
              stands up, and washes her hands and face.

              She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound
              that Marcie had heard.  BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls,
              shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.

              mirror.

              The SOUND is apparently coming from the front of the cabin;
              perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet.
 
              BRENDA grabs her slicker and heads out.
 
              The CAMERA FOLLOWS BRENDA through the darkened cabin to the
              front door.

              There is a small roof overhang like a porch, affording some
              protection from the wind and wet.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER:  as BRENDA hears the tapping sound
              closer by.  She looks and sees.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a
              string and left it dangling from the eaves.  The wind blows,
              making the knife tap against the building.

                                  BRENDA
                      Neddy?  Cut the screwing around, Neddy!
 
              She grabs the knife, breaking the string.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (continuing)
                      This isn't even half funny.
 
              Angry, BRENDA turns and goes back inside the cabin.

                      Christ, what a jerk.
 
              The single bulb goes out.

                      Great.  Now what?
 
              BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a
              match.  She fires up the propane lantern.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (continuing)
                      Looks like I turn in early.
 
              She moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed.  She
              reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear,
              revealing something that has been left there.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  Fear spreads across her face.
 
              REVERSE POV:  WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  A camp hatchet lies across
              her pillow.  The shiny blade is marked with blood.
 
              BRENDA turns and runs from her room.

              The softball field is now lit.  BRENDA is confused.  She looks

              runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind
              third base.  The CAMERA slowly zooms in on the darkness where
              BRENDA exited.  We hold on that spot for several seconds.
              Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.  Then
              another.

                      It sounded like Brenda.
 
                                  BILL
                      I'll go take a look.

                      Did somebody leave the lights on at the
                      softball field?
 
              We are looking over at her shoulder.  The distant glimmer
              suddenly goes dark.  BILL joins her and looks.

              ALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.  To the

              ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and
              comes up with a short 2x4.  She crosses to the door and smashes
              through one of the window panes.  She puts her arm through the
              broken glass, unlocks the door and enters.  BILL follows.
 
              The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.
              They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's
              desk.  BILL picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch

                      No.  There must be some in the desk
                      somewhere.
 
              They fumble through the desk to find some change.  BILL finds
              some in the postage drawer.  He then crosses over to a pay
              phone mounted on the wall.  The CAMERA moves to the cornice of
              the building where the phone line exits.  It follows the link
              up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and
              phone lines come in from the pole.  Here we see a dangling
              phone cable which has been recently cut.

              OVER, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead
              telephone.
 
                                  ALICE (V.O.)
                      Hello?  Hello?  This damn thing's dead,
                      too.

              BILL and ALICE comes out into the rain, heading for the camper
              van.  They hop in.

       108    EXT. VAN/PARKING LOT - NIGHT
 
              BILL slides behind the wheel.  The keys are in the ignition.
              ALICE hops in on the passenger side.
 
              BILL turns over the engine.  It grinds away but does not catch.
 
              From an ANGLE behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine
              fail to catch.  We look in the mirror and see someone standing
              in the distance, watching.
 
              BILL gets out of the driver's side.  Slams the door.  The
              CAMERA TRUCKS with him as he opens the door to the engine.
              ALICE joins him as he shines his light on the engine.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What's the matter with it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Wet.  I don't know.
 
              He tries a few more times.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Why don't we run?  Just run now?
 
                                  BILL
                      It's over twenty miles to the
                      crossroads.  Steve'll be back in an
                      hour.  Things will straighten out then.
                      We'll take his Jeep and get help.
 
              He goes to her and cradles her face in his hands.

                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      Don't worry.  There is probably some
                      really stupid explanation for all this.
                      When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll
                      smile.
                            (pause)
                      Promise.
 
              ALICE nods.

              In the FG we see a camp sign.  In the BG we see a figure
              running towards us.
 
              The figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as STEVE
              CHRISTY.  Just as he's about to make the turn into the
              driveway, he looks up and smiles.  He stops and catches his
              breath as the other person catches him in the light of a
              flashlight.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Hi.  What are you doing out in this mess?
 
              He shields his eyes from the light.

       112    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              BILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.  In the BG,
              ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.  On the coffee table in front
              of her is a large machete.

              BILL's eyes are closing.  He jerks himself awake, then starts
              to doze again.
 
              The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out.
 
              BILL snaps awake.  He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks
              it on.
 
                                  BILL
                      Oh, shit....
 
              He goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some
              lanterns.  He fires up a Coleman and places it on the pong
              table.
 
              BILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits,
              carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp.
 
              HOLD on ALICE's peaceful face as she slumbers.

              The rain has lessened a bit.  BILL approaches the shed with his
              fluorescent lamp and rifle.  He has the rifle at the ready.
 
              CU on his hand on the door handle.  He pulls it open.

              The generator stands there quietly.  BILL comes into view,
              spraying the interior with lamplight.
 
              In the FG a broken sparkplug which BILL does not see immediately.
              It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer.
 
              BILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.  He looks
              in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on.
 
              Then his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug.
              He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He
              puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed.

              ALICE sits up into the CAMERA, startled and afraid.

                                  ALICE
                      Bill?!
 
              She gets her bearings and looks around.  Stands up.  She looks
              at the bulb overhead.  Pulls its string.  No light.
 
              She sees the lanterns which have been placed around.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      The generator...
 
              Now that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a
              little.  Smiles.  She goes to the mantelpiece, takes the lantern,
              and walks into the kitchen.

              ALICE puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea
              kettle with water.  She puts it on the stove and pops on a
              burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee.
 
              Impatient and curious, she walks to the front door of the cabin
              and looks out.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?  Bill?
 
              The calm which she had grasped a few moments before is beginning
              to desert her.

              ALICE takes the kettle off the flame.
 
              The whistling stops abruptly.  ALICE pours water into the two
              cups.  She stirs the coffee.
 
              Unable to contain her impatience any longer, ALICE picks up her
              lantern, grabs a slicker, and heads out the door.

       119    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE walks very quickly around the side of the cabin, headed
              for the generator shed.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill!

       120    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT
 
              The door to the shed is closed.  ALICE looks around and then
              puts a hand on the hand.  In CU we see the hand pull.  The door
              doesn't budge.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE decides to pull harder.
 
              She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.  She pulls
              until she finally wrenches the door open.  The lamp casts long
              shadows upwards.
 
              The generator sits silent.
 
              ALICE leans into the shed to look.
 
              The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can
              see behind the right-hand corner of the building.  As we clear
              the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down
              from a branch above.
 
              The something turns slowly in the wind.  It is BILL--dead--in
              a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.
 
              ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?
 
              She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  She is riveted with horror, unable to
              move or turn or run.  The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME,
              the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.
 
              ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again.  She
              turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main
              cabin.

                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      Help!  Help!

       122    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete.
              It is not there.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The knife!
 
              She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it.
 
              LOW ANGLE:  as she scrabbles on all fours.  Nothing under the
              couch.
 
              ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the
              lamp.
 
              Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a
              window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass,
              shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.
 
              It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.
 
              ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front
              door.
 
              ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited
              figure.
 
              ALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.
 
              When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early
              forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.
              This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long
              enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently,
              pointing back to the rear window.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't
                      help you if you can't talk to me.
                      There, there now...
 
              ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.  In the BG we can see
              the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      He's dead... She's dead... all dead...
                      Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh
                      my God, oh my God... oh God...
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It will be all right.  I'll take care of
                      you.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack?  Marcie?  Ned?
 
              MRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It's just this place.  The storm.
                      That's why you're all upset.
 
                                  ALICE
                      No, no, they're all dead...
 
              ALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table
              without looking.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'll go look.
 
              ALICE's face registers the new terror.
 
                                  ALICE
                      They'll kill you!  Don't leave me!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'm not afraid.
 
              ALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to
              the back window.
 
                                  ALICE
                      All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie...

              ALICE stands close to the fireplace.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.  BRENDA's body
              sways just out of reach.  MRS. VOORHEES is shocked.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      Oh, my lord...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table,
              she picks up the lantern.
 
              ALICE waits at the fireplace.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      So young, so pretty.  What monster could
                      have done such a thing?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill--Bill--Bill is out there...
 
              She lets MRS. VOORHEES take her in her arms.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      We shall go straight to the police.
 
              ALICE backs up.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The killer is still out there.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I will protect you.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks around the room.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Oh, this place... It should never have
                      been a camp.  Not for children.  They
                      had so much trouble here.
 
              The fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace.  A log burns
              through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Camp Blood.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has almost completely calmed the girl down.
              Strokes her soft hair.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      You know a boy drowned the year before
                      those two others were killed?  An
                      accident?  It was inadequate supervision.
                      The counsellors were not paying enough
                      attention... They were making love when
                      that boy drowned.
 
              ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the
              YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.  The hand is missing its little finger!
 
              The THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like
              version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      We should go now.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No.  That won't be necessary.
 
              As she speaks, MRS. VOORHEES reaches into her slicker in a
              surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting
              knife.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't understand.
 
              MIXED on the TRACK, filtered, echoed and distant, is the SOUND
              of a ten year old boy, JASON, crying for help in a fantasy
              version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                            (filtered)
                      Help me, mommy... save me... please,
                      mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy...
                      save me....
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (cocking her hand to listen)
                      I am, Jason.  I am.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a little confused)
                      Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?

              MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.  While her
              voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip
              into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with
              the visibility of her weapon.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It was my son they killed.  They said he
                      drowned, but I know it was inadequate
                      supervision...
 
              ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.  She can't see the
              knife rise behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Mr. Christy will be back soon.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No, he won't.  I killed him as well....
 
              The shock of recognition hits ALICE.  In CU her eyes look up
              and see the knife which MRS. VOORHEES now has poised and ready
              to strike.
 
              ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the
              fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES stands and steps forward.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      I couldn't let them start this camp
                      again, could I?
 
              ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.  She grabs the fireplace
              poker.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I won't let you!
 
              ALICE swings the poker back and forth.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      No!  No!  No!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife.
              ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib
              cage.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage.
 
              ALICE drops the poker to run for the door.

              MRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE
              deliberately.
 
              Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       123    EXT. MAIN CABIN/TREE - NIGHT
 
              ALICE gets to the door and stops.  She fiddles with the side of
              the screen... somebody has latched it.
 
              CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at
              the door, snapping the latch.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the
              thunder and the lightning.  The THEME is going full-tilt as
              ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
 
              TWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from
              above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of
              STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under
              his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade
              protrudes from his heart.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair
              of legs which swing from the same big tree.
 
              STROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.  In the BG we
              see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance
              between herself and ALICE.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       124    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE runs for the door, slams through it.
 
              The CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       125    EXT. GENERATOR SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       126    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.  We hear the
              SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three
              bright overhead lights come on.
 
              ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to
              reveal her hiding place.
 
              She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it,
              then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few
              feet.
 
              She carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in
              CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Help, mommy, I'm drowning!  Oh, mommy,
                      please....
 
              The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of
              JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC.  She is both
              characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.
 
              ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the
              VOICE OF JASON.
 
              ALICE is very still.  Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS.
              VOORHEES rave.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Don't let me die, mommy... I can't
                      breathe... Help me, breathe...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is having trouble catching her own breath.  She
              strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the
              child stops.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (in her own voice)
                      I can't let them kill any more children.
                      Come out now.
 
              She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her
              way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the
              PROWLER.
 
              When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across
              her path like a barred door.  Before ALICE can think twice,
              MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that
              now ALICE is sandwiched between them.

              She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--
              the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
 
              ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.  On the shelf is a box.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.
              Her machete is coming up in an attack.
 
              ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of
              leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard
              as she can.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning
              knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low
              animal bellow.
 
              ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.
 
              ALICE gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out.
 
              We can hear JASON'S VOICE.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       127    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS/EQUIP. SHED - NIGHT
 
              The central area is bathed in light.  The rain has stopped.
              MRS. VOORHEES has turned on all the flood-lights.
 
              ALICE runs to the corner of one of the cabins.  She stops to
              look back.  MRS. VOORHEES is gaining on her.
 
              ALICE runs to the equipment shed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  The door is thrown back.  ALICE goes in.  Looks
              for a weapon.  Nothing is available.  ALICE sobs with fear.
              She runs.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES passes the equipment shed.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       128    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              A single bulb outside the building shows ALICE as she bursts
              through the door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       129    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              It is a small cabin.  On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.
 
              ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles
              from the wall.
 
              She rummages in a drawer.  It's empty.  She tries another.
              Empty.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Where are the goddamned bullets?
 
              The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it.
 
              ALICE looks around.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       130    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the
              rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt
              stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She
              turns.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,
              blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES
              steps slowly toward ALICE.
 
              ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only
              thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,
              swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the
              arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and
              drops to the floor.

              ALICE runs out the door.

       132    EXT. MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT
 
              ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the
              front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is
              no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs
              into the kitchen.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide.
              She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and
              then hides there, closing the door behind her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT
 
              There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.
              ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type
              which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
 
              ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
 
              As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.
              Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are
              turned on.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Please kill her, mommy... Help me,
                      please.  Kill her, mommy.
 
              There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the
              sound of another door being slammed.
 
              ALICE relaxes again.
 
              Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door
              now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the
              idea.
 
              She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are
              the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large
              skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
 
              ALICE covers her head with her arms.

              The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
              slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand
              finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is
              almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
 
              The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
 
                                  JASON (O.S.)
                      Come out, come out, wherever you are...
 
              ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
              room.
 
              Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Please...
 
              ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
 
              The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
 
              The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has
              begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
              door to the larder.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...
 
              At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see
              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's
              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
              anything...
 
              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.
              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near
              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
 
              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and
              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
              come through the entrance.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the
              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
              floor.

              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses
              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a
              small puddle of blood under her head.
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
              slowly out of the room.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       135    EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              The moon comes out from behind a cloud.  ALICE pushes a canoe
              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will
              permit, out in the lake to safety.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       136    EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Exhausted, ALICE puts her paddle across her lap and falls
              forward, slumped across a thwart.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       137    EXT. CAMP - DAWN
 
              The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the
              horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.  The birds are
              up, foraging for food.
 
              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky
              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe
              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the
              surface of the lake.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN
 
              ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not
              changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The
              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,
              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.
 
              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.

              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe
              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
              lapping water.
 
              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
 
              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES
              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get
              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle
              floating near her.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.
              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her
              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!
 
              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts
              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out
              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the
              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and
              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.
 
              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                            (continuing)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!
 
              ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
              one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
              off into the water.
 
              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
 
              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
              shore.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       139    EXT. CAMP ROAD/SIGN - MORNING
 
              ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.  We hear
              the sound of a car approaching.  Now it comes into view.  It is
              a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door
              that says "State Department of Health and Safety".  There are
              two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.
 
              ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.
 
                                  1st INSPECTOR
                      Good morning, miss.
 
                                  2nd INSPECTOR
                            (Leaning across the front seat)
                      Are you all right, ma'am?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Help me.
 
              The CAMERA PANS BACK while the two men get out of their vehicle
              and come around to help ALICE.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              LONG SHOT of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of
              Crystal Lake.  The canoe lies half sunken in the shallows.  One
              paddle drifts in the current.  The lake has swallowed its secret.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT

	CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

	Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

	EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT

	Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN 
	in tuxedo moves into:

	INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

	THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
	to the ballroom.

	ANGLE - COAT CHECK

	The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
	When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
	a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

	He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
	ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
	fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
	sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
	models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

	A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
	AID FOUNDATION"

	Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
	sets on another waiter's passing tray.

				ROBERTS (V.O.)
		Richard...

	DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
	of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

				ROBERTS
		Cancun. Nat just talked everybody 
		into it...

	A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

				KIMBLE 
		So, what's the deal? If the hospital 
		buys ten new -

				NAT
		No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
		Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
		has no ulterior motives.

				KIMBLE 
		On the house, huh?
			(to bartender)
		Tonic water with lime.

	Everyone agrees.

				KIMBLE 
		Never get me to sell my soul for one
		of those trips...

	His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

				KIMBLE
			(to Nat)
	 	... But if you get any more Bulls 
		tickets, Nat, give me a call.

	The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS

	KIMBLE

	Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary 
	golf swing.

				KIMBLE 
		You're slicing, Dave. Don't turn 
		your hip.

	He keeps moving.

				GOLFING MAN 
		Thanks, Richard...

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT

	KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
	elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
	T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

				DR. WAHLUND 
			(dripping sarcasm)
		I'm so glad you talked me into 
		coming, Richard... I can pick my
		cruise wardrobe.

				RICHARD 
		It's for a good cause, Kath... 
		Besides you need to get out of the
		lab more. Your electron microscope
		is starting to give you a tan.

	She smiles. He moves on.

	ANGLE - PARTY

	Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

				KIMBLE
		Hey, Jim.

	DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
	University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I just saw someone who 
		wanted to meet you...

	Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
	wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
	a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
	catch a look and hold it.

				NICHOLS (V.O.)
		Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
		is working on the RDU90 trials for 
		Devlin-Macgregor.

	Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
	smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

				LENTZ
		Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
		trading phone calls last few days 
		... something about a biopsy report 
		I returned to you?

				KIMBLE
			(suddenly attentive)
		Yeah... Three. Livers appeared 
		hepatetic to me.

				LENTZ
		I'll be in my office in the morning 
		and I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
		a good time for you?

				KIMBLE
		Sure.

				LENTZ
			(holds Kimble's look, 
			then to Nichols)
		See you, Jim.

	Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
	on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
	Nichols move together through the party.

				NICHOLS
			(digs in his pocket)
		Before I forget, I went by the garage
		this afternoon and picket up the 
		Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

	He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

				KIMBLE
		They fix it this time?

				NICHOLS
		We'll see.

	They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
	Kimble kisses her.

				NICHOLS
		You look fabulous, Helen.

	He kisses Helen.

				HELEN (WOMAN)
		Hello, Jim.

				NICHOLS
			(to Kimble)
		We've got a court tomorrow at three.

	Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

				KIMBLE
		Well, I've seen everyone, can we 
		leave?

				HELEN
		That would be a little abrupt, don't 
		you think?

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT

	A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
	others at table ant sit across from each other.

	Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
	mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
	OLDER WIFE.

	Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
	her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
	CONTINUE...

	INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
	changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
	of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
	catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
	his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
	ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
	of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
	"not yet."

	As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

	"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
	at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
	"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
	you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
	'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

	Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
	watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
	her head.

				NOW EAU WIFE
			(to table)
		I told my husband that he was going 
		to kill us if he didn't stop 
		operating. What with this AIDS thing, 
		he's putting us all at risk.

	Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
	a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

				HELEN
			(to her dinner partners)
		I'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
		home.

	They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
	shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we 
	see Lentz watching.

	INT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
	his hair as he drives.

				HELEN
		You looked handsome tonight...

				KIMBLE
		Thank you...

	He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
	for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

				HELEN
		Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
		like waiters...

				KIMBLE
		But me?

				HELEN
		You looked more like... a band 
		director.

	He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
	changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

				HELEN
		Are we home yet?...

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his 
	PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.

				KIMBLE
			(to phone)
		Dr. Kimble
			(suddenly attentive)
		When? Okay, tell them I'll be there 
		in ten minutes.

	He hangs up.

				KIMBLE
		Tim's got a problem.

	Helen kisses him again, opens the door.

				HELEN
		Call me on your way home.

	CREDITS END as we -

	CUT TO:

	INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down 
	stairs to the OR hall.

	He sticks his head into the operating room.

				KIMBLE
		Cavalry's here.

	Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

	SCRUB ROOM

	Kimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring 
	him up to speed.

				RESIDENT
		Patient is a male, forty-three. We 
		pulled his gall bladder and the 
		bleeding started.

				KIMBLE
		What's his pro time?

				RESIDENT
			(concerned)
		He's at 36 seconds. We got a major 
		bleeder in here.

				KIMBLE
		You talk to the family?

				RESIDENT
		None. He's off the street.

	CUT TO:


	INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

	Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with 
	trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble 
	is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both 
	working so intently they never look at each other as they 
	talk...

				KIMBLE
			(to Anesthesiologist)
		Okay... I'm clamping. Can he 
		tolerate it?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		He's a very sick guy.

				KIMBLE
		Do we have a choice?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		Go for it.

				KIMBLE
		Marie, give me a clamp...

	MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble 
	and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident 
	assisting.

				KIMBLE
			(never looking up)
		Your husband know you're here tonight,
		Marie?... What about this liver?

				RESIDENT
		History's sketchy. Could be an 
		alcoholic.

				KIMBLE
		Who referred him?

				RESIDENT
		He's on a drug protocol. RDU90.

	Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident 
	over their masks, then back to work.

				KIMBLE
		The wave of the future... Marie, you 
		told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous 
		of this late night thing we've got 
		going here... This should hold him. 
		Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a 
		biopsy...
			(to circulating nurse)
		Send it downstairs and make sure you 
		get Kath her slice.

				SURGEON
		You staying for the closing, Rich?

	Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

				KIMBLE
		No. I got a date.

	INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind 
	him; it is the other Surgeon.

				SURGEON
		Hey, Richard...

	Kimble turns.

				SURGEON

	Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

	Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on 
	the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close 
	one of the interior closet doors.

	She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

	A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
	claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her 
	string of pearls bursts...

	... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls 
	across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from 
	the top.

	A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on 
	the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and 
	calls up the stairs.

				KIMBLE
		I'm home. Did you hear who won the 
		Bulls game?

	No answer. He steps into the:

	KITCHEN

	The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The

	Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
	he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
	Adrenal surge.

	Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
	free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
	The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
	leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
	sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
	landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
	hall below.

	SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

	The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
	catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
	shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

	Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
	Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
	face...

	The SIRENS are LOUDER...

	Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
	down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

	Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped 
	by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

				HELEN (O.S.)
		He's here... still in the house...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one 
	hand, her head with the other.

				911 (V.O.)
		Did I hear you right? Your attacker 
		is still in the house? Ma'am?

				HELEN
		He's trying to kill me...

	Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.

				911 (V.O.)
		Will you repeat that please?

				HELEN
			(to Kimble)
		Richard... He's trying to kill me... 
		my head.


	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly 
	to the house.

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she 
	was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her 
	leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

				KIMBLE
		Hang on, babe... going to be all 
		right.

	Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

				HELEN
		My head. Richard my hold me.

	Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her 
	head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes 
	she won't be all right.

	CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

				911 (V.O.)
		... Hello. You said his name is 
		Richard? Ma'am, can you talk to me? 
		Ma'am?

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The Cops enter the house. See the .38 lying on the floor. 
	Covering each other, they move quickly up the stairs - guns 
	drawn.

	Third floor. The First Cop, gun drawn, turns the corner of

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Kimble, numbed by the event, washes the blood off his hands 
	in the kitchen sink. A cop takes his blood-stained tux 
	jacket, and another hands him a parka.

	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious 
	neighbors, television news vans, etc.

	Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van 
	arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.

				DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
		Can you give us a little more to go 
		on besides the fact that he had an 
		artificial arm? What kind of gun was
		it, Doc?

	INT. 11TH STREET DISTRICT HOUSE - NIGHT

	CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" 
	shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: 
	KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, 
	aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

				KIMBLE
		It was .38... I think. I only saw it 
		for a second. I knocked it out of 
		his hand.

	As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the 
	murder scene being processed:

	FLASH - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Forensics technicians photograph the .38 at the base of the

	DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
	Your wife was loaded wasn't she? I mean, she was worth quite 
	a bit of money.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems 
	to sense something aggressive in their questioning.

	They no longer seem on the same team.

				KIMBLE
		What's going on here? This guy was 
		trying to rob us.

	The two cops stare at Kimble.

				KIMBLE
		You guys have got to be out of your 
		minds. I didn't kill my wife!

	He gets up to go. A cop blocks his path. He turns and looks 
	at Kelly.

				DETECTIVE KELLY
		Let's start over, Dr. Kimble. What'd 
		you have for breakfast?

		I know what I saw, Walter.

				GUTHERIE
		I put you up on the stand to say what

		Look, Richard, you're paying us a

		I didn't kill my wife.

	INT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - DAY

	Kimble being escorted back to the courtroom. A guard carries

	On the other side of the door is the courtroom. A sheriff's

	KIBLE'S POV - THE JURY

	A few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken 
	out of context.

	NICHOLS ON THE STAND

				PROSECUTOR
		Dr. Nichols. You are aware that 
		Richard Kimble was the only 
		beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate.
		12 million dollars roughly.

				NICHOLS
		I was aware of that. The money meant 
		nothing to him.

				PROSECUTOR
		Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
		once said that 'if he had Helen's 
		money he could find plenty of uses.'
		Did he not?

				NICHOLS
		We were talking about -

				PROSECUTOR
		Yes or no?

	Nichols' look tells us everything... Yes.

	CUT TO:

	CORONER

	On the stand.

				CORONER
		The wound to the head caused a 
		massive hemorrhage to the brain. It 
		took from five to seven minutes for 
		her to die...

	A woman in the jury reacts. Kimble notices.

	KIMBLE

	On the stand. He finishes his moving description of the 
	events. We see some of the jury has been moved.

				KIMBLE
		... And I was holding her when the 
		officers came in.

	Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the 
	jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

				PROSECUTOR
		How tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?

				KIMBLE
		I can't be sure. We were, mostly on 
		the floor, fighting... I couldn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Did that fight cause the scratches 
		on your face and arms?

				KIMBLE
		No. As I explained -

				PROSECUTOR
		And how did this man enter your 
		house?

				KIMBLE
		I don't know -

				PROSECUTOR
		And you probably don't know why your 
		wife told the emergency operator You 
		were her attacker?

				KIMBLE
		She didn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Your name is Richard, isn't it? Your 
		gun is a .38, isn't it? Your prints 
		were on the gun, the bullets, the 
		lamp, her neck, weren't they?

				KIMBLE
		Look...

				PROSECUTOR
		Weren't they?

	CUT TO:

	INT. COURTROOM - DAY

	Richard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a 
	shadow of the man we knew before, stares ahead passively as 
	Judge Bennett delivers the sentencing to hushed courtroom.

				JUDGE BENNETT
		After careful and studied review of 
		all evidence presented during each 
		phase of this proceeding, and 
		because aggravated circumstances, 
		detailed at length, were present 
		the night of January 20th.

	Kimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence 
	shockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear 
	doors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's 
	satisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, 
	lowers his head. Disbelief.

	ANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE

	He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by 
	bailiff. Gutherie whispers an "I'm sorry." Kimble doesn't 
	hear it.

				JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
		Therefore, it is the decision of 
		this court...

	Looks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom. Faces 
	stare back.

	INT. KIT ROOM - DAY

	Judge Bennett's V.O. CONTINUES over:

	CLOSE ON CUFFS

	Slapped down over wrists, ratcheting down tight.

	Ankle cuffs dragged out. Pant legs raised, canvas shoes

	CHAINS RATTLED out. Snaked across the floor. Looped around 
	waists and locked to handcuffs to form belly chains.

	EXT . SALLY PORT (COOK COW TY JAIL) - NIGHT

	The chain gang exits through the sally port. Kimble and

	Locking wire mesh cage inside bus.

	An old DIESEL COUGHS to life.

	EXT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

	Main gates open. The BUS GRINDS onto the streets.

	INT. BUS - DAY

	The four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer 
	chained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing...

	The two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG 
	GUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns 
	bouncing on their knees. Prisoner #l shifts his gaze to...

	The driver. Pistol on his hip.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging:

				PRISONER #1
		Hey. Illinois penal regulations 
		require a meal for transport
		rides of four hours or more.

	Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
	Checks his watch: 4:00.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Jack! Feedin' time.

	Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
	belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

	PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
	the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
	aisle...

	PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
	between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
	CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
	plastic shank.

	Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
	handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
	a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

				COPELAND
		Breathe, and you're first.

	Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
	carelessly ready.

	Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
	doesn't respond.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Suit yourself.

	He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
	sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

	Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

				KIMBLE
		Look out!

	Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
	Young Guard's gut.

	Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
	out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

	Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
	floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
	inside, but...

	Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
	Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under
	the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

	The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard.

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	As the bus careens off the road, accelerating.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing
	prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard.

	Old Guard shotgun-butts Prisoner #1, flips the gun, PUMPS 
	ONE ROUND into the man's chest. Dead. He turns just as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat.

	Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the 
	Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes 
	off target as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
	and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the 
	bottom of a small ravine.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

	On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
	him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
	at...

	Kimble. Rising between the seats.

	A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
	off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

	Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
	find Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
			(to Kimble)
		You. You're a doctor. C'mere.

	He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
	medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

				OLD GUARD
		Do something.

	Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
	his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
	Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
	Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

				KIMBLE
		He isn't going to make it unless he 
		gets to a hospital. Fast.

				OLD GUARD
		ZL.

	In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it 
	just settling?

	With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
	Guard's bleeding.

	ANGLE UNDER SEAT

	We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
	back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the 
	opening.

	BACK TO KIMBLE

	A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
	retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
	growing vibration.

				KIMBLE
		Just where the hell are we?

	The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
	looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

				OLD GUARD
		Oh, shit...


	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
	grows bright by the light of an approaching train.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges 
	to his side.

				KIMBLE
		It's locked. Where're your keys?

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young 
	Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles 
	the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

	The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
	snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

				KIMBLE
		Which one? This? This one?!

	Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
	the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

				KIMBLE
		Help me get him -

	But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out 
	the shattered windshield.

	ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS

	Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...

	EXT. BUS - NIGHT

	... and hits the ground running the other way. The 
	locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should 
	Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard 
	hold a look.

	EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT

	As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard 
	behind him. He slings the man clear.

	SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

	For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

	The train light X-rays him.

	Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
	away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
	dozen mincing steps before...

	IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
	splitting it open.

	Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
	feet, still running feverish half-steps.

	An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
	flanks.

	The train burns past the wounded Guard.

	Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
	him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

	Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
	after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
	chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

	The train burrows to a stop.

	Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
	of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
	nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
	something in his hand.

	It's the key-ring.

	EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. 
	Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		Give me that.

	Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
	own chains.

				COPELAND
		You listen to me. I don't give a 
		damn which way you go, just don't 
		follow me.

	Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his 
	arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the 
	other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT

	News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing 
	smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines 
	hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work 
	feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled 
	wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation 
	investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted 
	remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

	Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. 
	marshals emerge:

	BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick 
	shithouse.

	RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds 
	fully-equipped.

	POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during 
	nut-cuttin' time.

	NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

	From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media 
	spectacle.

				GERARD
		Good lord...

				REFRO
		What is this... a circus?

	As a group they begin moving along the service road above 
	the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below 
	them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they 
	walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

	Biggs spots something...

				BIGGS
		Point of impact.

	... and branches off.

				GERARD
		Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.

				BIGGS
		Shit.
			(to Newman)
		Come on.

	They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain 
	with Gerard.

	A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he
	sees Gerard's Marshall star.

				GERARD
		How ya doing? Who's in charge?

				TROOPER
		Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the 
		lights -

	Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the 
	scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

	Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
	about to happen.

	ANGLE - OLD GUARD

	Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
	shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
	SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote 
	news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the 
	b.g., listening.

				OLD GUARD
		... train was bearin' down on us, 
		fast. I don't know how - it's still 
		kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
		and pushed him out of the bus.

				SHERIFF
		You coulda both been killed.

				OLD GUARD
		I know, but hell, he's my partner.
		Woulda done the same for me.

	The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard 
	eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

				GERARD
		Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy 
		U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.

				SHERIFF
			(annoyed)
		I'll be with you in a minute.

	The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
	his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos 
	of all four prisoners.

				SHERIFF
			(to Old Guard)
		For the record. These three dead. 
		And this one...

	He switches to a photo of Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
		Well, everything happened so fast...
			(bites lip, decides)
		Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

	Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred 
	prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

				SHERIFF
		You get some rest.

	He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

				SHERIFF
		Looks like you came a long way for 
		nothing. My men've already done a 
		thorough search from point of 
		impact and found nothing.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	ANGLE - CULVERT

	Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees 
	something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

	GERARD

	Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

				GERARD
		With all due respect, may I suggest 
		check-points starting at a 15-mile 
		radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east 
		of -

				SHERIFF
		Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? 
		Prisoners are all dead. The only 
		thing check-points will do is get a 
		lot of good people out here frantic 
		and flood my office with calls.

	Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and 
	we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

				GERARD
			(beat)
		Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for 
		that to happen... So, I'll be 
		taking over the investigation.

				SHERIFF
		On whose authority?

				GERARD
		By authority of the Governor of the 
		State of Illinois and the office of
		the United States Marshal, 5th 
		District Northern Illinois...

	Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents 
	from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

				SHERIFF
			(back-down beat)
		Okay. You want jurisdiction over 
		this mess, you got it.
			(to assistants)
		Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
		mop up for us.

	He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
	Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
	manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

	Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
	a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

				GERARD
		Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
		back and give this poor man some 
		room.

	Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a 
	change of story and command.

	Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the 
	Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

				GERARD
			(friendly, to Old 
			Guard)
		Always an interesting thing when we 
		find leg irons and no legs in them 
		who held the keys, sir?

				OLD GUARD
		Uh, me.

				GERARD
		Would you be so kind as to show them
		to me, sir?

	Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

	The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the 
	press hovering just out of earshot.

				GERARD
		Second chance.

	Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

	The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

				OLD GUARD
			(cracking)
		He mighta got out.

				GERARD
		Thank you.

				SHERIFF
		What the hell is this? A minute ago 
		you tell me he's part of the 
		wreckage, now you're -

				GERARD
		Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want 
		an accurate body count. Poole - Set 
		up operations right here.

	He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving 
	downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like 
	Israelites behind Moses.

				GERARD
		Ladies and gentlemen... our 
		fugitive's been on the run for 
		ninety minutes. Average foot speed 
		over uneven ground - barring injury 
		is approximately four miles an hour, 
		giving us a radius of six miles. I 
		want a hard-target search of any 
		residence, gas station, farmhouse, 
		henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in 
		that area. Check-points go up at 
		15 miles.
			(to media)
		You got that? Good. Now, turn 
		those damn things off and get out 
		of our way.

	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a
	dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

	EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

	Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. 
	The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment 
	later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

	EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with 
	blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's 
	going to need stitches.

	Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps 
	moving.

	EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN

	Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction 
	of the lights.

	A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the 
	road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 
	mile.

	ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM

	Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
	nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
	He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
	jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
	breath.

	Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
	the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
	cover behind the wrecked car.

	The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
	seat and closes the door.

	He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
	something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
	and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the 
	coveralls missing from the seat.

	As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
	side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
	clutching the coveralls.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN

	A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the 
	crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone 
	lines are pulled down from the lines running along the 
	tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

	Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and 
	relays it to Gerard.

				POOLE
		Blood trail found. Two miles 
		southwest.

				GERARD
			(to Biggs)
		Type it and match it against all 
		four prisoners.
			(to Renfro)
		Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to 
		every local hospital.
			(to Newman)
		Newman...

	Newman appears.

				NEWMAN
		Yes, sir...

				GERARD
		I need some coffee.

	As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING 
	from the train crash.

	ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH

	A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

				WORKER
		Hey, one's alive!

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

	Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food 
	outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck 
	operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. 
	Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

	A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a 
	bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us.
	Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front 
	of the doorway.

	KIMBLE'S POV - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM

	CUT TO:

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble closes the door and locks it. Hanging on the back of 
	the door we see a doctor's white coat.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

	An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside.

	CUT TO:

	CLOTH-COVERED INSTRUMENT TRAY

	On it we see: A packaged sterilized bandage, an opened 
	antiseptic wash, an opened topical anesthetic, and an empty 
	syringe. We PULL BACK to find:

	KIMBLE

	His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches 
	already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as 
	he sutures himself.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LONG SHOT (MOS) - MORNING

	At far end of the hall we see a STATE TROPER chatting with a 
	DUTY NURSE at a nurses' station.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROCEDURE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot 
	of antibiotics.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY

	A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes 
	closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.

	KIMBLE
	Can you hear me, sir?

	No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the 
	patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his 
	clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched 
	breakfast tray.

	CUT TO:

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - NURSES' DUTY STATION - DAY

	The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins 
	coming through on DESK FAX.

				NURSE
		There's your fax...

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble dressing in the man's clothes. He eats a piece of 
	toast - part of the man's breakfast - as he buttons up his 
	shirt.

	ANGLE - PATIENT

	His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call 
	button.

	CUT TO:

	INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

	A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the 
	duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the 
	patient's call light comes on.

	The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the 
	patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the 
	patient's room.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the 
	patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

				DUTY NURSE (O.S.)
		Mr. Patterson, do you need some more 
		water?

	ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST

	The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.

				DUTY NURSE
		... Oh, you did a good job on this.

	She takes his empty plastic pitcher and...

	... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and 
	refills the pitcher from the sink.

				DUTY NURSE
			(over her shoulder, 
			to patient)
		... It does get dry in here, doesn't 
		it?

	She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes 
	into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind 
	it.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and 
	a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency 
	room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the 
	E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts 
	down the corridor toward Kimble.

	The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

				TROOPER
		'Scuse me, Doc?...

	Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. 
	doors behind him.

				TROOPER
		... Don't know if you heard or not 
		but we're looking for an escaped 
		prisoner from that bus train wreck 
		'couple hours ago. Thought he might 
		show up here if he was hurt.

				KIMBLE
		What's he look like?

	The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow 
	trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down 
	Kimble's cheek.

				TROOPER
			(from fax sheet)
		Approximately six one, 180 pounds, 
		brown hair, brown eyes and beard.

	At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes 
	it clean as the Trooper looks up.

				TROOPER
		... Seen anyone that fits that 
		description?

				KIMBLE
		Every time I look in the mirror ...
		but without the beard.

	They laugh.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me...

				TROOPER
		Sure.

	Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks 
	outside...

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY

	Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The 
	lead wheels are stuck.

				KIMBLE
		Here...

	Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney 
	comes free.

				PARAMEDIC #2
		Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out 
		from under a train.

	As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face 
	of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

				YOUNG GUARD
		It's him... It's -

	Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young 
	Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

				KIMBLE
		How is he?

	The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

				PARAMEDIC #1
		He's pretty bad off. Broken leg, 
		ribs. Concussion.

	As Kimble moves away...

				KIMBLE
		Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got 
		a perforated spleen.

	He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk 
	the Young Guard inside.

				PARAMEDIC #2
			(impressed)
		Jesus, how could he tell that from 
		looking at his face?

	ANGLE - AMBULANCE

	Kimble climbs behind the wheel.

	EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	A full communications link is in place.

	Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information 
	to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole 
	calls Gerard.

				POOLE
		Background just came in from 
		Chicago.

				GERARD
		Hit me.

	Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of 
	information comes clear and fast.

				RENFRO
		Richard David Kimble. Vascular 
		Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree 
		murder in the killing of his wife. 
		Pleaded innocent. Claimed a 
		one-armed -

				GERARD
		Let's not retry the case. Priors
		and accomplices?

	Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the 
	investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.

				RENFRO
		None. No previous arrests.

	Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard 
	unzips his fly and relieves himself.

				GERARD
		Sealed juvie record?

	Poole calls out from behind tree.

				POOLE
		Nothing. Total cherry.

				GERARD
		Relatives? Children?

				RENFRO
		No relatives.

				POOLE
		One child. A son. Died in drowning 
		accident three years ago.

				GERARD
		Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends? 
		Combinations of the above?

				POOLE
		Lot of friends. Doctors. Hospital 
		staff.

	Gerard zips up.

				GERARD
		Start there. Authorize taps. Cover
		his lawyer first.

				RENFRO
		Never get it.

				GERARD
		Bet me.

	Renfro won't take it.

				GERARD
		Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, 
		he'll sign 'em.

	... Biggs charges up the hillside.

				BIGGS
		DeLange Hospital. Wounded guard 
		swears to High Holy he saw Kimble 
		right there in the hallway. 
		Ambulance, missing too.

	ANGLE - SITUATION TENT

	Gerard moves quickly to the map.

				GERARD
		Give me a time.

				BIGGS
		O-nine-thirty. Twenty minutes ago.

	Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we 
	covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn, 
	tightened, with the hospital as its center. The 
	triangulation is set.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. RURAL RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

	The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad 
	crossing.

				COP (V.O.)
		... We're waiting up here in Canton.
		Wondering if you heard anything on 
		this Kimble chase -

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad 
	crossing. The biocom monitors police chatter:

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		Two-twelve-A, be advised that all 
		discussion on this matter is to be 
		conducted on a tactical frequency 
		- either Channel K or Z. Over.

	Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield:

	ROAD SIGN

	An arrow points toward Canton, two miles.

	The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal 
	suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops 
	the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and 
	heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets 
	attention.

	INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

	Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and 
	reaches for his C.B. radio.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

	Poole hangs up phone.

				POOLE
		Ambulance just spotted two miles 
		west of Doverville. Heading north 
		on State road 53.

	Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much 
	smaller.

				RENFRO
		Running outta map, Sam.

	The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is 
	ready to move.

				GERARD
		Just the way we want it. Okay, 
		people, let's button up.

	They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and 
	eyeballs folded roadmap...

	EXT. SECONDARY ROAD (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the 
	Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.

	EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and 
	G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of 
	Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS 
	overhead.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance. 
	Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain.

				PILOT
			(into radio)
		We've got a visual...
			(to Gerard)
		He's heading toward the viaduct.

				GERARD
		Seal it up.

	EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY

	The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred 
	feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.

	The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into 
	the tunnel.

	ON KIMBLE

	Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at 
	the mouth of the tunnel.

	Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.

	ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)

	Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far 
	entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.

	ANGLE HELICOPTER

	Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.

	KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE

	Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. 
	Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.

	EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking 
	the other end.

	Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a 
	State patrol car blares:

				P.A. (V.O.)
		Please remain in your vehicles and 
		lock your doors. Repeat, please 
		remain in -

	ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

	Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar. 
	They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a 
	vest.

				RENFRO
		Got him.

	Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.

				GERARD
		Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard 
		part's over.

	He starts into the tunnel.

				RENFRO
			(to radio)
		We're movin' in.

	INT. TUNNEL - DAY

	Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three 
	silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' 
	P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb 
	back inside and lock their doors.

	Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the 
	middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

	Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the 
	ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain 
	clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

	Running water.

	ON MARSHALS

	They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks 
	around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks 
	confused.

				POOLE
		Where'd he go?

	Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until 
	he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.

				GERARD
		Biggs, Renfro with me.

	INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows 
	at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. 
	A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips 
	off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues 
	straight ahead.

	Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit
	wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong 
	to...

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the 
	forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

				GERARD
		Channel Three.

	They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go 
	left. Gerard - straight ahead.

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy 
	downslope.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Biggs and Renfro. Sweeping his light as he advances. 
	Searching for splash-patterns.

				BIGGS
			(into shoulder-mike)
		Nothing yet.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard. Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light. About to 
	pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the 
	branch-off tunnel. Hand marks?

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Got a possible here. Stand by.

	He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with 
	three limbs

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. 
	Slips again...

	... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

	Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. 
	Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
	lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
	there first.

	It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
	flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

				KIMBLE
		I didn't kill my wife.

				GERARD
		So, you didn't kill your wife.

	Not my problem.

	An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
	silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

				BIGGS (V.O.)
		Gerard? You there?

	Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

	Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up 
	piece.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro 
	appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...

				GERARD
		Straight ahead!

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance 
	in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead 
	lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is 
	incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and 
	stops.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam 
	disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of 
	mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

	He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.

	ANGLE - MARSHALS

	Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a 
	shooting stance.

				GERARD
		Turn around, hands over your head. 
		And get down on the ground.

	For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

				GERARD
		Your choice, Kimble...

	Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
	water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
	up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
	water toward Kimble.

				GERARD
		Get down on your knees.

	Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the 
	footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY

	Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap 
	into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into 
	the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

	INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY

	Renfro lowers his gun.

				RENFRO
			(amazed)
		Son of a bitch...

	It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

	ON GERARD

	He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He 
	stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him 
	something invaluable about this fugitive.

	EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY

	Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam 
	near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search 
	helicopter converge on the site.

	EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

	Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

	The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down 
	stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET

	Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the 
	shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

	Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

	FROM SHORE

	Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
	the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
	ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Running out of daylight, Inspector.

				GERARD
		Lights and generators are coming, 
		Captain.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Look, I don't mean to tell you your 
		job, but maybe one person in a 
		million could've survived that fall.
		The guy's fish food.

	Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

				GERARD
		Then find me the fish that ate him.

	He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

	EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

	Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a 
	sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, 
	exhausted.

	KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY

	ANGLE

	Helen in bed. Kimble's hand comes INTO FRAME and touches 
	her shoulder. She turns toward Kimble as he moves INTO

	Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He 
	remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.

	EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING

	Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into 
	tunnel.

	INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

	Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for 
	party 
	to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

	Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

	ANGLE - PHONE

	Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear 
	RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan 
		and Wainwright.

				KIMBLE
		Walter Gutherie please.

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left 
		for the day, would you like his 
		voice mail?

	Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front 
	of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the 
	shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he 
	sees the pharmacist looking at him.

	EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a 
	new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, 
	moves down the road to the diner.

	INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER 
	WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and 
	tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need to look at the menu?

				KIMBLE
		Some soup, please.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Good choice.

	She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around 
	Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

	A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
	stares at him.

	A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
	away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
	he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

	Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
	his soup. Where's the first waitress?

	Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
	sees:

	The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
	going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

	A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

	ANGLE - TV

	A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the 
	chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death 
	from the fall.

	Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on 
	the counter and exits.

	EXT. DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until 
	he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of 
	the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

	Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both 
	sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly 
	hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
	faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
	a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
	inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
	chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
	looks at himself. He's shaking.

	A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next 
	to him, passenger window rolls down...

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need a ride?

	Kimble stares at her.

				KIMBLE
		Which way are you going?

	She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. 
	They hold a look as we hear:

				RENFRO (V.O.)
		We feel confident about the I.D.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

	A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless 
	woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly 
	down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just 
	early morning traffic.

	We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the 
	street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
	that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
	woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
	radio.

				RENFRO
		Local officials were about to wet 
		their pants to move in.

				GERARD
		I bet they were.
			(to radio)
		Where's the woman?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	BIGGS

	In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

				RENFRO
			(into radio)
		Same room.

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and 
		Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. 
		I don't want anyone hurt. Stay 
		outside unless called. Radios on 
		three.

	The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his 
	service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.

				NEWMAN
		Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?

				GERARD
		Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
		Let's go.

	EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAWN

	DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of 
	the door.

				GERARD
		U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!

	INT. HOUSE - DAWN

	Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

	THEIR POV

	Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
	OF VIEW.

	A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

	GERARD

	Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
	room while he moves down the main hall into the back 
	bedroom.

	ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN

	Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
	off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
	He steps into -

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
	the bedroom.

	HALLWAY

	Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
	continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
	woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
	silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
	opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
	the doorway to the kitchen.

	Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
	He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
	Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

	CUT TO:

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
	didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

	COPELAND

	Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
	Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
	knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
	room.

	We...

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		I got your man! Now I want outta 
		here!

	Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
	woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
	fugitive.

	ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN

	Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
	through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

	LIVING ROOM

	Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
	his throat.

				COPELAND
			(to Gerard)
		You hear me? I said, I want out or 
		I'll cut your man's throat!

	GERARD

	Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
	at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

	LIVING ROOM

	Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
	hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

	Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
	whips Newman around and we see:

	A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
	late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

	He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
	The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
	stunned but unhurt.

	Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
	bedroom doorway.

				GERARD
		Shut up.

	She does. Immediately.

	EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

	As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
	the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
	sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
	hysterical, clutching his ear.

				NEWMAN
		My ear... I can't hear a thing out 
		of it. I can't believe you did that!

				GERARD
		You think I should have bargained 
		with him, don't you?

				NEWMAN
		Yes. You could've missed! You 
		could've killed me!

				GERARD
		Yeah, you're absolutely right. I 
		could've.

	They hold a look.

				GERARD
		How bad's your ear?

				NEWMAN
		Terrible. I probably have permanent 
		hearing damage.

				GERARD
		Let me see it.

	Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

				GERARD
		I don't bargain.

	Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
	unsettling man Gerard is.

	EXT. CHICAGO PAY PHONE - MORNING

	Kimble makes call. While he waits for phone to be answered 
	TRAINS COME and GO in the b.g. An EL CROSSES OVERHEAD. The 
	BELLS of Chicago River DRAWBRIDGE.

				KIMBLE
		Walter. It's Richard.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. LAW OFFICES OF GUTHERIE, MORGAN AND WAINWRIGHT - DAY

	Walter Gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking 
	Lake Michigan.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard... Jesus, why did you run? 
		Running only makes you look guilty.

				KIMBLE
		I wasn't worrying about appearances, 
		Walter.
	
				GUTHERIE
		Tell me where you are. I'll come
		meet you so you can turn yourself 
		in .

				KIMBLE
		I'm not turning myself in. I need 
		money.

	Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on 
	the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard. You're asking me to harbor
		and aid a convicted felon... I can't
		help you that way. My advice - both 
		as a friend and as your legal counsel 
		- is for you to give yourself up. 
		Now tell me... where are you?

	Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

				KIMBLE
			(beat)
		St. Louis.

				GUTHERIE
		Give me an address. I'll be -

	CLICK. Gutherie hears the LINE GO DEAD. Kimble's gone.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

	his next move. Then seeing bank clock flash the time: 9:30 -
	he knows what that move is.

	INT. NORTH BANK TENNIS CLUB - DAY

	An upscale mid-town tennis club. Behind glass windows of 
	the entryway we see tennis courts. From the courts comes Dr. 
	Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his 
	tennis bag. A friendly DESK ATTENDANT Sharon) smiles as he 
	goes by.

				DESK ATTENDANT
		See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?

				NICHOLS
		Creature of habit, Sharon.

	EXT. NORTH BANK CLUB - DAY

	Dr. Nichols leaves the club. He tosses his gym bag into the 
	back of his car and drives off.

	INT. / EXT. NICHOLS'S CAR - DAY

	As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves 
	toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield. 
	Nichols waves the man off.

				NICHOLS
		Not today, please.

	The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his 
	passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

				NICHOLS
		No. Not -

	... then stops - the face at his passenger window is 
	Richard Kimble's.

				NICHOLS
			(stunned)
		Oh, my God... Richard...

	Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

				KIMBLE
		How're you doing, Charlie?

				NICHOLS
		You're alive...

				KIMBLE
		Yeah. And I need your help.

				NICHOLS
		Anything.

				KIMBLE
		I need some money. Whatever you've 
		got on you.

				NICHOLS
		Of course.
	
	Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs 
	for his wallet...

				NICHOLS
		Tell me where you're staying. I'll 
		get you more money. Some clothes. 
		Just give me an address...

				KIMBLE
		I'll call you.

	Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks 
	back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the 
	corner and come up the street behind them.

	Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to 
	Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

				NICHOLS
		I know why you came back - to find 
		him. If I can help, call me... 
		Call me.

	They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they 
	don't see it.

				KIMBLE
		Thanks, Charlie...

				NICHOLS
		Here, Richard, take my coat...

	He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car 
	behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview 
	mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

				COP
			(to Nichols)
		Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.

	Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

	INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

	REWINDING. The media room - just what it sounds like -
	banks of audio/video equipment and a sound board.

	Renfro rewinds the tape. Gerard, Biggs, Poole and Newman.

				POOLE
		We've alerted St. Louis P.D

				GERARD
		Call them back. Tell them you've 
		made a mistake.

				POOLE
		What?

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		Stop it there.

	Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

				GERARD
		Drop the voices.

	Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the 
	BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC, 
	MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the 
	sounds now.

				GERARD
			(he's heard something)
		Listen.

				BIGGS
		Trains? Traffic?

				GERARD
		More... there's a voice in the 
		background.

	At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING 
	MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop 
	Merchandise Mart."

				RENFRO
		That's an El announcement.

				GERARD
		And there's no E1 in St. Louis. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble
		is in Chicago. Poole, get his 
		artwork out to local police and have 
		C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, 
		bring in the detectives that handled 
		his case.

	Instantly the room is in movement.

				STEVENS
		I'll prepare the press release.

				GERARD
		No.

	Stevens stops.

				GERARD
		They don't know he's alive and as 
		far as Kimble knows we don't either. 
		I want to keep it that way as long 
		as we can. Are we clear?

	The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to 
	Kimble.

				RENFRO
			(for the group)
		Perfectly.

	Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.

				GERARD
		Noah... go to my office and let's 
		officially take Dr. Kimble out of 
		purgatory.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Busy with doctors, orderlies and street people. Kimble moves 
	down hallway and enters.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

	He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks 
	around. SEE BACK INTO the office area of the clinic. It 
	could be any hospital clinic from this view.

	But as Kimble turns to leave we see a PATIENT waiting to be 
	called. On his lap we see a prosthetic arm. Kimble looks up 
	from the arm to the man.

	INT. KIMBLE'S OLD HOUSE - DAY

	Gerard walks through Kimble's house. The art and most of 
	the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping 
	bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces 
	of furniture.

	Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show 
	where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the 
	place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY

	Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning 
	supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation

	nightstand set up. She points to door leading up to the 
	street.

	CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE WOMAN'S BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Kimble also at work at the bedside table. He carefully cuts 
	out his do-it-yourself photograph and places it over the 
	existing photograph on the hospital I.D. The name on the 
	I.D. says: Desmondo Jose Ruiz. Then he places a thin piece 
	of lamination plastic and trims the edges.

	Kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look, then 
	examines the finished product not bad.

	WE PULL BACK to see: Gerard studying the photos. Renfro 
	looks up like someone's bitten him. He, Biggs and Gerard are 
	in Nichols' administrative office. Gleaming. Filled with 
	awards and photos of Nichols and influential people. Nichols
	hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat. He 
	shows no sign of nervousness.

				NICHOLS
		He stopped me in my car. I gave him 
		some money.

				GERARD
		Where was this?

				NICHOLS
		Outside our tennis -
			(correcting himself)
		 - my tennis club.

	Gerard moves around Nichols' office taking in the details.

				GERARD
		Did he ask you for help?

				NICHOLS
		I volunteered. He wouldn't accept 
		it.

				GERARD
		Why do you think he came back to 
		Chicago?

				NICHOLS
		He didn't tell me.

				GERARD
		I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure
		he was trying to protect you from 
		having to lie for him.

	Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, 
	books, drawings, awards and photos.

				GERARD
		If you're really his friend, you'll 
		help us bring him in unharmed.

				NICHOLS
		Why, so he can go back to prison? 
		If you want help, gentlemen, you've 
		come to the wrong man.

	Gerard finds a photo of Nichols and a gleaming Ferrari.

				GERARD
		Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. 
		Marshals' office closed out 11,003 
		warrants... 10,975 of those were 
		captured. The twenty-eight others 
		thought they were smarter than

	around a corner and Kimble stands less than ten feet from 
	a door that is marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

	He watches a technician leave the clinic and mops closer to 
	the doorway, and fails to see an attractive WOMAN DOCTOR 
	with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn 
	the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped 
	section.

	Head down, she is completely absorbed in a file and doesn't
	see the wet floor until she slips slightly, looks up but 
	keeps walking.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Where's Rudy?

				KIMBLE
		They said he's sick.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Didn't they tell you to put up the 
		sign?

				KIMBLE
		Uhhh. No they didn't.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Put up the 'wet floor' sign before 
		someone gets hurt.

	She keeps going.

				KIMBLE
			(mumbles)
		Asshole.

	She looks back at Kimble.

		Nothing.

	Anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall. He watches her

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab.

	He moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms, 
	hands, legs hanging from the ceiling. Cables and electronic 
	equipment are on the counters.

	He leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the 
	Prosthetic Clinic. He passes a computer room and finally 
	reaches the office. He is about to enter when a woman's 
	voice stops him.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Hey, Ricky... Weren't you just in 
		here?

	Kimble turns to see a PROSTHETIC TECHNICIAN. A large woman

		Naw... I'm going to be here all

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC OFFICE - LATER

	Kimble cleaning the blinds, keeps an eye on the Technician

	Opened.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Nimble looks over his shoulder. The Technician doesn't see 
	him.

	A Prosthetic Clinic Operations Manual is removed from shelf.

	Photographs of prosthetic arms. Kimble shifts the materials
	into his clothes, closes his coat and suddenly he stops.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - ANGLE ON ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Kimble waits for the elevator. The folders in his uniform 
	shift and he tries to rearrange them. When he turns back 
	we see Anne Eastman beside him. Her I.D. says: 
	"ANNE EASTMAN". She sees him doing the rearranging.

	The elevator arrives. They step into:

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Anne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side.

				ANNE (WOMAN DOCTOR)
		Hey, how're you doing?

				KIMBLE
		Fine.

				ANNE
		You find that sign?

				KIMBLE
		Yes, I did.

				ANNE
		You called me an asshole.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me. I was having a bad 
		shift.

	They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.

				ANNE
		You worked at other hospitals?

				KIMBLE
		Lots of them over the years. Here, 
		long ago. Hasn't changed much.

				ANNE
		I bet it hasn't. See you.

	They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops 
	and watches him leave.

	INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

	Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking 
	at his information.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

	Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets 
	of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over 
	Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, 
	making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
	attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
	for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

	Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
	on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
	covers his face.

	Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
	Prosthetic Clinic material.

	FLASHBACK - FIGHT

	Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's 
	sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

	FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

	Reacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind 
	returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

	FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

	Escaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the 
	STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again.

	Another DOOR SLAMS, but this time the sound is distinctly 
	different... a CAR DOOR.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM (BACK TO PRESENT)

	Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert. 
	Listening, he hears: FOOTSTEPS are real, just outside and 
	MOVING TOWARD him.

	HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

	A car door slams. We see unmarked police cars pulling up in 
	front of the apartment. Cops are moving toward the house.

	INT. BASEMENT - DAY

	Kimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window. 
	Carefully looks out:

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving 
	his way.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

	He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees 
	the back courtyard covered by more cops.

	Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
	he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

	He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of 
	charging through the basement door they move up the front 
	steps and into the house overhead.

	Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

	KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS

	Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He 
	runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, 
	actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and
	pulled away.

	KIMBLE

	Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the 
	Punk Kid out to the car.

	POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.

	Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car. His 
	grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble leans against the wall, exhausted.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble carries his cleaning tray down busy hallway just 
	outside of the Prosthetic Clinic and stops.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Two cops talk outside the Prosthetic Clinic.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble backs to a safe place in the trauma hallway to wait 
	for them to leave.

	CUT TO:

	INT. 11TH STREET POLICE DISTRICT HOUSE - DETECTIVES ROOM - NIGHT

	The Punk Kid is handcuffed to a bench as a cop works on a 
	report. Suddenly the Kid notices something that gets his 
	attention.

	KID'S POV

	A wanted poster of Kimble over the cop's head.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The Kid sees - Wanted for Murder - realizes who it is.

				PUNK KID
			(to cop)
		Hey. Hey! I know that guy!

	The cop looks up, sees Kimble's poster and then back at the 
	Kid.

	CUT TO:

	INT. TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic. In passing through 
	the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing. 
	A major accident has happened, victims are being brought in.

	The P.A. CALLS for doctors. STATIC.

	ANGLE ON FAR END OF TRAUMA HALLWAY

	Elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients. 
	Some walk, some are helped by family and police. Nurses 
	direct traffic.

	Orders fly. Medicines are called. Family members yell for 
	doctors. Ask for the injured. Anne picks up the pace with 
	an ORDERLY wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient, 
	a BOY.

				ANNE
		What happened?

				ORDERLY
		A bus flipped off the overpass. Got
		at least twenty more coming in.

				ANNE
		What about this one here?

				ORDERLY
		Fractured sternum. X-ray's coming 
		up.

	Anne checks the boy's chart.

				ANNE
		Okay, we've got to get some room
		in this hallway, people.

	Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out
	of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.

				ANNE
		Hey, take this one up the hall to
		Critical Care.

	Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

	Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the 
	hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays.

	Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble 
	pushing the gurney and looking at the film.

	ANNE

	Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a 
	better look, but Kimble is gone. She goes back to work.

	ON KIMBLE

	He wheels the Boy's gurney into an elevator. The doors 
	close.

	INT. HOSPITAL - O.R. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Kimble wheels the gurney down the hall and stops the Boy 
	on the scrub threshold to the O.R. and stops a SURGEON.

				KIMBLE
		Hey. Hey!

	A Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the 
	gurney.

				KIMBLE
		They just sent this one up.

	He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and 
	yells to O.R. nurse.

				SURGEON
		Bob! Get this one into room four, 
		stat.

	He looks up, Kimble is gone.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The 
	Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman,
	sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the 
	glass-walled computer room and closes the door.

	He closes the blinds and turns on the computer.

	CUT TO:

	INT. CRITICAL CARE UNIT - NIGHT

	The crisis has wound down. Anne moves into the room and 
	begins checking patients. She stops a unit nurse, GLADYS.

				ANNE
		Gladys, where's the boy I sent down 
		with the janitor?

				GLADYS
		What boy?

				ANNE
		The one with the fractured sternum.

				GLADYS
		He never came in here.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble scans DOS files, each an eight-letter enigma. Finds 
	one with promise and loads it up.

				KIMBLE
		Wrong...

	He backs up and tries another file.

	"CLIENT DEMOGRAPHIC ORGANIZER SEARCH BY: AGE, SEX, RACE, 
	LIMB, OR OTHER?"

	Kimble knows he's got it.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT

	INT. OPERATING ROOM WING - NIGHT

	Anne comes out of the stairwell and stops the Surgeon we 
	saw with Kimble.

				ANNE
		Dave, did you see a janitor come up 
		here earlier?

				SURGEON
		Yeah, he brought a kid up.
			(handing her the chart)
		Anne, did you write the orders? I 
		couldn't make out the signature...

				ANNE
		I saw -

				SURGEON
			(in a hurry now)
		Whoever did knew what the hell he 
		was doing. Kid's a hair away from 
		a ruptured aorta.

	He heads to the operating room, leaving her stunned. She 
	stares at the scrawled orders.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT

	A "PLEASE WAIT" message appears on the screen. We hear the 
	COMPUTER PROCESSING, searching, narrowing.

	The screen flashes:

	DO YOU WISH TO SUBDIVIDE?"

				KIMBLE
		Seventy-five. Hell, yes.

	Kimble types in another defining characteristic... 
	Residence: Illinois.

	Again he waits. Rattles the blinds to make it seem like he's 
	cleaning. The list shortens.

	"NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CANDIDATES: 21"

	continues to shake the blinds.

	EXT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC/TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble leaves Prosthetic Clinic and starts down the hall 
	for the exit when a voice stops him.

				ANNE (O.S.)
		Do you have a particular interest in

	Kimble turns to see Anne coming toward him.

				KIMBLE
		What do you mean?

				ANNE
		I saw you looking at that boy's

	She moves in on him. He eyes the exit.

				KIMBLE
		It's a hobby of mine -

				ANNE
		What other hobbies do you have? 
		Brain surgery?

				KIMBLE
	What do you want?

	She reaches him.

				ANNE
		I want to know how that kid ended 
		up in surgery.

				KIMBLE
		I'm a janitor. I did what I was 
		told.

				ANNE
		Bullshit. Who changed those orders?

	They hold a look. She knows. He takes a step back and she 
	pulls his I.D.

				ANNE
		You stand right here. I'm calling

	Kimble runs. Anne turns to call security but doesn't.

	She stares after Kimble.

		is pull his I.D.?

				ANNE
			(firmly)
		A little boy's alive today because 
		he did something.

	Gerard watches her eyes carefully.

				GERARD
		So, you weren't aware that when he 
		escaped he was being transported to 
		Menard State Prison to begin a term 
		of life imprisonment.

				ANNE
		For what?

				GERARD
		For murdering his wife.

	Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her 
	surprise.

				GERARD
		Thank you for your help, Doctor.

	He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's 
	gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that 
	place. Renfro and the other deputies converge.

				RENFRO
		What I can't figure is, if you were 
		Kimble, why'd you take a major 
		league chance of hanging around a 
		trauma ward?

	Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices 
	something.

				RENFRO
		The place would be crawling with cops.

	Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and 
	follows the Man down the hall.

	The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the 
	Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, 
	holds the hallway door open for Gerard.

				MAN
		Can I help you find something?

				GERARD
		Thank you, sir, I think you already 
		have.

	We see the Man has a prosthetic arm and that they are outside 
	the door marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

	Kimble feels the breath of a dozen COPS on his neck. And just 
	when his floor is mercifully about to arrive...

	Overhead lights flicker, and the elevator jars to a stop 
	between floors.

				COPS
		Aw, shit... Not now... Anybody

	Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims 
	shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.

	Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.

	One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the 
	shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the 
	stairwell railing to spy...

	Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be 
	any dark-haired man. But still...

				GERARD
		(a quick probe)
		Kimble.

	Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two 
	landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain 
	his step, keeps moving.

	But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's 
	stride told him everything.

	Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

	Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby.

	The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves
	toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak

	Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN

	People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors

	GERARD

	Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.

				GERARD
		Kimble. Stop!

	But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.

	KIMBLE

	Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the

	is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door 
	- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

	Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
	Gerard.

	Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - 
	but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,
	shoves a man out of his line of fire.

				GERARD

	With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the

	clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

		Kimble. Stop!

	It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his

	Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A

	bullet holes, he sees...

	Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
	alive. He runs free.

				GERARD
		Open the doors!

	Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the 
	glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. 
	It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble 
	rush across the street and disappear into the parade.

	Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.

	But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations

	shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
	parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
	across the seat and opens the door for him.

	He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, 
	he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a 
	handgun.

	Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.

	sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.

		Unless... What if you were a well

		Through a connection.

		Maybe through a company you did some

		Like a pharmaceutical company.

		On the night of his wife's murder,

	Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board.

		But Sykes claims he was out of town.

				POOLE
		And company records support that he 
		was on a business trip.

				RENFRO
		That's an easy fix. So let's say he 
		was in town. Did the job. Everything

	  			NEWMAN
		Instead of looking like a robbery 
		gone bad, Kimble ends up being the

		samples.

				GERARD
		Tissue samples?

	Gerard goes to his board. Renfro listens on the speakerphone.

				NEWMAN
		... From a drug study. And signed 
		for by Dr. Charles Nichols.

	Renfro and Gerard exchange a look.

				NEWMAN
		Nichols also knew Lentz. He was a 
		pathologist.

				RENFRO
		He was covering for Kimble.

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		Get CPD to bring in Sykes.

	Gerard stares at the board.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Kimble moves through steam tunnel beneath the hospital.

	It is lined with old furniture and supplies. A few moments 
	later we see Sykes following.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HILTON HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

	A cordial HOST steps up to the microphone. The room is 
	filled with doctors seated at tables around the room. It is 
	the end of a dinner symposium.

				HOST
		Tonight to close our conference, 
		we're honored to hear a report from 
		one of the most respected men in

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Kimble exits the hospital and moves toward Hospital E1 Station.

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	As the Host continues his introduction of the keynote speaker 
	we PAN the DAIS of distinguished medical men and women...

				HOST
		... He is the A. Jude Robinson 
		Fellow and Administrative Chief of 
		Pathology at Chicago Memorial 
		Hospital... and just recently has 
		been appointed member of the board 
		of directors for Devlin-Macgregor 
		Pharmaceuticals. Please welcome...

	... and STOP ON Charles Nichols.

				HOST
		... Dr. Charles Nichols.

	Nichols rises to applause and moves to the podium.

	EXT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL EL STATION - NIGHT

	Kimble starts up the stairs to the station just as a train 
	is coming in. Kimble moves down the platform and boards the 
	downtown train. Just before the doors close Sykes steps onto 
	the last car. The train moves out.

	CUT TO:

	INT. GERARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Gerard stares at his board. Stevens comes to the door.

				STEVENS
		I checked Sykes' calls for the last 
		two years against Kimble's like you 
		asked and found nothing.

				GERARD
		All right. It was a thought.

	He goes back to the board but Stevens isn't finished.

				STEVENS
		But when I cross-checked Kimble's 
		phone records... one came up.

	Gerard looks up.

				GERARD
		Kimble called Sykes.
			(calling)
		Renfro! Get C.P.D. to bring in Sykes!

				STEVENS
		Night of his wife's murder - 
		seven-thirty in the evening from 
		his car.

	Gerard stares at the deputy, thinking - something doesn't 
	click. Stevens sees the empty stare, then Gerard looks 
	back at his board.

				STEVENS
		I have the phone record right here.

				GERARD
			(calling)
		Poole! Bring me Kimble's arrest 
		report, now.
			(to Stevens)
		No, Stevens... I believe you.

	Poole enters with Kimble's arrest transcript. Gerard takes 
	the transcript as Renfro appears at the door.

				POOLE
		Sam, C.P.D. just checked Sykes' 
		apartment. He's not there.

	As Gerard looks up, we -

	CUT TO:

	INT. DOWNTOWN EL TRAIN - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

	Sits in the front car. There are very few other riders.

	A man with newspaper sits across the car reading. The 
	headlines facing Kimble say: "KIMBLE IN CHICAGO". Kimble's 
	booking photo stares back at him.

	Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns 
	the pages.

	The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back 
	to reading. A moment later he folds the paper back to the 
	front page.

	The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again,
	then down.

	Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, 
	stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the 
	rear cars.

	Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his 
	car to reach the station. He keeps his head turned until 
	the man is gone.

	ANGLE - THROUGH CENTER OF TRAIN - NIGHT

	From the center of Kimble's car we see the man with the 
	newspaper move up to a TRANSIT COP. They begin talking.

	Kimble stands, coming INTO the SHOT. We see him watching 
	the discussion.

	Suddenly a man, sitting in the rear of the car, stands 
	and blocks Kimble's view of the Cop. It's Sykes. His gun 
	is drawn.

				SYKES
		Back up. Move to the door, Doc.

	CUT TO:

	INT. TRAIN - TRANSIT COP'S CAR - NIGHT

	Transit Cop moves past the man with the newspaper toward 
	Kimble's car.

				TRANSIT COP
			(to radio)
		This is transit unit, 23. I have a 
		possible sighting of Richard Kimble. 
		Northbound coming into the Balbo 
		station. Request immediate back-up 
		at the station.

	He moves toward the connecting door to Kimble's car.

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	The train is not yet to the station. He has no escape. 
	Sykes moves toward him.

				SYKES
		This is my stop, Doc.

	Kimble stares hard at Sykes. He steps toward the side 
	exit.

				KIMBLE
		Good, it's my stop, too.

	Suddenly the door behind Sykes opens and the Transit Cop 
	enters.

				TRANSIT COP
		Kimble.
			(to Sykes)
		Sir, move away from him.

	Sykes - the gun tucked next to his side - turns.

	The Cop sees Sykes' gun, reacts...

	But Sykes FIRES first, shoots the cop FOUR TIMES.

	As the Cop falls, Sykes turns quickly to finish Kimble. 
	But Kimble pulls the emergency brake over the door.

	EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	The brakes lock. The TRAIN SCREECHES.

	INT. REAR CARS - NIGHT

	Passengers are thrown off their feet. Bags and briefcases 
	go flying.

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Sykes is thrown forward toward Kimble who holds onto a bar 
	for balance.

	EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	The train stops just short of the station. Only the first 
	two windows of the front car are over the platform.

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp. 
	Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble 
	in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on 
	throughout the car.

	Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and 
	aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and 
	almost smiles.

	SYKES
	Go ahead. You don't have it in you .

	For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the 
	gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. 
	Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, 
	driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost 
	unconscious.

	Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit 
	Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.

	Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the 
	Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the 
	Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop.

	He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face 
	off the floor.

				KIMBLE
		Not as easy as Helen, was it?
			(slams Sykes' head down, leaves)
		You missed your stop.

	He moves to the front of the car with Sykes' and the Transit 
	Cop's guns out. People back out of his way. He moves to 
	where the first two windows extend over the platform, kicks 
	out the front window and...

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

	... drops to the station platform. Kimble lowers his head and 
	moves down the uncrowded platform to the station.

	INT. GERARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The report comes off the scanner.

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		... units in the vicinity of Balbo

		Balbo station. That's -

				GERARD

		Poole, get Biggs and Newman.

	They're gone as we -

	CUT TO:

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	Police cruisers pull outside the station.

	INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	As transit police move up the escalator to the platform, 
	Kimble moves unnoticed through the underground mall 
	beneath the hotel. Deposits the guns into a mail box and 
	keeps moving.

	INT. GERARD'S CAR - NIGHT

	Renfro driving, Gerard and Pool in car. Report comes over 
	the radio.

				POLICE DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		... all units in vicinity of Balbo 
		E1. Officer down. Repeat, officer 
		down. Man leaving scene with two

	Gerard looks out the window, he knows what this means.

				GERARD
			(quietly to himself)
		Damn...

	INT. HOTEL - MALL LEVEL / LOBBY - NIGHT

	Kimble moves up escalators from the underground station 
	into the Hilton.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Disheveled and driven, he moves from the escalators to the 
	lobby - checks the list of hospitality suites and sees 
	board which indicates Nichols speech in the rooftop 
	ballroom. He moves on to the main elevators.

	CUT TO:

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Nichols speaking. As he talks we MOVE TO...

	ANGLE ON TABLE OF MEN

	Listening - the same men we saw in the hospitality suite 
	when Nichols talked to Kimble. As we MOVE TIGHTER ON one 
	of the men, we notice his name tag says: Board of 
	Directors... Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

	INT. HILTON ROOFTOP ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Kimble rides alone to the rooftop ballroom.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	Gerard's car pulls up in front of the hotel. Police are 
	controlling pedestrians. Newman and Biggs, already decked 
	out in Kevlar, meet him.

				NEWMAN
		C.P.D. just reported -

				GERARD
		I heard. Was it Kimble?

				BIGGS
		Conflicting reports, but the cops 
		are considering him a shooter.

	Heavily-armed CPD units pull up. Gerard stares at the police 
	presence. He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is 
	conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain.

				POLICE CAPTAIN
		Witnesses say he entered hotel from 
		the subway.

				KELLY
		Okay. I want it locked down. Start 
		on the lower levels.

	The captain moves off. Gerard intercepts the cop.

				GERARD
		That's my man in there, Kelly.

				KELLY
		Not since he took down one of ours, 
		Gerard. This is a police matter,
		now. Stay, the hell, out of it.

	Kelly moves off. Gerard watches him a moment then he looks 
	up to the roof. Newman hands Gerard his belt with his 
	backup piece.

				GERARD
		C'mon, I know where he's going.

	He moves into the hotel with his deputies.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	LOCKDOWN MONTAGE - EXT. / INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	A) C.P.D. cruisers arriving. Cops deploying to points of

	Meigs Field downtown and heads for the hotel.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ROOFTOP ELEVATORS/PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble exits the elevators and moves down the corridor to 
	the ballroom. A man tries to stop him at the doors, Kimble 
	simply moves him out of the way and opens the doors to:

	CUT TO:

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Nichols moves to the last of his speech as Kimble enters 
	at the rear

				NICHOLS
		... And I especially would like to 
		thank my researchers who helped me...

	Nichols stops his speech - stunned to see Kimble.

				NICHOLS
		Richard...

				KIMBLE
		What's wrong, Charlie? Surprised?

	Kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of 
	doctors toward the podium.

	We see the faces of Kimble's colleagues and friends from 
	the ballroom sequence earlier. At first no one notices 
	Kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais, the 
	applause fades and then room quiets. Whispers of:

				CROWD
		It's Richard. It's Kimble.

	Stunned expressions.

	Kimble continues to the front, talking to Nichols as if 
	the room were empty.

				KIMBLE
		After Lentz died, you were the only 
		one that had access to the 
		pathology reports.

	Nichols remains calm.

				NICHOLS
		Reports? What are you?

				KIMBLE
		You switched the samples and 
		falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 
		could get approval.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I don't know what you're 
		talking about?...

				KIMBLE
		I have a set of the original 
		samples.

	Nichols stares at Kimble and for the first time we see a 
	flicker of concern.

				KIMBLE
		You almost pulled it off, Charlie. 
		But I know all about it now, and I 
		can prove it.

	Nichols and Kimble hold a look. Nichols turns to the audience.

				KIMBLE
		Ladies and gentlemen. My friend, as 
		you can see, is obviously not well. 
		Richard, if you want to talk -

				KIMBLE
		I didn't come here to talk

	Nichols leaves the dais and heads toward the exit.

	Kimble tracks along with him - moving through the tables - 
	passing the table with the Devlin-MacGregor board of 
	directors. They are disturbed by this situation.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moves through a door and exits into...

	HALLWAY

	Kimble follows moving through the tables and people to 
	reach the door.

	As soon as he's gone there are calls for "security." Doctors 
	move for the exits.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Gerard, Renfro, Newman, Biggs and Poole move into the lobby.
	Police move to cover the lower floors.

				BIGGS
		C.P.D. has the perimeter, hotel 
		security has the parking structure.

				GERARD
		Let them keep busy down below. 
		Newman, get with security. See if 
		you can locate Kimble from the

	Newman branches off to Hotel Security. The rest follow 
	Gerard to the rooftop elevators.

	EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARING over Chicago skyline. The bright red sign of the 
	Hilton Hotel looms ahead.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

	Nichols moves down hallway and turns into a hospitality 
	suite. A moment later Kimble follow and enters the...

	HOSPITALITY SUITE

	... and is immediately smashed with a chair by Nichols. 
	Kimble goes flying, stunned. Nichols locks the door.

				NICHOLS
		Your best quality, Richard, is that 
		you don't give up -

	Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet.

				NICHOLS
		... even when it's clearly in your 
		best interest to...

	He hits him again, drives him back into the library.

	Kimble tries to recover as Nichols relentlessly stays on 
	him. He pulls him up, slams him against the fire escape 
	doors.

				NICHOLS
		I always knew that I'd have to kill 
		you.

	He drives a blow into Kimble's stomach.

				NICHOLS
		Now, I must thank you for giving me 
		200 witnesses tonight who will 
		support me... when I tell them it 
		was self-defense...

	He shoves Kimble through the door out into...

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE BALCONY - NIGHT

	... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to 
	keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him, 
	but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks 
	Nichols back against the other side of fire escape.

				KIMBLE
		You missed your chance, Charlie...

	Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with 
	two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.

	Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a 
	security camera.

	CUT TO:

	INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

	A room lined with security monitors. Two security personnel 
	sit in front of their console. Newman stands behind them.

	On screen: We see Kimble moving down the stairs toward 
	Nichols, who pulls himself to his feet.

	Newman stands in front of the screen, talks to his radio.

				GERARD
		I want them covered.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the 
	blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another 
	set of stairs to the roof.

				KIMBLE
		You took everything away from me... 
		for money.

	INT. BALLROOM ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor. The 
	elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented 
	doctors trying to escape. The marshals wade through, meet 
	up with two hotel security guards.

				GERARD
		This way.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by 
	the lights of the city skyline.

				KIMBLE
		I want to know, Charlie... was it 
		worth it...?

				NICHOLS
		This thing is bigger than even you 
		think, Richard. You can't stop it.

	He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him 
	against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the 
	street appears far below.

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom. 
	The deputies move to separate areas. Several doctors point 
	them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled.

	Newman stands in front the security monitors and watches 
	Kimble and Nichols on the roof.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the 
	HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits 
	the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter:

				VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.)
		Chicago police. Freeze.

	In the instant of shock, Nichols knees Kimble and bolts.

	INTERCUT:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

		Clear the hallway.
			(to security)
		Get that door open.

	The door opens and Gerard moves quickly through the 
	hospitality suite for the rooftop.

				GERARD
			(to security)
		Stay at this door.

	He moves through the door to the roof alone.

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman watching the security monitors sees Kimble and 
	Nichols. On another monitor we see Gerard exit the suite.

	EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

	Nichols runs.

	Kimble recovers, sees Gerard moving down the fire escape 
	toward him, and Nichols escaping. He goes after Nichols.

	The helicopter circles back over the roof, illuminating the 
	rooftop in its million-candle-power beam.

				HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)

	The helicopter swings out to keep Kimble in sight.

	Gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows.

				GERARD

		This is a United States Marshal. 
		Get that helicopter out of here!

	Kimble is gaining ground on Nichols.

	Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams 
	him down hard again.

	HELICOPTER

	Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and 
	Gerard closing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	The elevator doors close and the car beneath the

	Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass 
	and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble 
	and Nichols into...

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft 
	and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. 
	Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble 
	hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping 
	himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An 
	elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness.

	giant machines.

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
	carefully into the laundry.

	... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
	DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
	move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
	heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

	... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
	stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by 
	conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

	The NOISE is DEAFENING.

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	NEWMAN IN SECURITY

	Newman checks the computer board for the elevator 
	position.

				NEWMAN

		Level five.

	INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
	exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
	grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

	KIMBLE

	Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
	stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
	the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
	between the large conveyors.

	ANGLE - SORTING ROOM

	Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
	standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

				GERARD
		Get out of here.

	He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
	worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
	rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
	switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
	takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
	main room.

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		We're going in. Give me five 
		minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.

	He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main 
	room.

	INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

	He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

	He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
	dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
	him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

	Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
	voice from the other end of the laundry.

				GERARD (V.O.)
			(above the din)
		Kimble!

	Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
	where Gerard enters.

	ON GERARD

	The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

	They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
	up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
	move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
	equipment.

				GERARD
		... There is no way out of here.

	The building is locked down.

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
	the conveyor belts.

				GERARD (O.S.)
		Kimble... I know about Nichols. I 
		know about Sykes. Kimble stops.

	ON GERARD

				GERARD
		... Nichols borrowed your car the 
		night of the murder and called 
		Sykes from it.

	RENFRO

	Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
	comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
	dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

	KIMBLE

	Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
	Nichols.

	GERARD

	Moving through the forest of massive bags.

				GERARD
		... That's why there was no forced 
		entry at your house. He'd used your 
		keys.

	KIMBLE 

	Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

	NICHOLS

	Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
	killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
	chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
	hanging control for the I-beam.

	GERARD

	Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
	dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
	see straight back toward the washers. 

				GERARD
		Kimble... Come meet me out here.

	ON RENFRO

	He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
	under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
	WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
	rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
	opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

	NICHOLS

	Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
	shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
	Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

	GERARD

	Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor 
	belts. He makes one last appeal.

				GERARD
		It's time to quit running... if you 
		don't, you know I'll stop you. He 
		listens, there is no answer.

	KIMBLE

	Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
	shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

	GERARD

	Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
	pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
	on us...

	NICHOLS

	Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
	before he fires however he hears...

				KIMBLE (O.S.)
		Hey, Chuckles...

	Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
	and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
	behind Gerard.

	GERARD

	Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
	with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
	instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

	Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

	They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
	room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

	INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

	Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan 
	Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie 
	for space in front of the Hilton Towers.

	Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an 
	ambulance. The doors close.

	REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk 
	giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom. 
	We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them 
	TOWARD the entrance.

				T.V. NEWS REPORTER
		... As we reported a few minutes 
		ago, the saga of once-prominent 
		Chicago surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble, 
		who escaped from an Illinois 
		Corrections bus, took a strange
		twist this evening when Dr. Kimble 
		was captured at the Chicago Hilton...

	ANOTHER REPORTER continues:

				ANOTHER REPORTER
		... there are unconfirmed reports 
		from police of new evidence which 
		may exonerate Kimble while 
		implicating some of the biggest 
		names in medicine...

	The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of 
	photographs.

	A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the 
	ballroom:

				STUNNED DOCTOR
		He just walked in... We didn't know 
		what he was going to do. My wife 
		was very frightened... The next 
		thing I knew cops were charging in 
		and...

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole 
	and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos. 
	Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics.

	EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT

	As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights 
	flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd 
	forward, yelling questions.

				REPORTER
		Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove 
		your innocence!

	Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

				GERARD
			(to police)
		Get them back.

	The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into 
	a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back 
	door and helps Kimble inside.

				BIGGS
		Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.

	Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next 
	to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

				GERARD
			(to Poole)
		Poole, you got that thing?
			(to Kimble)
		Give me your hands.

	Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks 
	Kimble's handcuffs.

	Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the 
	pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

				GERARD
		Take care of those hands, Doc, 
		you're going to need them again 
		soon.

				KIMBLE
		I thought you told me 'you didn't 
		care.'

				GERARD
		Yeah, well, don't spread it around.

	They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

	HELICOPTER POV

	The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading 
	back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at 
	first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined 
	by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the 
	traffic, movement and lights of the city.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT

	CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

	Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

	EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT

	Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN 
	in tuxedo moves into:

	INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

	THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
	to the ballroom.

	ANGLE - COAT CHECK

	The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
	When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
	a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

	He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
	ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
	fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
	sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
	models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

	A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
	AID FOUNDATION"

	Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
	sets on another waiter's passing tray.

				ROBERTS (V.O.)
		Richard...

	DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
	of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

				ROBERTS
		Cancun. Nat just talked everybody 
		into it...

	A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

				KIMBLE 
		So, what's the deal? If the hospital 
		buys ten new -

				NAT
		No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
		Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
		has no ulterior motives.

				KIMBLE 
		On the house, huh?
			(to bartender)
		Tonic water with lime.

	Everyone agrees.

				KIMBLE 
		Never get me to sell my soul for one
		of those trips...

	His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

				KIMBLE
			(to Nat)
	 	... But if you get any more Bulls 
		tickets, Nat, give me a call.

	The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS

	Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary

	He keeps moving.

				GOLFING MAN 
		Thanks, Richard...

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT

	KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
	elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
	T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

				DR. WAHLUND 
			(dripping sarcasm)
		I'm so glad you talked me into 
		coming, Richard... I can pick my
		cruise wardrobe.

				RICHARD 
		It's for a good cause, Kath... 
		Besides you need to get out of the
		lab more. Your electron microscope
		is starting to give you a tan.

	She smiles. He moves on.

	ANGLE - PARTY

	Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

				KIMBLE
		Hey, Jim.

	DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
	University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I just saw someone who 
		wanted to meet you...

	Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
	wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
	a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
	catch a look and hold it.

				NICHOLS (V.O.)
		Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
		is working on the RDU90 trials for 
		Devlin-Macgregor.

	Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
	smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

				LENTZ
		Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
		trading phone calls last few days 
		... something about a biopsy report 
		I returned to you?

				KIMBLE
			(suddenly attentive)
		Yeah... Three. Livers appeared 
		hepatetic to me.

				LENTZ
		I'll be in my office in the morning 
		and I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
		a good time for you?

				KIMBLE
		Sure.

				LENTZ
			(holds Kimble's look, 
			then to Nichols)
		See you, Jim.

	Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
	on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
	Nichols move together through the party.

				NICHOLS
			(digs in his pocket)
		Before I forget, I went by the garage
		this afternoon and picket up the 
		Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

	He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

				KIMBLE
		They fix it this time?

				NICHOLS
		We'll see.

	They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
	Kimble kisses her.

				NICHOLS
		You look fabulous, Helen.

	He kisses Helen.

				HELEN (WOMAN)
		Hello, Jim.

				NICHOLS
			(to Kimble)
		We've got a court tomorrow at three.

	Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

				KIMBLE
		Well, I've seen everyone, can we 
		leave?

				HELEN
		That would be a little abrupt, don't 
		you think?

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT

	A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
	others at table ant sit across from each other.

	Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
	mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
	OLDER WIFE.

	Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
	her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
	CONTINUE...

	INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
	changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
	of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
	catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
	his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
	ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
	of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
	"not yet."

	As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

	"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
	at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
	"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
	you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
	'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

	Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
	watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
	her head.

				NOW EAU WIFE
			(to table)
		I told my husband that he was going 
		to kill us if he didn't stop 
		operating. What with this AIDS thing, 
		he's putting us all at risk.

	Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
	a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

				HELEN
			(to her dinner partners)
		I'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
		home.

	They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
	shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we 
	see Lentz watching.

	INT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
	his hair as he drives.

				HELEN
		You looked handsome tonight...

				KIMBLE
		Thank you...

	He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
	for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

				HELEN
		Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
		like waiters...

				KIMBLE
		But me?

				HELEN
		You looked more like... a band 
		director.

	He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
	changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

				HELEN
		Are we home yet?...

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his 
	PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.

				KIMBLE
			(to phone)
		Dr. Kimble
			(suddenly attentive)
		When? Okay, tell them I'll be there 
		in ten minutes.

	He hangs up.

				KIMBLE
		Tim's got a problem.

	Helen kisses him again, opens the door.

				HELEN
		Call me on your way home.

	CREDITS END as we -

	CUT TO:

	INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down 
	stairs to the OR hall.

	He sticks his head into the operating room.

				KIMBLE
		Cavalry's here.

	Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

	SCRUB ROOM

	Kimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring 
	him up to speed.

				RESIDENT
		Patient is a male, forty-three. We 
		pulled his gall bladder and the 
		bleeding started.

				KIMBLE
		What's his pro time?

				RESIDENT
			(concerned)
		He's at 36 seconds. We got a major 
		bleeder in here.

				KIMBLE
		You talk to the family?

				RESIDENT
		None. He's off the street.

	CUT TO:


	INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

	Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with 
	trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble 
	is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both 
	working so intently they never look at each other as they 
	talk...

				KIMBLE
			(to Anesthesiologist)
		Okay... I'm clamping. Can he 
		tolerate it?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		He's a very sick guy.

				KIMBLE
		Do we have a choice?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		Go for it.

				KIMBLE
		Marie, give me a clamp...

	MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble 
	and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident 
	assisting.

				KIMBLE
			(never looking up)
		Your husband know you're here tonight,
		Marie?... What about this liver?

				RESIDENT
		History's sketchy. Could be an 
		alcoholic.

				KIMBLE
		Who referred him?

				RESIDENT
		He's on a drug protocol. RDU90.

	Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident 
	over their masks, then back to work.

				KIMBLE
		The wave of the future... Marie, you 
		told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous 
		of this late night thing we've got 
		going here... This should hold him. 
		Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a 
		biopsy...
			(to circulating nurse)
		Send it downstairs and make sure you 
		get Kath her slice.

				SURGEON
		You staying for the closing, Rich?

	Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

				KIMBLE
		No. I got a date.

	INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind 
	him; it is the other Surgeon.

				SURGEON
		Hey, Richard...

	Kimble turns.

				SURGEON
		Thanks.

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Kimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home. 
	He is on phone, waits for answer.

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with 
	an afghan around her shoulders. She's been reading.

		I'm glad it went well. I'll see you

	Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the 
	stairs.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

	Kimble driving.

	INT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

	Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

	Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on 
	the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close 
	one of the interior closet doors.

	She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

	A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
	claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her 
	string of pearls bursts...

	... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls 
	across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from 
	the top.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the 
	driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still 
	on.

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on 
	the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and 
	calls up the stairs.

				KIMBLE
		I'm home. Did you hear who won the 
		Bulls game?

	No answer. He steps into the:

	KITCHEN

	The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The 
	WASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer,
	and STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two 
	glassesand leaves the kitchen.

	INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT

	Lies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of 
	phone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the 
	gun.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS - STAIRS - NIGHT

	Kimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Helen's hand reaches out presses the cradle down, dials

	ON KIMBLE

	Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops.

	A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks 
	it up... a pearl.

				KIMBLE
		Helen?

	Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. 
	Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

	UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

	Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
	he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
	Adrenal surge.

	Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
	free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
	The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
	leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
	sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
	landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
	hall below.

	SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

	The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
	catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
	shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

	Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
	Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
	face...

	The SIRENS are LOUDER...

	Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
	down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

	Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped 
	by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

				HELEN (O.S.)
		He's here... still in the house...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one 
	hand, her head with the other.

		Did I hear you right? Your attacker 
		is still in the house? Ma'am?

				HELEN
		He's trying to kill me...

	Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.

	Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she 
	was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her 
	leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

				KIMBLE
		Hang on, babe... going to be all 
		right.

	Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

				HELEN
		My head. Richard my hold me.

	Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her 
	head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes 
	she won't be all right.

	CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

	The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious 
	neighbors, television news vans, etc.

	Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van 
	arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.

				DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
		Can you give us a little more to go

		it, Doc?

	INT. 11TH STREET DISTRICT HOUSE - NIGHT

	CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" 
	shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: 
	KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, 
	aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

				KIMBLE
		It was .38... I think. I only saw it 
		for a second. I knocked it out of 
		his hand.

	As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the

	Kimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems 
	to sense something aggressive in their questioning.

	They no longer seem on the same team.

				KIMBLE
		What's going on here? This guy was 
		trying to rob us.

	The two cops stare at Kimble.

				KIMBLE
		You guys have got to be out of your

	out at the yard. Another attorney, RANDOLPH, watches 
	Gutherie.

				GUTHERIE
		... We can't find this guy.

				KIMBLE
		I know what I saw, Walter.

				GUTHERIE
		I put you up on the stand to say what 
		you saw without anything that 
		remotely smells like proof and the 
		State's attorney is going to take 
		this one-armed man story and run it 
		up our ass.
			(he holds Kimble's look)
		Look, Richard, you're paying us a 
		lot of money to defend you... A plea
		to second degree -

				KIMBLE
		I didn't kill my wife.

	INT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - DAY

	Kimble being escorted back to the courtroom. A guard carries 
	his suit in a bag. He is taunted by other prisoners.

				GUTHERIE (V.O.)
		You're a successful upper middle 
		class white man charged in a 
		violent crime...

	INT. COOK COUNTY LOCKUP / CHANGE ROOM - DAY

	On the other side of the door is the courtroom. A sheriff's 
	deputy hands Kimble (now wearing his suit), a small plastic 
	bag. In it we see his wedding band.

				GUTHERIE (V.O.)
		It's a circumstantial case, but it's 
		also a jury trial. We play 'em, they 
		play 'em...

	INT. CHICAGO COURTROOM - DAY

	Richard Kimble sits at defense table... watches prosecutors 
	chat with Helen's relatives. Media anchors glare at him.

				GUTHERIE (V.O.)
		... But if we lose, we lose big. 
		Just remember, they're lined up a 
		block long to have your hide.

	HARD CUT TO:

	PHOTOGRAPH OF HELEN KIMBLE'S BODY

	A crime scene photograph.

	DETECTIVE KELLY

	On the stand.

				DETECTIVE KELLY
		No forcible entry was found. From 
		the beginning of the investigation, 
		it did not appear to be a break-in. 
		Nothing was missing.

	FORENSICS TECHNICIAN

	On the stand.

				FORENSICS TECHNICIAN
		The defendant's prints were found on
		the neck, gun, bullets, and lamp... 
		no other sets were fount other than 
		the deceased.

	FACES OF THE JURY

	Impassive. Attentive. His "peers." They listen to the 
	recording of the 911 tape.

				911 (V.O.)
		Did I hear you right? Your attacker 
		is still in the house? Ma'am?

				HELEN (V.O.)
		He's trving to kill me...

				911 (V.O.)
		Will you repeat that please?

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Richard... He's trying to kill me...

	KIBLE'S POV - THE JURY

	A few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken 
	out of context.

	NICHOLS ON THE STAND

				PROSECUTOR
		Dr. Nichols. You are aware that 
		Richard Kimble was the only 
		beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate.
		12 million dollars roughly.

				NICHOLS
		I was aware of that. The money meant 
		nothing to him.

				PROSECUTOR
		Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
		once said that 'if he had Helen's 
		money he could find plenty of uses.'
		Did he not?

				NICHOLS
		We were talking about -

				PROSECUTOR
		Yes or no?

	Nichols' look tells us everything... Yes.

	CUT TO:

	CORONER

	On the stand.

				CORONER
		The wound to the head caused a 
		massive hemorrhage to the brain. It 
		took from five to seven minutes for 
		her to die...

	A woman in the jury reacts. Kimble notices.

	KIMBLE

	On the stand. He finishes his moving description of the 
	events. We see some of the jury has been moved.

				KIMBLE
		... And I was holding her when the 
		officers came in.

	Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the 
	jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

				PROSECUTOR
		How tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?

				KIMBLE
		I can't be sure. We were, mostly on 
		the floor, fighting... I couldn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Did that fight cause the scratches 
		on your face and arms?

				KIMBLE
		No. As I explained -

				PROSECUTOR
		And how did this man enter your 
		house?

				KIMBLE
		I don't know -

				PROSECUTOR
		And you probably don't know why your 
		wife told the emergency operator You 
		were her attacker?

				KIMBLE
		She didn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Your name is Richard, isn't it? Your 
		gun is a .38, isn't it? Your prints 
		were on the gun, the bullets, the 
		lamp, her neck, weren't they?

				KIMBLE
		Look...

				PROSECUTOR
		Weren't they?

	CUT TO:

	INT. COURTROOM - DAY

	Richard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a 
	shadow of the man we knew before, stares ahead passively as 
	Judge Bennett delivers the sentencing to hushed courtroom.

				JUDGE BENNETT
		After careful and studied review of 
		all evidence presented during each 
		phase of this proceeding, and 
		because aggravated circumstances, 
		detailed at length, were present 
		the night of January 20th.

	Kimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence 
	shockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear 
	doors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's 
	satisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, 
	lowers his head. Disbelief.

	ANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE

	He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by 
	bailiff. Gutherie whispers an "I'm sorry." Kimble doesn't 
	hear it.

				JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
		Therefore, it is the decision of 
		this court...

	Looks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom. Faces 
	stare back.

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIT ROOM - DAY

	Judge Bennett's V.O. CONTINUES over:

	A locker opening. Inside, a profusion of chrome and nickel 
	plating. Jailhouse jewelry. Handcuffs dragged out. Action 
	checked.

				JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
		... that you be remanded to Menard 
		State penitentiary...

	CLOSE ON CUFFS

	Slapped down over wrists, ratcheting down tight.

	Ankle cuffs dragged out. Pant legs raised, canvas shoes 
	exposed. Cuffs clamped down on ankles.

	CHAINS RATTLED out. Snaked across the floor. Looped around 
	waists and locked to handcuffs to form belly chains.

				JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
		... where you will serve a sentence 
		of life imprisonment without 
		possibility of parole.

	EXT . SALLY PORT (COOK COW TY JAIL) - NIGHT

	The chain gang exits through the sally port. Kimble and 
	three other prisoners. Jailers escort them to...

	An Illinois Department of Corrections guard moves alongside,
	checking the undercarriage with a pole-mounted mirror.

	The GAVEL CRACKS as we -

	CUT TO:

	INT. BUS - CLOSE ON KEY - DAY

	Locking wire mesh cage inside bus.

	An old DIESEL COUGHS to life.

	EXT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

	Main gates open. The BUS GRINDS onto the streets.

	INT. BUS - DAY

	The four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer 
	chained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing...

	The two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG 
	GUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns 
	bouncing on their knees. Prisoner #l shifts his gaze to...

	The driver. Pistol on his hip.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging:

				PRISONER #1
		Hey. Illinois penal regulations 
		require a meal for transport
		rides of four hours or more.

	Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
	Checks his watch: 4:00.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Jack! Feedin' time.

	Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
	belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

	PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
	the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
	aisle...

	PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
	between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
	CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
	plastic shank.

	Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
	handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
	a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

				COPELAND
		Breathe, and you're first.

	Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
	carelessly ready.

	Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
	doesn't respond.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Suit yourself.

	He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
	sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

	Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

				KIMBLE
		Look out!

	Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
	Young Guard's gut.

	Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
	out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

	Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
	floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
	inside, but...

	Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
	Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under
	the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

	The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard.

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	As the bus careens off the road, accelerating.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing
	prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard.

	Old Guard shotgun-butts Prisoner #1, flips the gun, PUMPS 
	ONE ROUND into the man's chest. Dead. He turns just as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat.

	Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the 
	Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes 
	off target as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
	and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the 
	bottom of a small ravine.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

	On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
	him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
	at...

	Kimble. Rising between the seats.

	A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
	off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

	Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
	find Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
			(to Kimble)
		You. You're a doctor. C'mere.

	He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
	medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

				OLD GUARD
		Do something.

	Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
	his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
	Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
	Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

				KIMBLE
		He isn't going to make it unless he 
		gets to a hospital. Fast.

				OLD GUARD
		ZL.

	In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it 
	just settling?

	With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
	Guard's bleeding.

	ANGLE UNDER SEAT

	We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
	back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the 
	opening.

	BACK TO KIMBLE

	A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
	retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
	growing vibration.

				KIMBLE
		Just where the hell are we?

	The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
	looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

				OLD GUARD
		Oh, shit...


	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
	grows bright by the light of an approaching train.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges 
	to his side.

				KIMBLE
		It's locked. Where're your keys?

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young 
	Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles 
	the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

	The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
	snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

				KIMBLE
		Which one? This? This one?!

	Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
	the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

				KIMBLE
		Help me get him -

	But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out 
	the shattered windshield.

	ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS

	Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...

	EXT. BUS - NIGHT

	... and hits the ground running the other way. The 
	locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should 
	Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard 
	hold a look.

	EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT

	As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard 
	behind him. He slings the man clear.

	SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

	For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

	The train light X-rays him.

	Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
	away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
	dozen mincing steps before...

	IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
	splitting it open.

	Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
	feet, still running feverish half-steps.

	An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
	flanks.

	The train burns past the wounded Guard.

	Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
	him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

	Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
	after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
	chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

	The train burrows to a stop.

	Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
	of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
	nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
	something in his hand.

	It's the key-ring.

	EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. 
	Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		Give me that.

	Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
	own chains.

				COPELAND
		You listen to me. I don't give a 
		damn which way you go, just don't 
		follow me.

	Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his 
	arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the 
	other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT

	News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing 
	smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines 
	hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work 
	feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled 
	wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation 
	investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted 
	remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

	Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. 
	marshals emerge:

	BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick 
	shithouse.

	RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds 
	fully-equipped.

	POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during 
	nut-cuttin' time.

	NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

	From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media 
	spectacle.

				GERARD
		Good lord...

				REFRO
		What is this... a circus?

	As a group they begin moving along the service road above 
	the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below 
	them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they 
	walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

	Biggs spots something...

				BIGGS
		Point of impact.

	... and branches off.

				GERARD
		Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.

				BIGGS
		Shit.
			(to Newman)
		Come on.

	They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain 
	with Gerard.

	A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he
	sees Gerard's Marshall star.

				GERARD
		How ya doing? Who's in charge?

				TROOPER
		Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the 
		lights -

	Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the 
	scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

	Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
	about to happen.

	ANGLE - OLD GUARD

	Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
	shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
	SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote 
	news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the 
	b.g., listening.

				OLD GUARD
		... train was bearin' down on us, 
		fast. I don't know how - it's still 
		kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
		and pushed him out of the bus.

				SHERIFF
		You coulda both been killed.

				OLD GUARD
		I know, but hell, he's my partner.
		Woulda done the same for me.

	The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard 
	eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

				GERARD
		Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy 
		U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.

				SHERIFF
			(annoyed)
		I'll be with you in a minute.

	The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
	his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos 
	of all four prisoners.

				SHERIFF
			(to Old Guard)
		For the record. These three dead. 
		And this one...

	He switches to a photo of Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
		Well, everything happened so fast...
			(bites lip, decides)
		Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

	Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred 
	prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

				SHERIFF
		You get some rest.

	He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

				SHERIFF
		Looks like you came a long way for 
		nothing. My men've already done a 
		thorough search from point of 
		impact and found nothing.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	ANGLE - CULVERT

	Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees 
	something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

	GERARD

	Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

				GERARD
		With all due respect, may I suggest 
		check-points starting at a 15-mile 
		radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east 
		of -

				SHERIFF
		Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? 
		Prisoners are all dead. The only 
		thing check-points will do is get a 
		lot of good people out here frantic 
		and flood my office with calls.

	Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and 
	we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

				GERARD
			(beat)
		Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for 
		that to happen... So, I'll be 
		taking over the investigation.

				SHERIFF
		On whose authority?

				GERARD
		By authority of the Governor of the 
		State of Illinois and the office of
		the United States Marshal, 5th 
		District Northern Illinois...

	Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents 
	from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

				SHERIFF
			(back-down beat)
		Okay. You want jurisdiction over 
		this mess, you got it.
			(to assistants)
		Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
		mop up for us.

	He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
	Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
	manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

	Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
	a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

				GERARD
		Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
		back and give this poor man some 
		room.

	Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a 
	change of story and command.

	Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the 
	Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

				GERARD
			(friendly, to Old 
			Guard)
		Always an interesting thing when we 
		find leg irons and no legs in them 
		who held the keys, sir?

				OLD GUARD
		Uh, me.

				GERARD
		Would you be so kind as to show them
		to me, sir?

	Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

	The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the 
	press hovering just out of earshot.

				GERARD
		Second chance.

	Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

	The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

				OLD GUARD
			(cracking)
		He mighta got out.

				GERARD
		Thank you.

				SHERIFF
		What the hell is this? A minute ago 
		you tell me he's part of the 
		wreckage, now you're -

				GERARD
		Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want 
		an accurate body count. Poole - Set 
		up operations right here.

	He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving 
	downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like 
	Israelites behind Moses.

				GERARD
		Ladies and gentlemen... our 
		fugitive's been on the run for 
		ninety minutes. Average foot speed 
		over uneven ground - barring injury 
		is approximately four miles an hour, 
		giving us a radius of six miles. I 
		want a hard-target search of any 
		residence, gas station, farmhouse, 
		henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in 
		that area. Check-points go up at 
		15 miles.
			(to media)
		You got that? Good. Now, turn 
		those damn things off and get out 
		of our way.

	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a
	dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

	EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

	Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. 
	The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment 
	later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

	EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with 
	blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's 
	going to need stitches.

	Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps 
	moving.

	EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN

	Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction 
	of the lights.

	A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the 
	road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 
	mile.

	ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM

	Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
	nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
	He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
	jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
	breath.

	Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
	the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
	cover behind the wrecked car.

	The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
	seat and closes the door.

	He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
	something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
	and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the 
	coveralls missing from the seat.

	As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
	side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
	clutching the coveralls.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN

	A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the 
	crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone 
	lines are pulled down from the lines running along the 
	tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

	Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and 
	relays it to Gerard.

				POOLE
		Blood trail found. Two miles 
		southwest.

				GERARD
			(to Biggs)
		Type it and match it against all 
		four prisoners.
			(to Renfro)
		Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to 
		every local hospital.
			(to Newman)
		Newman...

	Newman appears.

				NEWMAN
		Yes, sir...

				GERARD
		I need some coffee.

	As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING 
	from the train crash.

	ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH

	A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

				WORKER
		Hey, one's alive!

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

	Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food 
	outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck 
	operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. 
	Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

	A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a 
	bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us.
	Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front 
	of the doorway.

	KIMBLE'S POV - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble closes the door and locks it. Hanging on the back of

	An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside.

	CUT TO:

	CLOTH-COVERED INSTRUMENT TRAY

	On it we see: A packaged sterilized bandage, an opened

	syringe. We PULL BACK to find:

	KIMBLE

	His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches 
	already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as 
	he sutures himself.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LONG SHOT (MOS) - MORNING

	At far end of the hall we see a STATE TROPER chatting with a 
	DUTY NURSE at a nurses' station.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROCEDURE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot 
	of antibiotics.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY

	A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes 
	closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.

	KIMBLE
	Can you hear me, sir?

	No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the 
	patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his 
	clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched 
	breakfast tray.

	CUT TO:

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - NURSES' DUTY STATION - DAY

	The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins 
	coming through on DESK FAX.

				NURSE
		There's your fax...

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble dressing in the man's clothes. He eats a piece of 
	toast - part of the man's breakfast - as he buttons up his 
	shirt.

	ANGLE - PATIENT

	His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call 
	button.

	CUT TO:

	INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

	A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the 
	duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the 
	patient's call light comes on.

	The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the 
	patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the 
	patient's room.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the 
	patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

				DUTY NURSE (O.S.)
		Mr. Patterson, do you need some more 
		water?

	ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST

	The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.

				DUTY NURSE
		... Oh, you did a good job on this.

	She takes his empty plastic pitcher and...

	... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and 
	refills the pitcher from the sink.

				DUTY NURSE
			(over her shoulder, 
			to patient)
		... It does get dry in here, doesn't 
		it?

	She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes 
	into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind 
	it.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and 
	a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency 
	room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the 
	E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts 
	down the corridor toward Kimble.

	The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

				TROOPER
		'Scuse me, Doc?...

	Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. 
	doors behind him.

				TROOPER
		... Don't know if you heard or not 
		but we're looking for an escaped 
		prisoner from that bus train wreck 
		'couple hours ago. Thought he might 
		show up here if he was hurt.

				KIMBLE
		What's he look like?

	The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow 
	trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down 
	Kimble's cheek.

				TROOPER
			(from fax sheet)
		Approximately six one, 180 pounds, 
		brown hair, brown eyes and beard.

	At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes 
	it clean as the Trooper looks up.

				TROOPER
		... Seen anyone that fits that 
		description?

				KIMBLE
		Every time I look in the mirror ...
		but without the beard.

	They laugh.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me...

				TROOPER
		Sure.

	Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks 
	outside...

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY

	Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The 
	lead wheels are stuck.

				KIMBLE
		Here...

	Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney 
	comes free.

				PARAMEDIC #2
		Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out 
		from under a train.

	As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face 
	of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

				YOUNG GUARD
		It's him... It's -

	Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young 
	Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

				KIMBLE
		How is he?

	The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

				PARAMEDIC #1
		He's pretty bad off. Broken leg, 
		ribs. Concussion.

	As Kimble moves away...

				KIMBLE
		Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got 
		a perforated spleen.

	He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk 
	the Young Guard inside.

				PARAMEDIC #2
			(impressed)
		Jesus, how could he tell that from 
		looking at his face?

	ANGLE - AMBULANCE

	Kimble climbs behind the wheel.

	EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	A full communications link is in place.

	Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information 
	to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole 
	calls Gerard.

				POOLE
		Background just came in from 
		Chicago.

				GERARD
		Hit me.

	Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of 
	information comes clear and fast.

				RENFRO
		Richard David Kimble. Vascular 
		Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree 
		murder in the killing of his wife. 
		Pleaded innocent. Claimed a 
		one-armed -

				GERARD
		Let's not retry the case. Priors
		and accomplices?

	Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the 
	investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.

				RENFRO
		None. No previous arrests.

	Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard 
	unzips his fly and relieves himself.

				GERARD
		Sealed juvie record?

	Poole calls out from behind tree.

				POOLE
		Nothing. Total cherry.

				GERARD
		Relatives? Children?

				RENFRO
		No relatives.

				POOLE
		One child. A son. Died in drowning 
		accident three years ago.

				GERARD
		Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends? 
		Combinations of the above?

				POOLE
		Lot of friends. Doctors. Hospital 
		staff.

	Gerard zips up.

				GERARD
		Start there. Authorize taps. Cover
		his lawyer first.

				RENFRO
		Never get it.

				GERARD
		Bet me.

	Renfro won't take it.

				GERARD
		Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, 
		he'll sign 'em.

	... Biggs charges up the hillside.

				BIGGS
		DeLange Hospital. Wounded guard 
		swears to High Holy he saw Kimble 
		right there in the hallway. 
		Ambulance, missing too.

	ANGLE - SITUATION TENT

	Gerard moves quickly to the map.

				GERARD
		Give me a time.

				BIGGS
		O-nine-thirty. Twenty minutes ago.

	Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we 
	covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn, 
	tightened, with the hospital as its center. The 
	triangulation is set.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. RURAL RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

	The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad 
	crossing.

				COP (V.O.)
		... We're waiting up here in Canton.
		Wondering if you heard anything on 
		this Kimble chase -

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad 
	crossing. The biocom monitors police chatter:

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		Two-twelve-A, be advised that all 
		discussion on this matter is to be 
		conducted on a tactical frequency 
		- either Channel K or Z. Over.

	Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield:

	ROAD SIGN

	An arrow points toward Canton, two miles.

	The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal 
	suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops 
	the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and 
	heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets 
	attention.

	INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

	Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and 
	reaches for his C.B. radio.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

	Poole hangs up phone.

				POOLE
		Ambulance just spotted two miles 
		west of Doverville. Heading north 
		on State road 53.

	Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much 
	smaller.

				RENFRO
		Running outta map, Sam.

	The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is 
	ready to move.

				GERARD
		Just the way we want it. Okay, 
		people, let's button up.

	They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and 
	eyeballs folded roadmap...

	EXT. SECONDARY ROAD (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the 
	Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.

	EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and 
	G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of 
	Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS 
	overhead.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance. 
	Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain.

				PILOT
			(into radio)
		We've got a visual...
			(to Gerard)
		He's heading toward the viaduct.

				GERARD
		Seal it up.

	EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY

	The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred 
	feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.

	The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into 
	the tunnel.

	ON KIMBLE

	Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at 
	the mouth of the tunnel.

	Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.

	ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)

	Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far 
	entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.

	ANGLE HELICOPTER

	Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.

	KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE

	Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. 
	Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.

	EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking 
	the other end.

	Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a 
	State patrol car blares:

				P.A. (V.O.)
		Please remain in your vehicles and 
		lock your doors. Repeat, please 
		remain in -

	ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

	Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar. 
	They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a 
	vest.

				RENFRO
		Got him.

	Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.

				GERARD
		Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard 
		part's over.

	He starts into the tunnel.

				RENFRO
			(to radio)
		We're movin' in.

	INT. TUNNEL - DAY

	Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three 
	silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' 
	P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb 
	back inside and lock their doors.

	Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the 
	middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

	Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the 
	ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain 
	clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

	Running water.

	ON MARSHALS

	They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks 
	around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks 
	confused.

				POOLE
		Where'd he go?

	Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until 
	he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.

				GERARD
		Biggs, Renfro with me.

	INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows 
	at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. 
	A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips 
	off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues 
	straight ahead.

	Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit
	wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong 
	to...

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the 
	forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

				GERARD
		Channel Three.

	They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go 
	left. Gerard - straight ahead.

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy 
	downslope.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Biggs and Renfro. Sweeping his light as he advances. 
	Searching for splash-patterns.

				BIGGS
			(into shoulder-mike)
		Nothing yet.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard. Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light. About to 
	pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the 
	branch-off tunnel. Hand marks?

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Got a possible here. Stand by.

	He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with 
	three limbs

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. 
	Slips again...

	... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

	Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. 
	Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
	lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
	there first.

	It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
	flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

				KIMBLE
		I didn't kill my wife.

				GERARD
		So, you didn't kill your wife.

	Not my problem.

	An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
	silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

				BIGGS (V.O.)
		Gerard? You there?

	Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

	Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up 
	piece.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro 
	appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...

				GERARD
		Straight ahead!

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance 
	in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead 
	lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is 
	incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and 
	stops.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam 
	disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of 
	mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

	He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.

	ANGLE - MARSHALS

	Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a 
	shooting stance.

				GERARD
		Turn around, hands over your head. 
		And get down on the ground.

	For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

				GERARD
		Your choice, Kimble...

	Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
	water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
	up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
	water toward Kimble.

				GERARD
		Get down on your knees.

	Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the 
	footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY

	Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap 
	into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into 
	the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

	INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY

	Renfro lowers his gun.

				RENFRO
			(amazed)
		Son of a bitch...

	It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

	ON GERARD

	He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He 
	stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him 
	something invaluable about this fugitive.

	EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY

	Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam 
	near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search 
	helicopter converge on the site.

	EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

	Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

	The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down 
	stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET

	Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the 
	shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

	Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

	FROM SHORE

	Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
	the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
	ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Running out of daylight, Inspector.

				GERARD
		Lights and generators are coming, 
		Captain.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Look, I don't mean to tell you your 
		job, but maybe one person in a 
		million could've survived that fall.
		The guy's fish food.

	Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

				GERARD
		Then find me the fish that ate him.

	He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

	EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

	Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a 
	sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, 
	exhausted.

	KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY

	ANGLE

	Helen in bed. Kimble's hand comes INTO FRAME and touches 
	her shoulder. She turns toward Kimble as he moves INTO 
	FRAME and kisses her.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	ANGLE

	Helen tosses her head back. She wears white silk pajamas 
	and smiles down AT us. A hand reaches up and unbuttons the 
	top two buttons of her top. Then Kimble moves up INTO FRAME 
	as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BEACH - DAY

	Helen running down beach TOWARD us. Embraces Kimble as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POOL - DAY

	Helen's head comes up out of a pool. Hair tossed back, she 
	smiles as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Helen exiting Kimble's car the night of the murder. She 
	looks back at Kimble, framed by the door frame, ant smiles.

				HELEN
		Good-bye. I love you.

	Again... Then again... then:

	HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. FOREST - MORNING

	Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He 
	remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.

	EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING

	Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into 
	tunnel.

	INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

	Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for 
	party 
	to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

	Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

	ANGLE - PHONE

	Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear 
	RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan 
		and Wainwright.

				KIMBLE
		Walter Gutherie please.

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left 
		for the day, would you like his 
		voice mail?

	Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front 
	of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the 
	shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he 
	sees the pharmacist looking at him.

	EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a 
	new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, 
	moves down the road to the diner.

	INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER 
	WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and 
	tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need to look at the menu?

				KIMBLE
		Some soup, please.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Good choice.

	She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around 
	Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

	A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
	stares at him.

	A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
	away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
	he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

	Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
	his soup. Where's the first waitress?

	Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
	sees:

	The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
	going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

	A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

	ANGLE - TV

	A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the 
	chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death 
	from the fall.

	Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on 
	the counter and exits.

	EXT. DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until 
	he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of 
	the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

	Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both 
	sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly 
	hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
	faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
	a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
	inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
	chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
	looks at himself. He's shaking.

	A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next 
	to him, passenger window rolls down...

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need a ride?

	Kimble stares at her.

				KIMBLE
		Which way are you going?

	She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. 
	They hold a look as we hear:

				RENFRO (V.O.)
		We feel confident about the I.D.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

	A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless 
	woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly 
	down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just 
	early morning traffic.

	We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the 
	street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
	that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
	woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
	radio.

				RENFRO
		Local officials were about to wet 
		their pants to move in.

				GERARD
		I bet they were.
			(to radio)
		Where's the woman?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	BIGGS

	In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

				RENFRO
			(into radio)
		Same room.

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and 
		Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. 
		I don't want anyone hurt. Stay 
		outside unless called. Radios on 
		three.

	The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his 
	service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.

				NEWMAN
		Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?

				GERARD
		Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
		Let's go.

	EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAWN

	DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of 
	the door.

				GERARD
		U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!

	INT. HOUSE - DAWN

	Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

	THEIR POV

	Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
	OF VIEW.

	A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

	GERARD

	Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
	room while he moves down the main hall into the back 
	bedroom.

	ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN

	Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
	off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
	He steps into -

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
	the bedroom.

	HALLWAY

	Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
	continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
	woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
	silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
	opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
	the doorway to the kitchen.

	Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
	He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
	Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

	CUT TO:

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
	didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

	COPELAND

	Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
	Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
	knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
	room.

	We...

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		I got your man! Now I want outta 
		here!

	Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
	woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
	fugitive.

	ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN

	Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
	through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

	LIVING ROOM

	Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
	his throat.

				COPELAND
			(to Gerard)
		You hear me? I said, I want out or 
		I'll cut your man's throat!

	GERARD

	Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
	at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

	LIVING ROOM

	Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
	hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

	Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
	whips Newman around and we see:

	A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
	late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

	He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
	The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
	stunned but unhurt.

	Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
	bedroom doorway.

				GERARD
		Shut up.

	She does. Immediately.

	EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

	As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
	the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
	sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
	hysterical, clutching his ear.

				NEWMAN
		My ear... I can't hear a thing out 
		of it. I can't believe you did that!

				GERARD
		You think I should have bargained 
		with him, don't you?

				NEWMAN
		Yes. You could've missed! You 
		could've killed me!

				GERARD
		Yeah, you're absolutely right. I 
		could've.

	They hold a look.

				GERARD
		How bad's your ear?

				NEWMAN
		Terrible. I probably have permanent 
		hearing damage.

				GERARD
		Let me see it.

	Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

				GERARD
		I don't bargain.

	Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
	unsettling man Gerard is.

				KIMBLE
		I wasn't worrying about appearances, 
		Walter.
	
				GUTHERIE
		Tell me where you are. I'll come
		meet you so you can turn yourself 
		in .

				KIMBLE
		I'm not turning myself in. I need 
		money.

	Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on 
	the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard. You're asking me to harbor
		and aid a convicted felon... I can't
		help you that way. My advice - both 
		as a friend and as your legal counsel 
		- is for you to give yourself up. 
		Now tell me... where are you?

	Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

				KIMBLE

	INT. NORTH BANK TENNIS CLUB - DAY

	An upscale mid-town tennis club. Behind glass windows of 
	the entryway we see tennis courts. From the courts comes Dr. 
	Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his

	goes by.

				DESK ATTENDANT
		See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?

	As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves 
	toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield. 
	Nichols waves the man off.

				NICHOLS
		Not today, please.

	The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his 
	passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

				NICHOLS
		No. Not -

	... then stops - the face at his passenger window is 
	Richard Kimble's.

				NICHOLS
			(stunned)
		Oh, my God... Richard...

	Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

				KIMBLE
		How're you doing, Charlie?

				NICHOLS
		You're alive...

				KIMBLE
		Yeah. And I need your help.

				NICHOLS
		Anything.

				KIMBLE
		I need some money. Whatever you've 
		got on you.

				NICHOLS
		Of course.
	
	Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs 
	for his wallet...

				NICHOLS
		Tell me where you're staying. I'll 
		get you more money. Some clothes. 
		Just give me an address...

				KIMBLE
		I'll call you.

	Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks 
	back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the 
	corner and come up the street behind them.

	Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to 
	Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

				NICHOLS
		I know why you came back - to find 
		him. If I can help, call me... 
		Call me.

	They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they 
	don't see it.

				KIMBLE
		Thanks, Charlie...

				NICHOLS
		Here, Richard, take my coat...

	He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car 
	behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview 
	mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

				COP
			(to Nichols)
		Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.

	Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

	INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

				GERARD
		Call them back. Tell them you've 
		made a mistake.

				POOLE
		What?

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		Stop it there.

	Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

				GERARD
		Drop the voices.

	Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the 
	BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC, 
	MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the 
	sounds now.

				GERARD
			(he's heard something)
		Listen.

				BIGGS
		Trains? Traffic?

				GERARD
		More... there's a voice in the 
		background.

	At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING 
	MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop 
	Merchandise Mart."

				RENFRO
		That's an El announcement.

				GERARD
		And there's no E1 in St. Louis. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble
		is in Chicago. Poole, get his 
		artwork out to local police and have 
		C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, 
		bring in the detectives that handled 
		his case.

	Instantly the room is in movement.

				STEVENS
		I'll prepare the press release.

				GERARD
		No.

	Stevens stops.

				GERARD
		They don't know he's alive and as 
		far as Kimble knows we don't either. 
		I want to keep it that way as long 
		as we can. Are we clear?

	The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to 
	Kimble.

				RENFRO
			(for the group)
		Perfectly.

	Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.

	down hallway and enters.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

	He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks

	called. On his lap we see a prosthetic arm. Kimble looks up 
	from the arm to the man.

	the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping 
	bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces 
	of furniture.

	Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show 
	where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the 
	place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY

	Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning 
	supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation

	Kelly and Rossetti share a look, a smile.

	watches Kimble.

				ROSETTI (V.O.)
		We found nothing.

	The Polish woman shows him a spare but sufficient bed and 
	nightstand set up. She points to door leading up to the 
	street.

	CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE WOMAN'S BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Kimble also at work at the bedside table. He carefully cuts 
	out his do-it-yourself photograph and places it over the 
	existing photograph on the hospital I.D. The name on the 
	I.D. says: Desmondo Jose Ruiz. Then he places a thin piece 
	of lamination plastic and trims the edges.

	Kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look, then 
	examines the finished product not bad.

	INT. MARSHALS' OFFICE - DAY

				KELLY (O.S.)
		If this guy existed believe me

	young Richard Kimble and Charles Nichols.

				NICHOLS (O.S.)
		Richard Kimble... I saw him two 
		days ago.

	WE PULL BACK to see: Gerard studying the photos. Renfro 
	looks up like someone's bitten him. He, Biggs and Gerard are 
	in Nichols' administrative office. Gleaming. Filled with 
	awards and photos of Nichols and influential people. Nichols
	hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat. He 
	shows no sign of nervousness.

				NICHOLS
		He stopped me in my car. I gave him 
		some money.

				GERARD
		Where was this?

				NICHOLS
		Outside our tennis -
			(correcting himself)
		 - my tennis club.

	Gerard moves around Nichols' office taking in the details.

				GERARD
		Did he ask you for help?

				NICHOLS
		I volunteered. He wouldn't accept 
		it.

				GERARD
		Why do you think he came back to 
		Chicago?

				NICHOLS
		He didn't tell me.

				GERARD
		I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure
		he was trying to protect you from 
		having to lie for him.

	Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, 
	books, drawings, awards and photos.

				GERARD
		If you're really his friend, you'll 
		help us bring him in unharmed.

				NICHOLS
		Why, so he can go back to prison? 
		If you want help, gentlemen, you've 
		come to the wrong man.

	Gerard finds a photo of Nichols and a gleaming Ferrari.

				GERARD
		Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. 
		Marshals' office closed out 11,003 
		warrants... 10,975 of those were 
		captured. The twenty-eight others 
		thought they were smarter than 
		us... Now they're dead.
			(re: the photo)

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble mopping the trauma room hallway. The hallway elbows 
	around a corner and Kimble stands less than ten feet from 
	a door that is marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

	He watches a technician leave the clinic and mops closer to 
	the doorway, and fails to see an attractive WOMAN DOCTOR 
	with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn 
	the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped 
	section.

	Head down, she is completely absorbed in a file and doesn't
	see the wet floor until she slips slightly, looks up but 
	keeps walking.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Where's Rudy?

				KIMBLE
		They said he's sick.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Didn't they tell you to put up the 
		sign?

				KIMBLE
		Uhhh. No they didn't.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Put up the 'wet floor' sign before 
		someone gets hurt.

	She keeps going.

				KIMBLE
			(mumbles)
		Asshole.

	She looks back at Kimble.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		What did you say?

				KIMBLE
		Nothing.

	Anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall. He watches her 
	turn the corner to the trauma hallway.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab.

	He moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms, 
	hands, legs hanging from the ceiling. Cables and electronic 
	equipment are on the counters.

	He leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the 
	Prosthetic Clinic. He passes a computer room and finally 
	reaches the office. He is about to enter when a woman's 
	voice stops him.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Hey, Ricky... Weren't you just in 
		here?

	Kimble turns to see a PROSTHETIC TECHNICIAN. A large woman 
	with glasses. She stands with a partially finished 
	prosthetic arm.

	MEMORY HIT - INT. KIMBLE'S OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

				TECHNICIAN
		Naw... I'm going to be here all 
		night. You won't bother me.

	She slips on a pair of headphones and goes back to work.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC OFFICE - LATER

	"ANNE EASTMAN". She sees him doing the rearranging.

	The elevator arrives. They step into:

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Anne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side.

				ANNE (WOMAN DOCTOR)
		Hey, how're you doing?

				KIMBLE
		Fine.

				ANNE
		You find that sign?

				KIMBLE
		Yes, I did.

				ANNE
		You called me an asshole.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me. I was having a bad 
		shift.

	They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.

				ANNE
		You worked at other hospitals?

				KIMBLE
		Lots of them over the years. Here, 
		long ago. Hasn't changed much.

				ANNE
		I bet it hasn't. See you.

	They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops 
	and watches him leave.

	INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

	Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking 
	at his information.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

	Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets 
	of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over 
	Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, 
	making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
	attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
	for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

	Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
	on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
	covers his face.

	Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
	Prosthetic Clinic material.

	FLASHBACK - FIGHT

	Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's 
	sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

	returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

	his way.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

	He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees 
	the back courtyard covered by more cops.

	Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
	he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

	He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of 
	charging through the basement door they move up the front 
	steps and into the house overhead.

	Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

	KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS

	Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He 
	runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, 
	actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and
	pulled away.

	KIMBLE

	Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the 
	Punk Kid out to the car.

	POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.

	Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.

		A bus flipped off the overpass. Got
		at least twenty more coming in.

	Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out
	of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.

				ANNE
		Hey, take this one up the hall to
		Critical Care.

	Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

	Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the 
	hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays.

	Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble 
	pushing the gurney and looking at the film.

	ANNE

	Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a 
	better look, but Kimble is gone. She goes back to work.

	A Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the 
	gurney.

				KIMBLE
		They just sent this one up.

	He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and 
	yells to O.R. nurse.

				SURGEON
		Bob! Get this one into room four, 
		stat.

	He looks up, Kimble is gone.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The 
	Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman,
	sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the 
	glass-walled computer room and closes the door.

	He closes the blinds and turns on the computer.

		For what?

				GERARD
		For murdering his wife.

	Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her 
	surprise.

				GERARD
		Thank you for your help, Doctor.

	He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's 
	gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that 
	place. Renfro and the other deputies converge.

				RENFRO
		What I can't figure is, if you were 
		Kimble, why'd you take a major

	Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices 
	something.

		The place would be crawling with cops.

	Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and 
	follows the Man down the hall.

	The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the 
	Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, 
	holds the hallway door open for Gerard.

				MAN
		Can I help you find something?

	Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.

	Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be 
	any dark-haired man. But still...

		Kimble.

	Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two

	Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

	is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door 
	- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

	Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
	Gerard.

	Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - 
	but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,

	Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
	alive. He runs free.

				GERARD
		Open the doors!

	Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the 
	glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. 
	It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble 
	rush across the street and disappear into the parade.

	He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus 
	shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
	parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
	across the seat and opens the door for him.

	He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in,

				SYKES
		Wait a minute... This is the doctor

		You telling me he's coming after

				GERARD
		Would he have a reason to?

				SYKES
		What the hell's that supposed to 
		mean? Because I have this?

	He lifts his prosthetic arm and stares at Gerard. Gerard 
	holds his look.

				SYKES
		Look, a year ago some people came 
		to see me. They asked me questions 
		about the night of the murder and 
		I'll tell you the same thing I told
		them. I wasn't even in town then. 
		I was on a business trip.

	Gerard continues moving around the apartment.

		What kind of business are you in,

				SYKES
		Security.

				GERARD
		Independent?

				SYKES
		No, I work for a pharmaceutical

	Gerard holds up one of the fishing photographs with Lentz.

				GERARD
		Any idea why Kimble would be 
		interested in these?

				SYKES
		No. Just some doctors on a company

	Gerard puts the photos down with the one of Lentz on top. 
	Sykes eyes it.

				SYKES

		Look, you mind if I talk to the cops

				KIMBLE
		It's all about a drug, Charlie. They

		Who?

				KIMBLE
		Devlin-MacGregor and Lentz. Lentz 
		was supervising the R.D.U.90

		Unless... What if you were a well

		Set it up to look like a robbery 
		gone bad.

		How would you find him? Look in the

				RENFRO
		Through a connection.

				POOLE
		Maybe through a company you did some 
		business with.

				BIGGS
		Like a pharmaceutical company. 
		Someone in security.

				NEWMAN
		On the night of his wife's murder, 
		Kimble attended a hospital benefit 
		sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor 
		Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company.

	Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board.

				BIGGS
		But Sykes claims he was out of town.

				POOLE
		And company records support that he 
		was on a business trip.

				RENFRO
		That's an easy fix. So let's say he 
		was in town. Did the job. Everything 
		goes as planned with one problem.

	  			NEWMAN
		Instead of looking like a robbery 
		gone bad, Kimble ends up being the 
		one accused...

		... tried, convicted...

				POOLE
		... and the hit man gets away clean.

				RENFRO
		So Kimble returns to hunt for and 
		find the hit man.

		Why? To share the blame? He'd still 
		go to prison.

	Gerard moves to the board. He takes down a card.

	Cop's guns out. People back out of his way. He moves to 
	where the first two windows extend over the platform, kicks 
	out the front window and...

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

	... drops to the station platform. Kimble lowers his head and 
	moves down the uncrowded platform to the station.

	INT. GERARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The report comes off the scanner.

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		... units in the vicinity of Balbo 
		Street station. Be alert to possible 
		sighting of Richard Kimble...

	Gerard, Renfro and Poole trade looks. Gerard moves toward 
	the door.

				RENFRO
		Balbo station. That's -

				GERARD

		Poole, get Biggs and Newman.

	They're gone as we -

	CUT TO:

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	Police cruisers pull outside the station.

	INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	As transit police move up the escalator to the platform, 
	Kimble moves unnoticed through the underground mall 
	beneath the hotel. Deposits the guns into a mail box and 
	keeps moving.

	INT. GERARD'S CAR - NIGHT

	Renfro driving, Gerard and Pool in car. Report comes over 
	the radio.

				POLICE DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		... all units in vicinity of Balbo 
		E1. Officer down. Repeat, officer 
		down. Man leaving scene with two 
		guns matches description of Richard 
		Kimble...

	Gerard looks out the window, he knows what this means.

				GERARD
			(quietly to himself)
		Damn...

	INT. HOTEL - MALL LEVEL / LOBBY - NIGHT

	Kimble moves up escalators from the underground station 
	into the Hilton.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Disheveled and driven, he moves from the escalators to the 
	lobby - checks the list of hospitality suites and sees 
	board which indicates Nichols speech in the rooftop 
	ballroom. He moves on to the main elevators.

	CUT TO:

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Nichols speaking. As he talks we MOVE TO...

	ANGLE ON TABLE OF MEN

	Listening - the same men we saw in the hospitality suite 
	when Nichols talked to Kimble. As we MOVE TIGHTER ON one 
	of the men, we notice his name tag says: Board of 
	Directors... Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

	INT. HILTON ROOFTOP ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Kimble rides alone to the rooftop ballroom.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	Gerard's car pulls up in front of the hotel. Police are 
	controlling pedestrians. Newman and Biggs, already decked 
	out in Kevlar, meet him.

				NEWMAN
		C.P.D. just reported -

				GERARD
		I heard. Was it Kimble?

				BIGGS
		Conflicting reports, but the cops 
		are considering him a shooter.

	Heavily-armed CPD units pull up. Gerard stares at the police 
	presence. He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is 
	conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain.

				POLICE CAPTAIN
		Witnesses say he entered hotel from 
		the subway.

				KELLY
		Okay. I want it locked down. Start 
		on the lower levels.

	The captain moves off. Gerard intercepts the cop.

				GERARD
		That's my man in there, Kelly.

				KELLY
		Not since he took down one of ours, 
		Gerard. This is a police matter,
		now. Stay, the hell, out of it.

	Kelly moves off. Gerard watches him a moment then he looks 
	up to the roof. Newman hands Gerard his belt with his 
	backup piece.

				GERARD
		C'mon, I know where he's going.

	He moves into the hotel with his deputies.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	LOCKDOWN MONTAGE - EXT. / INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	A) C.P.D. cruisers arriving. Cops deploying to points of 
	entry. Security guards keying shut parking garage and 
	blocking stairwells.

	B) Helicopter with police sharpshooters takes off from 
	Meigs Field downtown and heads for the hotel.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ROOFTOP ELEVATORS/PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble exits the elevators and moves down the corridor to 
	the ballroom. A man tries to stop him at the doors, Kimble 
	simply moves him out of the way and opens the doors to:

	CUT TO:

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Nichols moves to the last of his speech as Kimble enters 
	at the rear

				NICHOLS
		... And I especially would like to 
		thank my researchers who helped me...

	Nichols stops his speech - stunned to see Kimble.

				NICHOLS
		Richard...

				KIMBLE
		What's wrong, Charlie? Surprised?

	Kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of 
	doctors toward the podium.

	We see the faces of Kimble's colleagues and friends from 
	the ballroom sequence earlier. At first no one notices 
	Kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais, the 
	applause fades and then room quiets. Whispers of:

				CROWD
		It's Richard. It's Kimble.

	Stunned expressions.

	Kimble continues to the front, talking to Nichols as if 
	the room were empty.

				KIMBLE
		After Lentz died, you were the only 
		one that had access to the 
		pathology reports.

	Nichols remains calm.

				NICHOLS
		Reports? What are you?

				KIMBLE
		You switched the samples and 
		falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 
		could get approval.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I don't know what you're 
		talking about?...

				KIMBLE
		I have a set of the original 
		samples.

	Nichols stares at Kimble and for the first time we see a 
	flicker of concern.

				KIMBLE
		You almost pulled it off, Charlie. 
		But I know all about it now, and I 
		can prove it.

	Nichols and Kimble hold a look. Nichols turns to the audience.

				KIMBLE
		Ladies and gentlemen. My friend, as 
		you can see, is obviously not well. 
		Richard, if you want to talk -

				KIMBLE
		I didn't come here to talk

	Nichols leaves the dais and heads toward the exit.

	Kimble tracks along with him - moving through the tables - 
	passing the table with the Devlin-MacGregor board of 
	directors. They are disturbed by this situation.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moves through a door and exits into...

	HALLWAY

	Kimble follows moving through the tables and people to 
	reach the door.

	As soon as he's gone there are calls for "security." Doctors 
	move for the exits.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Gerard, Renfro, Newman, Biggs and Poole move into the lobby.
	Police move to cover the lower floors.

				BIGGS
		C.P.D. has the perimeter, hotel 
		security has the parking structure.

				GERARD
		Let them keep busy down below. 
		Newman, get with security. See if 
		you can locate Kimble from the 
		monitors. Keep in radio contact.

	Newman branches off to Hotel Security. The rest follow 
	Gerard to the rooftop elevators.

	EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARING over Chicago skyline. The bright red sign of the 
	Hilton Hotel looms ahead.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

	Nichols moves down hallway and turns into a hospitality 
	suite. A moment later Kimble follow and enters the...

	HOSPITALITY SUITE

	... and is immediately smashed with a chair by Nichols. 
	Kimble goes flying, stunned. Nichols locks the door.

				NICHOLS
		Your best quality, Richard, is that 
		you don't give up -

	Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet.

				NICHOLS
		... even when it's clearly in your 
		best interest to...

	He hits him again, drives him back into the library.

	Kimble tries to recover as Nichols relentlessly stays on 
	him. He pulls him up, slams him against the fire escape 
	doors.

				NICHOLS
		I always knew that I'd have to kill 
		you.

	He drives a blow into Kimble's stomach.

				NICHOLS
		Now, I must thank you for giving me 
		200 witnesses tonight who will 
		support me... when I tell them it 
		was self-defense...

	He shoves Kimble through the door out into...

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE BALCONY - NIGHT

	... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to 
	keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him, 
	but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks 
	Nichols back against the other side of fire escape.

				KIMBLE
		You missed your chance, Charlie...

	Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with 
	two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.

	Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a 
	security camera.

	CUT TO:

	INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

	A room lined with security monitors. Two security personnel 
	sit in front of their console. Newman stands behind them.

	On screen: We see Kimble moving down the stairs toward 
	Nichols, who pulls himself to his feet.

	Newman stands in front of the screen, talks to his radio.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		I've got Kimble on the roof with 
		Nichols. Southeast exit.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Gerard and deputies Poole, Biggs, and Renfro around him.

				BIGGS
			(to radio)
		Keep and eye on him. Biggs has roof plans.

				BIGGS
		There are four exits to the roof.

				GERARD
		I want them covered.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the 
	blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another 
	set of stairs to the roof.

				KIMBLE
		You took everything away from me... 
		for money.

	INT. BALLROOM ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor. The 
	elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented 
	doctors trying to escape. The marshals wade through, meet 
	up with two hotel security guards.

				GERARD
		This way.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by 
	the lights of the city skyline.

				KIMBLE
		I want to know, Charlie... was it 
		worth it...?

				NICHOLS
		This thing is bigger than even you 
		think, Richard. You can't stop it.

	He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him 
	against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the 
	street appears far below.

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom. 
	The deputies move to separate areas. Several doctors point 
	them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman stands in front the security monitors and watches 
	Kimble and Nichols on the roof.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the 
	HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits 
	the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter:

				VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.)
		Chicago police. Freeze.

	In the instant of shock, Nichols knees Kimble and bolts.

	INTERCUT:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

	Gerard moves down connecting hallway where a couple of 
	concerned doctors are trying to open the door to the 
	hospitality suite.

				GERARD
			(to doctors)
		Clear the hallway.
			(to security)
		Get that door open.

	The door opens and Gerard moves quickly through the 
	hospitality suite for the rooftop.

				GERARD
			(to security)
		Stay at this door.

	He moves through the door to the roof alone.

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman watching the security monitors sees Kimble and 
	Nichols. On another monitor we see Gerard exit the suite.

	EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

	Nichols runs.

	Kimble recovers, sees Gerard moving down the fire escape 
	toward him, and Nichols escaping. He goes after Nichols.

	The helicopter circles back over the roof, illuminating the 
	rooftop in its million-candle-power beam.

				HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
		I've got a visual on Kimble. He's 
		running.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Kelly listens on his ratio.

				KELLY
		Bring him down.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble chases Nichols down the roof as BULLETS from the 
	helicopter rip into the air conditioning duct next to Kimble.

	The helicopter swings out to keep Kimble in sight.

	ON GERARD

	Gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		This is a United States Marshal. 
		Get that helicopter out of here!

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He moves away among the duct work.

	Kimble follows.

	Gerard continues after Kimble.

	The helicopter circles and follows from above.

	INT. PENTHOUSE / DOOR TO ROOF - NIGHT

	Renfro triggers his radio.

				RENFRO
		There is a U.S. Marshal out there. 
		Hold your fire!

	HELICOPTER'S POV

	FOLLOWING Kimble. Its beam tracking Kimble across the 
	rooftop. He moves through the blowers and duct work. 
	Kimble is gaining ground on Nichols.

	ON SHARPSHOOTER

	He is about to fire when he hears through his radio.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Hold your fire.

	The shooter pulls back.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard rushes across the roof toward Kimble.

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He is almost to the end of the roof when Kimble tackles 
	him. The two men crash against sloped glass roof of an 
	elevator housing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Inside the shaft - an elevator moves toward the roof. It 
	stops on the floor ten feet below the roof. THROUGH the 
	glass roof we see the doors open.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - GERARD - NIGHT

	Charges toward -

	KIMBLE

	Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED 
	GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.

	Nichols' head rocks from the impact.

	The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins 
	to drop.

	Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams 
	him down hard again.

	HELICOPTER

	Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and 
	Gerard closing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	The elevator doors close and the car beneath the 
	skylight begins to descend.

	GERARD

	Pulls up.

				GERARD
		Kimble!

	Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass 
	and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble 
	and Nichols into...

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft 
	and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. 
	Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble 
	hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping 
	himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An 
	elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the 
	shaft.

	GERARD'S POV

	Kimble's car disappears into the darkness.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR - NIGHT

	Nichols pulls himself to his feet. Hits the emergency 
	stop and the doors open. He disappears into...

	INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the 
	giant machines.

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
	carefully into the laundry.

	... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
	DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
	move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
	heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

	... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
	stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by 
	conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

	The NOISE is DEAFENING.

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		Where did the elevator stop?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	NEWMAN IN SECURITY

	Newman checks the computer board for the elevator 
	position.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		Level five.

	INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
	exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
	grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

	KIMBLE

	Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
	stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
	the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
	between the large conveyors.

	ANGLE - SORTING ROOM

	Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
	standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

				GERARD
		Get out of here.

	He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
	worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
	rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
	switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
	takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
	main room.

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		We're going in. Give me five 
		minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.

	He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main 
	room.

	INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

	He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

	He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
	dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
	him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

	Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
	voice from the other end of the laundry.

				GERARD (V.O.)
			(above the din)
		Kimble!

	Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
	where Gerard enters.

	ON GERARD

	The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

	They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
	up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
	move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
	equipment.

				GERARD
		... There is no way out of here.

	The building is locked down.

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
	the conveyor belts.

				GERARD (O.S.)
		Kimble... I know about Nichols. I 
		know about Sykes. Kimble stops.

	ON GERARD

				GERARD
		... Nichols borrowed your car the 
		night of the murder and called 
		Sykes from it.

	RENFRO

	Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
	comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
	dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

	KIMBLE

	Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
	Nichols.

	GERARD

	Moving through the forest of massive bags.

				GERARD
		... That's why there was no forced 
		entry at your house. He'd used your 
		keys.

	KIMBLE 

	Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

	NICHOLS

	Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
	killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
	chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
	hanging control for the I-beam.

	GERARD

	Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
	dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
	see straight back toward the washers. 

				GERARD
		Kimble... Come meet me out here.

	ON RENFRO

	He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
	under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
	WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
	rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
	opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

	NICHOLS

	Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
	shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
	Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

	GERARD

	Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor 
	belts. He makes one last appeal.

				GERARD
		It's time to quit running... if you 
		don't, you know I'll stop you. He 
		listens, there is no answer.

	KIMBLE

	Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
	shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

	GERARD

	Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
	pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
	on us...

	NICHOLS

	Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
	before he fires however he hears...

				KIMBLE (O.S.)
		Hey, Chuckles...

	Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
	and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
	behind Gerard.

	GERARD

	Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
	with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
	instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

	Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

	They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
	room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

	INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

	Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan 
	Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie 
	for space in front of the Hilton Towers.

	Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an 
	ambulance. The doors close.

	REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk 
	giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom. 
	We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them 
	TOWARD the entrance.

				T.V. NEWS REPORTER
		... As we reported a few minutes 
		ago, the saga of once-prominent 
		Chicago surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble,

		was captured at the Chicago Hilton...

	ANOTHER REPORTER continues:

				ANOTHER REPORTER
		... there are unconfirmed reports 
		from police of new evidence which 
		may exonerate Kimble while 
		implicating some of the biggest 
		names in medicine...

	The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of 
	photographs.

	A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the 
	ballroom:

				STUNNED DOCTOR
		He just walked in... We didn't know 
		what he was going to do. My wife 
		was very frightened... The next 
		thing I knew cops were charging in 
		and...

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole 
	and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos. 
	Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics.

	EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT

	As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights 
	flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd 
	forward, yelling questions.

				REPORTER
		Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove 
		your innocence!

	Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

				GERARD
			(to police)
		Get them back.

	The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into 
	a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back 
	door and helps Kimble inside.

				BIGGS
		Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.

	Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next 
	to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

				GERARD
			(to Poole)
		Poole, you got that thing?
			(to Kimble)
		Give me your hands.

	Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks 
	Kimble's handcuffs.

	Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the 
	pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

				GERARD
		Take care of those hands, Doc, 
		you're going to need them again 
		soon.

				KIMBLE
		I thought you told me 'you didn't 
		care.'

				GERARD
		Yeah, well, don't spread it around.

	They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

	HELICOPTER POV

	The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading 
	back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at 
	first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined 
	by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the 
	traffic, movement and lights of the city.

     A1. TITLES OVER "HOME MOVIES" from the 1960's -- FLICKERING, GRAINY,
     HAND-HELD, KODACHROME COLORS.  MUSIC OVER.

     1.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (HOME MOVIES)

     A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAY BOY with a blindfold spins round and
     round, the HANDS of OTHER CHILDREN keep him spinning.  MAIN TITLE.
     It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.  The dizzy boy is given
     a strip of felt, and the CAMERA follows as he stumbles toward a
     large cardboard donkey.  He pins the tail on its nose.

     2. QUICK, RAGGED CUTS-- the BOY blows out candles... opens gifts...
     a CLOWN ties balloon animals.  CHILDREN, MAIDS and BUTLERS hover
     about; there's even a real-live PONY.  The party take splace in the
     gardens of a massive Pacific Heights MANSION.

     3. THE BOY is SCHUYLER VAN ORTON (7), and this is his birthday
     party.  He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he
     poses for a shot with his mother, MRS. VAN ORTON, a stiff-looking
     society matron.  A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places
     the baby in Schuyler's arms.  Schuyler is ultra-careful, over-
     whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny BROTHER (DAVID).

     4. THE BOY and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic
     show in the front GARDEN-- a MAGICIAN waves a colored handkerchief,
     a DOVE FLIES OUT.  CAMERA FOLLOWS the bird UP toward the house...

     5. THE CAMERA FINDS MR. VAN ORTON, a pinched, depressive man of
     about 40, wearing glasses.  He stands on a high balcony at the top
     story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette.  The
     unseen photographer ZOOMS IN jerkily on the man.  When he realizes
     he's being photographed, Mr. Van Orton turns his back and goes
     inside the house.  The film SOLARIZES and runs into LEADER--

                                                       CUT TO:

     6.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (PRESENT DAY)

     TITLES CONTINUE.  Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an
     ornate Victorian or Arts & Crafts).  The landscaping has changed,
     there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the
     carriageway, a black 500-class MERCEDES in the drive.

     MUSIC DOWN, SEGUE to a CNN NEWS BROADCAST OVER as the CAMERA MOVES
     IN ON THE UPPER BALCONY where we'd seen Mr. Van Orton earlier...
     it's now COVERED and GLASSED-IN.  We move THROUGH THE GLASS...

     7.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B E D R O O M  -  D A Y 

     TRACK THROUGH a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan,
     free weights, a treadmill.  Atop the bed a LAPTOP COMPUTER runs
     STOCK QUOTES.  A LARGE-SCREEN TV plays UNWATCHED, a familiar CNN
     ANCHOR (we'll assume BERNARD SHAW).  The Bang & Olufsen CLOCK RADIO
     CLICKS ON, 6:30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with the TV report.
     HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT TABLE,
     where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony. 

     END TITLES as we MOVE TOWARD a DOOR, it's open a crack-- from this
     adjacent bath we hear the SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING...

     8.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B A T H R O O M  -  D A Y 

     In the steam-filled bathroom, we make out SCHUYLER VAN ORTON, now
     38.  He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his
     world.  He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself
     and grabs the BATHROOM PHONE. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     Van Orton... Yes, it is my 
                     birthday, Bob, is that why you
                     called...?  Ah... No, I'm not 
                     carrying Alan Baer another inch, 
                     fuck him, BG Lumber is history... 

     As he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, Q-
     tips, etc.  (Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.) 

     9.  E X T.   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T S  -  D A Y 

     The black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic.

     10.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER is on his car phone, NEWS RADIO LOW in BG, maneuvering 
     aggressively through traffic.  His laptop RUNS in the passenger
     seat, its cellular antenna up. 

                             SCHUYLER (on carphone) 
                     Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know
                     me, of course I'm behind Baer- 
                     Grace a hundred per cent... great,
                     see you at the shareholders'
                     meeting next month... 

     He hangs up and HONKS at another driver, displaying no emotion.

     11.  I N T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 

     TRACK WITH SCHUYLER through an elegant suite of offices.  He passes
     a discreet sign: "THE VAN ORTON GROUP."  Schuyler is on a cell-
     phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by MARIA, his middle-aged
     secretary.  She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention. 

                             SCHUYLER (on cellphone) 
                     I've got buyers for the BG paper mill,
                     goose the lawyers, final papers in 
                     three weeks... sure it's sad, but an
                     old dog loses its teeth and pisses
                     itself, you put it to sleep... 

     As Schuyler walks, he's GREETED by passing UNDERLINGS, whom he
     ignores.  He SHUTS OFF the phone, Maria hands him a couple of
     items, follows him into his office. 

                             MARIA 
                     Carol from the museum called. 
                     She's sending architect's sketches
                     of the wing...

     12.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y 

     The office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money.  A window
     overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay. 

                             MARIA 
                     That Business Week reporter called again-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Tell him to fuck himself.  Nicely. 

                             MARIA 
                           (awkwardly) 
                     --and, um, somebody who identified
                     himself as, um, P.P. Willy. 

     SCHUYLER FREEZES at this, stares at her. 

                             MARIA 
                     Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but
                     he swore you'd know who he was.  He 
                     wanted to meet you for lunch, I told
                     him you had appointments all-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Cancel.  Cancel the whole afternoon. 

                             MARIA
                     But you-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Do it.  Did he leave a number? 

                             MARIA
                     No.  He just said he'd be at Leo's
                     in the Haight.  At noon. 

     Maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     That's all, Maria. 

     She heads out quickly.  Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to
     look out the window, lost in thought. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     13.  I N T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 

     A working class bar, an ALCOHOLIC or two, pinball machines. 
     SCHUYLER sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not
     his kind of place.  A WAITRESS arrives in a too-small uniform--
     young, multiple earrings, CHRISTINE according to her name tag. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Can I take your order? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I haven't seen the menu. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Oh, right.  Here, see ya. 

     She hands him a menu and starts off.  Schuyler calls after her. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     An iced tea, please-- 

     She waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back.  Schuyler 
     sighs and opens the menu.  Suddenly, someone BACKHANDS the side of
     his skull, he assumes a defensive posture.  Schuyler sees his
     LAUGHING brother:  DAVID VAN ORTON. 

                             DAVID 
                     Yo, Sky.  Happy birthday. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                       (rubs his head, annoyed) 
                     Thanks, "Pee-pee."  I never get
                     tired of that. 

     DAVID slides into the seat opposite him.  He's in his early 30's,
     good-looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring
     and a perpetual grin.  There's an intense, edgy quality to him
     which Schuyler has some trouble readjusting to. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Well... long time. 

                             DAVID 
                     Yeah, since Mom died-- what, five
                     years? So how you been? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Business as usual... 

                             DAVID 
                     How's Elizabeth?  Any kids? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     A little girl. 

                             DAVID
                     Congrat-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It's not mine, she married a
                     pediatrician in Sausalito. 

                             DAVID 
                     You're divorced... 
                        (off Schuyler's nod) 
                     Too bad, she was actually interesting. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     She stopped drinking, I guess 
                     getting rid of me was the 13th step. 

                             DAVID 
                     So you're all alone in the House of Pain. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I redecorated.  Where have you been? 

                             DAVID 
                     All over.  Nowhere in particular.
                     Didn't your fucking gumshoes keep 
                     you informed of my every movement? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I called them off two years ago, 
                     David.  You'd kicked the heroin, you'd
                     left the ashram, you were windsurfing
                     somewhere in Central America...

                             DAVID 
                     It's gorgeous down there... you
                     should go sometime. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, are you in trouble, is there
                     anything you need?  You can't have
                     gone through the trust fund... 

                             DAVID 
                         (looks at him, hurt) 
                     That's not why I'm here, Sky, I
                     just wanted to see you... I even
                     brought a gift, for a change. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You didn't bake me a cake, did you?

                             DAVID 
                     You can't still be mad about the
                     hash brownies... 

     Schuyler's unamused by the memory.  David grins and pulls a small
     envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him. 

                             DAVID 
                     Happy birthday, bro. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What is this. 

                             DAVID
                     It's a bomb.  Open it! 

     Schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out-- 

     A BUSINESS CARD in BLUE and ORANGE:  "CONSUMER RECREATION SERVICES." 
     The C, R and S are HIGHLIGHTED, a PHONE NUMBER at the bottom.

     SCHUYLER picks up the card, fingers it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Consumer Recreation Services.  OK...

                             DAVID 
                     I can't tell you very much about it,
                     that'd ruin the surprise.  Just 
                     promise me you'll give 'em a call. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't get it. 

                             DAVID 
                     Just call 'em.  OK look, it's simple,
                     really.  They entertain you. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Is this an escort service? 

                             DAVID 
                     No, it's nothing like that. 
                     They're a business, they're for
                     real... They guarantee just one
                     thing-- you won't be bored. 

     Schuyler gives him a bored, blank look.  David throws up his hands.

                             DAVID 
                     They make your life fun. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fun. 

                             DAVID 
                     You've heard of it. 

     Christine the waitress has shown up with Schuyler's iced tea.  She
     puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table.  Schuyler
     shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip
     into his lap.  Cracking gum: 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Sorry. 

     She moves off as Schuyler tries to order, raising a finger--

                             SCHUYLER
                     Just a cheesebur... how'd you find
                     this place?

                             DAVID 
                     Old connection used to meet me
                     here.  So you gonna call 'em? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (a sigh, carefully) 
                     You know, David, this is sweet, but 
                     it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the
                     midst of a delicate liquidation-- 

                             DAVID 
                       (mimicking him bitterly) 
                     "A delicate liquidation," God, you
                     would do this... 

                             SCHUYLER
                     David-- 

                             DAVID 
                     We can't get together once without 
                     you making me feel like shit.  That's
                     important to you, isn't it? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What are you talking about? 

                             DAVID 
                     Forget about it, don't bother. 

     David slumps in his seat, won't meet Schuyler's eyes. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Are you still on medication...? 

     David glares at him.  With the impeccable timing of all waitresses,
     CHRISTINE appears, chipper. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You guys know what you want? 

                             DAVID
                     Go away. 

     She curls her lip and departs before Schuyler can open his mouth.
     He sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating.  Calmly:

                             DAVID 
                     I just thought you'd like it.  I did,
                     it was a blast, best thing that ever
                     happened to me.  And for your 
                     information, I'm not on anything
                     anymore, I'm not even seeing a 
                     shrink, I'm in a better place than 
                     I've ever been, I'm even happy-- but
                     that's something else I wouldn't be
                     able to explain to you. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     OK, OK, I'll give them a call... 

                             DAVID

                     Look, take a pill.  Just be normal 
                     for thirty seconds and tell me what
                     this is.  I hate surprises.

                             SCHUYLER
                     Van Orton. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     Hello, Schuyler. 

     ELIZABETH is Schuyler's ex-wife-- an earnest woman, a stranger to
     subtlety.  STAY WITH SCHUYLER, who half-smiles, looks at his watch. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Eleven forty, you almost didn't
                     make it. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     I always call on your birthday.
                     How was it? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh, the usual, big party, circus
                     clowns, naked lady in a cake... 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                       (slight chuckle; serious)
                     How are you, Sky? 

     She has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person,"
     someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out.
     Schuyler GRIMACES, then mimics the tone: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm just fine.  How are you? 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     It wasn't a trick question. 
                     Thirty-eight, I thought that might
                     be a-- a difficult year for you... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Hm?  Just another birthday, 
                     another year closer to death. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     I meant-- because of your father. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh that's right, I guess he was 38,
                     wasn't he?  I hadn't thought about 
                     it, to tell the truth, but thank you
                     for the reminder. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     Why do I call you... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I honestly don't know, but it's a
                     nice change of pace from talking
                     to your attorneys.  So, still
                     working at the hospice? 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     Mm-hmm, couple days a week... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Great, that's great.  Well, give my
                     regards to Dr. Mel and the baby-- 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     She has a little brother on the 
                     way... we just did the ultrasound. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Really.  Congratulations-- two 
                     kids, an official nuclear family,
                     you must be very happy. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     We are, Sky.  Very happy. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Well, you deserved someone who 
                     wanted the same things you did-- 

                             ELIZABETH
                     Are you?  Happy? 

     SCHUYLER hates this question.  He quickly changes the subject. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Speaking of little brothers, I saw
                     David today. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     Really? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     He asked about you.  He's on a new 
                     kick, some personal improvement cult.
                     I'm gonna check it out, I'm sure he's
                     getting fleeced again. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     Who knows, maybe it'll be good for 
                     you.  Send David my love. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Right.  Well, thanks again for
                     calling, Elizabeth, take care. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     You too, Schuyler-- I mean that-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mm, good luck, bye. 

     He PUNCHES off the phone in the middle of her "Good-bye."  Schuyler
     returns to his work, as if the call hadn't taken place-- but a few
     seconds later, we see his concentration is completely shattered, he
     leans back in his SQUEAKING deskchair.

     A LIMOUSINE pulls into the ungated carriageway.  THE BACK DOOR 
     OPENS and SCHUYLER (7) emerges from the backseat, carrying 
     elementary schoolbooks.  As he approaches the front steps, he looks
     upward at something, blinks and squints. 

     ANGLE UP-- MR. VAN ORTON, in his robe, stands on the balcony 
     railing, looking up at the sky.  He turns his gaze slowly downward. 

     YOUNG SCHUYLER is puzzled, gives his dad a tentative wave.

     MR. VAN ORTON waves back, his eyes dead, expression blank. 

     YOUNG SCHUYLER opens his mouth to call to his father-- instead we
     hear an URGENT ELECTRONIC BEEPING--

     A MICROWAVE OVEN BEEPS that the meal is "READY."  SCHUYLER opens

     ON A BIG-SCREEN TV, a CNN NEWSCAST shows a FIRE OUT OF CONTROL.
     MOVE FROM THIS through the manly, book-lined den.  The house is
     traditional, opulent, densely decorated with "good pieces"-- and it
     feels like a mausoleum. 

     FIND SCHUYLER peeling open the plastic food container.  He sits in
     a leather armchair.  A BOTTLE OF DOM PERIGNON sits on the coffee
     table, near a champagne flute glass, a CUPCAKE with a CANDLE in it.
     The LAPTOP computer is RUNNING.

     ON TV, BERNARD SHAW comes out of the story.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'll drink to that. 

     SCHUYLER raises his champagne glass to the TV, his birthday done.
     Then he toasts in the direction of a FRAMED PICTURE on the coffee
     table-- a WEDDING PHOTO OF SCHUYLER and ELIZABETH. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (TV)

                     For all of us here at CNN, thank
                     you for watching-- 

     SCHUYLER reaches for the REMOTE CONTROL.  He settles back on the
     sofa, CHANNEL HOPPING.  He despairs of this quickly, points the
     remote at his own head-- CLICK, CLICK.  He closes his eyes. 

     24.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (FLASHBACK) 

     MR. VAN ORTON stands on the edge of the balcony, waving as before.
     He looks skyward one last time, then suddenly LAUNCHES HIMSELF INTO
     SPACE in a head-first dive.  We hear what sounds like a SCREAM--

     toward a postmodern building in the financial district; a ramp 
     leads to a parking garage beneath.  Casually dressed, he glances up
     at the facade for a few moments, then goes in.

     minor construction underway on the ground floor, scaffolding about.
     Schuyler crosses to a bank of lobby elevators.

     Partitioned work areas, terminals, clutter and disarray.  Office
     doors open off a reception area.  CRS EMPLOYEES move about
     hectically.  Schuyler enters, wanders about for a moment, confused.
     A friendly female RECEPTIONIST glances up from her desk. 

                             RECEPTIONIST
                     Can I help you? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Is this Consumer Recreation
                     Services?  I have an appointment, 
                     the name's Van Orton. 

     The woman flips through an appointment book with a logo, CRS.  IN
     BG, JIM FEINGOLD pays a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY for a BAG OF FOOD. 

                             RECEPTIONIST 
                     Hm... I don't seem to-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Schuyler Van Orton, I called last week. 

     The woman shakes her head.  FEINGOLD slows as he crosses past
     Schuyler, carrying the bag.  He's 30-40, a no-nonsense engineer,
     looks a bit dull, but he exudes competence and trustworthiness. 

                             FEINGOLD
                     Problem? 

                             RECEPTIONIST 
                     This gentlemen says he has an
                     appointment, but... 

     Feingold glances at Schuyler, shrugs. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Van Orton, huh?  I'll take him.
                        (shakes his hand) 
                     Jim Feingold, v. p. in charge of
                     engineering and data analysis. 

     The man leads Schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor, looks
     in a couple, then finds what he's after.  He snatches up a couple 
     of pages, hands them to Schuyler.  Then he finds a clipboard on the
     floor, tosses it to him like a frisbee. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Sorry about the chaos, we're still
                     in the process of moving...
                     follow me, I've got an office
                     around here someplace. 

     He reaches into a box of PENS, passes one to Schuyler.

     CLOSE ON PEN-- the CRS LOGO.

     very cool-looking.  Feingold moves behind the desk, unpacks a
     couple of white cartons. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     I can't remember the last time I ate
                     in a restaurant, all I do is work... 

     SCHUYLER sits on a couch, looking at the forms. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I know what you mean.  Look-- what
                     is all this? 

     The fast-talking Feingold moves energetically through the office,
     occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with 
     chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Application, MMPI and TAT tests,

                     The tests serve a threefold purpose.
                     First off, are you right for us? 
                     Are we right for you?  Unfortunately,
                     there's a limited number of slots-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Let's back up here-- 

                             FEINGOLD 
                            (over him) 
                     B, we need an idea of your abilities
                     and limitations, what turns you on, 
                     and off.  Numero tres, our insurance
                     company requires it. 
                        (a beat, studying Schuyler) 
                     You're familiar with our service,
                     aren't you? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Not at all.  What are you selling? 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Well... it's a game. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     A game. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Recharges the batteries, gets you
                     off the treadmill, it's an 
                     experience.  Sort of a-- vacation 
                     for the guy who's been everywhere. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This really doesn't sound like my
                     sort of-- 

     Feingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and
     smiling condescendingly-- he raises a hand to stop Schuyler. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What's so amusing? 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Nothing.  I know who you are. 
                     You're David Van Orton's brother,
                     he got you in here. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     So. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                       (remembering fondly) 
                     David was-- impressive, one of the
                     better I've seen.  But frankly, I
                     can see you're not the type.

                             SCHUYLER
                     The type. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     You know, a player. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm not a player. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     I don't mean anything personal by it--
                     I know you're an important guy, 
                     powerful guy, you're used to being on
                     top.  It's just, this isn't for 
                     everyone.  Not everyone can handle it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                       (nearly losing it) 
                     What kind of fu-- game is this? 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     The ultimate fucking game.  I wish I
                     could tell you more, but it's
                     different every time.
                             (rising) 
                     Thanks for coming in-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (doesn't move) 
                     I'm not an idiot.  I see what you're 
                     doing.  First the vague yet intriguing
                     pitch, then I'm supposed to feel like
                     my manhood's in question because I'm
                     not up for, what, some motivational
                     role-playing fantasy nonsense-- 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Interesting, you don't know the first
                     thing about it but you've already
                     decided what it is... Listen, I
                     don't wanna waste any more-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get
                     shit.  I've got the afternoon 
                     free, I'll take your silly tests.

     Feingold cocks his head, reappraising him.  Then, with a smile, he
     calls to an attractive young WOMAN passing in the hall; Schuyler,
     meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Ms. Nelson, are you busy?  We need
                     someone to run Mr. Van Orton. 

                             MS. NELSON
                     This way, sir... 

     As she leads Schuyler out the door, Feingold WINKS at him. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     I'll catch up with you after the physical. 

     Schuyler reacts-- a physical?  He throws up a hand and follows the
     woman into the hall.  Alone now, Feingold cracks a fortune cookie
     and glances at the slip of paper inside.  He furrows his brow with
     concern at the fortune-- then tosses it aside.

                                                       CUT TO:

     30. CRS OFFICES - SERIES OF SHOTS

     During the following QUICK CUTS, SOUNDS will be layered in and
     CONTINUE over one another, e. g. the SOUND of a scraping pencil,
     the BLIPS of machinery, HEAVY BREATHING, MURMURING VOICES of
     TECHNICIANS giving instructions...

     A. X-CLOSE:  A #2 pencil FILLS IN box after box on a long MMPI 
     form.  CLOSE on a couple of these:  "I sometimes hurt animals... I
     feel guilty when I masturbate..." each followed by TRUE and FALSE
     boxes. 

     B. A WHITE-WALLED ROOM:  Schuyler concentrates on a drawing held by
     a stone-faced PSYCHOLOGIST, a TAT test; he laughs as he speaks into
     a tape-recorder, analyzing the pictures. 

     C. X-CLOSE:  The DRAWING, a large ant with an apron feeding a TV
     dinner to a human child.  The card moves just as we register it to
     reveal another DRAWING of a smiling man toppling backwards in a
     chair, perched on the edge of a cliff. 

     D. A LAB:  Electronic MONITORS and PRINTERS record Schuyler's EEG
     and EKG.  We see him on a doctor's table, wearing a medical gown
     with the CRS logo.  He's hooked up to the wires, a female
     TECHNICIAN studying the readouts while a NURSE takes his blood
     pressure. 

     E. X-CLOSE:  The traveling trace of intersecting colored waves. 

     F. A DARKENED ROOM:  Schuyler in FG, still in the gown, watches a
     screen as images FLASH-- geometric SHAPES, WORDS, PHOTOS.  His
     finger hovers over a bank of three buttons, he presses different
     ones from time to time.  There's a MIRROR to one side of the room-- 

     G. X-CLOSE:  A COMPUTER SCREEN shows green columns of NUMBERS--
     SCHUYLER'S NAME is steady at the top of the screen, with an account
     number.  CAMERA MOVES FROM THE SCREEN to show an unseen COMPUTER
     OPERATOR watching Schuyler through the one-way glass. 

     The CACOPHONY of the MONTAGE ends abruptly as we CUT TO:

     31.  I N T .   C U B I C L E  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler, in the gown, sits on an examination table with his hands
     in his lap in a small, featureless cubicle-- he seems vulnerable, 
     looks around blankly.  To himself, irritated and bemused: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     David, you suck. 

     FEINGOLD BURSTS IN, a slew of COMPUTER PRINT-OUTS under his arm. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Sorry to keep you waiting, 
                     a client's head exploded...
                             (grins) 
                     You can get dressed, we're done. 

     He throws open a closet door.  Schuyler reaches inside for his
     clothes, which are neatly folded and on hangers.  Feingold turns
     his back on him as he DRESSES, perching on the examination table
     and studying the unburst print-outs. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Looks promising at this point. 
                     You test well, you're in decent
                     shape for someone in your tax 
                     bracket... Hm, some resistance to
                     the psych questions, but we got 
                     the general idea... 

     He heads out, beckons for Schuyler to follow. 

     32.  I N T .   C R S   M A I N   F L O O R  -  N I G H T 

     Feingold leads him through the office-- SECRETARIES and other 
     WORKERS pack up at the end of the day. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     We design the game around your 
                     schedule, you're free to give it
                     as much or as little time as you 
                     wish.  And of course, you can call
                     it quits at any point. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This was actually a gift.  Did my
                     brother pay in advance? 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     You'd have to ask our billing 
                     department... the price varies.  But
                     our service comes with a guarantee.
                     If you're not satisfied, there's no 
                     charge.  And we've never had an
                     unsatisfied customer... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You mean dissatisfied. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                        (looking at a form) 
                     Mm, that's right-- you're a left-
                     brain word fetishist. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I get that all the time. 

     Feingold smiles tightly and leads Schuyler back into his office.

     33.  I N T .   F E I N G O L D ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y 

     CLOSE ON PAPERWORK as it's dropped on the desktop. 

     SCHUYLER, CRS pen in hand, looks at this dubiously.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     So I'm supposed to sign up for a 
                     game when I don't know the rules,
                     I don't know the object, I don't
                     know how much it costs... 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     It's a leap of faith.  But at this
                     stage, there's no commitment-- we
                     just need to process your 
                     application.  And if you qualify,
                     you're in for the ride of your 
                     life.  What have you got to lose? 

     Schuyler CLICKS the ballpoint pen, they both lean over the papers. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Initials-- initials-- sign here. 

     Schuyler's about to sign when Feingold grabs his wrist. 

                             FEINGOLD
                     In blood. 
                             (a WINK)
                     ---Just kidding. 

     CLOSE, as Schuyler SIGNS on the dotted line. 

     FEINGOLD snatches up the forms, suddenly seems in a hurry for
     Schuyler to go. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Very good, Mr. Van Orton.  Please,
                     keep the pen. 

     Schuyler shrugs, sticks it in his breast pocket, starts out. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     When can I expect to hear-- 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     We'll be in touch. 

     Feingold gently shuts the door on schuyler's face.

     S C E N E   3 4   D E L E T E D 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     35(NEW).  I N T .   R A C Q U E T B A L L   C O U R T / C O R R I D O R  -  D A Y

     WHAM, a BALL SLAMS against a wall. 

     THROUGH A WINDOW, we see SCHUYLER playing violently, pumping 
     sweat... he's alone.  We hear the sound of a PHONE CALL OVER: 

                             SCHUYLER (V. O.) 
                     David, where the hell are you, we 
                     were supposed to meet at the club-- 

                             DAVID (V. O.) 
                     Oh, shit, sorry Sky, I spaced--
                     next Tuesday?

                             SCHUYLER (V. O.)
                     I'll be in Seattle. 

                             DAVID (V. O.) 
                     Buy you lunch soon as you get
                     back, I swear... 

     Fed up with playing alone, Schuyler lets the ball bounce, exits the
     court and heads for a LOCKER ROOM down the hall...

                             SCHUYLER (V. O.) 
                     I checked out CRS by the way-- 

                             DAVID (V. O.) 
                     Hey, great, you gonna go for it? 

                             SCHUYLER (V. O.)
                     Haven't decided yet...

     S C E N E   3 6   D E L E T E D 

     37(NEW).  E X T .   C O U N T R Y   C L U B   B A R  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER, in casual clothes, hair still wet from a shower, comes 
     out of a locker room area toward an outdoor BAR by a SWIMMING POOL
     at this upscale country ciub.  He passes PETE and JOHN, two middle- 
     aged RICH MEN sitting at a table near the bar; he overhears a
     snippet of their conversation-- 

                             JOHN 
                     --like fuckin' wildfire, just 
                     opened an office in Frisco here-- 

                             PETE 
                     I played my game in New York...
                     What do you think John, will CRS
                     ever go public? 

                             JOHN 
                           (laughs) 
                     Not likely, would you? 

     Schuyler slows down, eavesdropping, then moves toward the bar,
     addresses the BARTENDER with a nod toward John and Pete. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     New members? 

                             BARTENDER
                     I believe so. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This round's on me. 

     Schuyler moves casually toward the men--

                                                  DISSOLVE TO: 

     38(N). SAME LOCATION, LATER, the bartender brings another round of
     drinks to the table, Schuyler and the men have been chatting a 
     while, all seem relaxed.  Pete, the friendlier (drunker) of the
     two, puffs a CIGAR as he speaks: 

                             PETE 
                     ...last time I played Pebble, I swore
                     I'd never pick up a club again... 

     The others CHUCKLE knowingly.  Schuyler sips his drink, blinking
     and coughing discretely at the smoke; there's a slight pause. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Great thing about golf, the way it
                     takes you out of your life...
                     Speaking of games-- I take it you
                     two are familiar with CRS...? 

                             JOHN 
                     Uh-oh.  Time to piss... 

     He slides off his stool.  Pete studies Schuyler, sizing him up. 

                             PETE 
                     Why do you ask, Schuyler? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I couldn't help overhearing-- 

                             PETE 
                     We don't usually talk about it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I only bring it up because, well,
                     I recently tested for it. 

                             PETE 
                     Did you?  Kudos. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I just wasn't sure if they're for
                     real, whether it's worth it-- 

                             PETE 
                     Worth it... Gee, I dunno... they did
                     save my fucking life... 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Sorry? 

                             PETE 
                     Look, I don't know you, you don't know
                     me, but... I hit a certain point, 
                     nothing meant anything.  My work, the
                     wife and kids-- hell with 'em, I was 
                     sick of it all, y'know?  But CRS... they
                     changed everything.  "Are they for 
                     real?"  Who cares, maybe nothing is.
                        (raises his glass)
                     To reality. 

     Schuyler raises his glass, numbed by this outpouring.  Pete drains
     his drink, chuckling to himself.  His friend comes back, looking
     concerned, takes the man's arm. 

                             JOHN
                     C'mon Pete. 

                             PETE 
                       (winks at Schuyler) 
                     Good luck, pal.  You'll need it. 

     Schuyler stares after the two men dubiously as they move off.

                                                       CUT TO:

     39.  I N T .   L A W   F I R M   C O N F E R E N C E   R O O M  -  D A Y 

     A slick, designery conference room, filled with BABBLING LAWYERS-- 
     at the head of the table stands BOB PLYMPTON, a trustworthy man in
     his late 50's.  MURMURING CONTINUES during Plympton's address. 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Postponing
                     the Baer-Grace meeting is out of 
                     the question.  Schuyler gets on a
                     plane for Washington tomorrow
                     morning at seven with every 
                     contract, every side agreement, 
                     the complete closing package!

     Schuyler has been going through paperwork in the back of the room,
     he steps forward during the above. 

                             LAWYER 
                     But there's simply no-- 

     THWAP!  Schuyler DROPS the stack of papers on the table, SILENCE. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No is not an option.  If you fail
                     to recognize that, I'll find ten
                     other law firms in the yellow 
                     pages that can get the job done-- 

     CHIRP.  Schuyler's CELL-PHONE has started RINGING during the above.
     He finally removes it from his pocket and moves to a quiet corner. 

                             SCHUYLER
                           (impatient) 
                     Yes. 

     QUIET COMMOTION resumes IN BG during the following.  On the other
     end of the line, there's the bland, bureaucratic VOICE of CYNTHIA:

                             CYNTHIA (filter)
                     Mr. Van Orton? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yes, who is this? 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     This is Cynthia at CRS... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What?!  How did you get this number? 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     I'm just calling to inform you
                     that we've finished processing
                     your application-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm in a meeting-- 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     --and I'm afraid you didn't qualify. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     --so I don't have time for--
                       (beat, then quickly) 
                     Excuse me, what was that? 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     Well... your application was rejected. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     ...Why? 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     Oh, I'm afraid I don't have that 
                     information, but-- many applicants
                     don't meet the criteria.  We
                     apologize, we hope it hasn't 
                     caused you any inconvenience-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     This is absurd-- 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     Thank you for thinking of CRS. 

     CLICK and a DIAL TONE.  Schuyler shuts the phone and replaces it in
     his pocket, his mind suddenly far away from the meeting at hand.
     PLYMPTON, a wel1-meaning man with a fatherly attitude toward
     Schuyler, steps close to him and speaks quietly, concerned: 

                             PLYMPTON
                     Bad news, Sky? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, nothing.  Sorry, Bob.
                        (loudly, to boardroom) 
                     So were there any more questions, or
                     may I assume it's under control... 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     40.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER pulls up in his MBZ, the electric gate glides shut.  He
     gets out of the car and SETS THE ALARM.  He heads for the front
     steps of his home-- then freezes, blinks-- 

     ON HIS DOORSTEP lies a body, face-down, apparently a WINO, in a
     tattered, filthy overcoat. 

                                                  FLASH CUT TO:

     41.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (FLASHBACK) 

     SAME ANGLE, QUICK SHOT of the body of MR. VAN ORTON, sprawled 
     across the steps in much the same position as the wino, flat on his 
     stomach, head twisted at a grotesque angle.  His bathrobe is even
     similar in color to the wino's overcoac. 

                                                  CUT BACK TO:

     42.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER shakes off the memory, looking alarmed.  He calls out:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Hello!  What are you doing here? 

     THE BODY doesn't stir.  He approaches gingerly.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wonderful.  You OK?  You dead? 

     He crouches by the wino, winces at a strong smell, covers his nose.
     He reaches out to touch the body, but hesitates, pulls back.  Alive
     or dead, he doesn't want to have anything to do with this person. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Shit, shit, shit...

     The "wino" suddenly SPRINGS UP like a jack-in-the-box, bending
     backwards impossibly at the hips.  Schuyler lets out a CRY and 
     scrambles back toward his car.

     THE HEAD swivels to face him-- it's a grotesque HARLEQUIN, its head
     made of COLORED GLASS, LIT from within.  The MOUTH DROPS OPEN and a 
     tongue in the shape of a corkscrew SPRINGS OUT. 

     A SMALL KEY ON A HOOK dangles from the tip of the tongue.  One of
     the harlequin's glass eyes WINKS. 

     SCHUYLER stares in amazement for a few moments. 

     CLOSE on the dangling KEY as Schuyler fingers it.  The key catches
     the light and we see the letters "CRS" embossed on it. 

     42B(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  N I G H T 

     THE DUMMY is dumped in a straight-back chair in the foyer. 

     SCHUYLER takes a step back and studies it.  He crosses its legs,
     smirks and shakes his head, ascending the stairs. 

     CLOSE ON the disturbing empty stare of the DUMMY...

                                                       CUT TO: 

     43.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   B A T H R O O M / B E D R O O M  -  N I G H T 

     CLOSE ON SCHUYLER'S EYE as he blinks and removes a CONTACT LENS.  A
     NEWSCAST is barely audible in BG. 

     WIDER, Schuyler, squinting, in a bathrobe, enters from the bathroom
     off the bedroom, putting his contact lens case into a toiletries
     case.  He's been packing a leather GARMENT BAG, which hangs from a
     door, slips the toiletries into a "side pouch.  The TV PLAYS in BG,
     Bernard Shaw delivering the news. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (on TV) 
                     ...the bill goes before the House
                     next week, where it's expected to
                     meet stiff opposition-- 
                         (beat, touches his ear)
                     Wait, this just in... 

     This gets Schuyler's attention, he squints toward the television. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)
                     The U. S. geological service has 
                     detected a massive disturbance in the 
                     earth's crust deep beneath the northern
                     segment of the San Andreas fault... 

     SCHUYLER scrambles for his glasses, as Shaw struggles to continue. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) 
                     ...they have issued a warning that a
                     major earthquake of magnitude eight
                     or greater is likely to hit the San
                     Francisco Bay area within...
                             (a beat) 
                     Oh my God, the next fifteen minutes-- 

     SCHUYLER sits on the bed, breathes hard, stares at the tube. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)
                     There is no time for an evacuation.
                     The federal government has issued 
                     the following instructions for all
                     residents of central and northern
                     California... 

     SCHUYLER is freaking out, paces frantically, moves toward a phone--
     who's he going to call?  He makes a low MOAN. 

     SHAW'S voice CRACKS, he speaks very rapidly. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)
                     Locate emergency shut-offs for all
                     power and gas-- 

     SCHUYLER starts moving out of the room-- 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) 
                     Wait, there's no time for that-- just
                     stay away from windows and doors-- 

     SCHUYLER doubles back, avoiding a window, his panic mounting-- 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) 
                     Find a heavy piece of furniture such as
                     a desk or table and get under it-- 

     SCHUYLER looks around, sees no such appropriate spot in the room. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV)
                     If no such furniture is immediately
                     available, go to a window or doorway-- 

     SCHUYLER blinks, hesitates starts to move toward the doar-- 

                             BERNARD sHAW (cant., on TV) 
                     But first turn off all power and gas.
                     Crouch in a comfortable position, put 
                     your head between your knees and cover
                     it with your arms-- 

     SCHUYLER, confused, crouches as instructed--

                             BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) 
                     Then KISS YOUR LILY-WHITE ASS GOODBYE! 

     On this last line, Shaw's voice starts to ECHO and CHANGE.

     SCHUYLER rises, staring at the TV, mouth agape.

     SHAW WINKS.  His VOICE is utterly transformed.

                             BERNARD SHAW (on TV) 
                     Howdy Sky. 

     HIS FACE RIPPLES and MORPHS into a SKULL, it's becoming clear that
     this is a computer-generated Bernard shaw. 

                             CYBERSHAW (on TV)
                     Que pasa? 

     As CYBERSHAW speaks, his face will continue to transform, sometimes
     back to a recognizable human state, other times into abstract
     images, a talking piano, a dog, etc. 

                             CYBERSHAW (on TV)
                     Welcome to the Game! 
                     Congratulations on your decision
                     to let Consumer Recreation
                     Services entertain you. 

     The combination of relief, amazement and anger is a bit much for
     Schuyler to absorb.  Smiling sickly: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Fuckers! 

                             CYBERSHAW (on TV) 
                     This might be a good time to lay out
                     a few ground rules, help you enjoy 
                     your adventure.  You've received the
                     first key.  There will be others. 
                     Pay attention-- you never know where
                     you'll find 'em, you never know when
                     you'll need 'em, so keep 'em with
                     you at all times... 

     As he speaks, Schuyler reaches for the gold key on his bedside
     table.  He starts putting it onto his keychain. 

     ON TV SCREEN-- below CyberShaw, a PHONE NUMBER SCROLLS PAST. 

                             CYBERSHAW (on TV) 
                     You might want to write this number 
                     down, it's the CRS hotline, operators
                     are standing by to assist... but 
                     please don't call to ask what the 
                     object of the game is-- figuring that
                     out is the object of the game...

     SCHUYLER has snatched up the CRS pen to write down the number-- it
     doesn't work.  SWEARING, he tosses it aside, grabs another. 

     ON TV, CyberShaw MORPHS back into the original Bernard Shaw. 
     There's a quick VISUAL GLITCH on the tube as the original TV feed
     resumes-- Bernard Shaw is delivering a normal news story. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (on TV) 
                     --reaction on wall Street was muted 
                     following the Fed's announcement of... 

     SCHUYLER is taken with the display of electronic pyrotechnics, in
     spite of himself.  He hits the speaker button on his phone, dials. 

                             OPERATOR VOICE (filter)
                     You've reached CRS... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yeah, this is pretty impressive 
                     but listen-- 

                             OPERATOR VOICE (filter) 
                     Our office is closed.  Please call

                              (BEEP) 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     My name is Schuyler Van Orton, my 
                     game just started.  Look, this is a
                     bad time, I'm about to leave town-- 

     A DIAL TONE, CRS doesn't take messages.  Schuyler sighs, HANGS UP. 

     44.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER crouches by a coaxial cable line emerging from the side of
     the house.  He fingers a box with a miniature LOOP and RABBIT EAR
     ANTENNA that's been spliced into the line with a tiny S-shaped 
     WIRE.  He starts to unscrew it, then thinks twice, heads back in. 

     WIDER, as Schuyler enters his mansion, a GIBBOUS MOON OVERHEAD.

                                                       CUT TO:

     45.  E X T .   S E A - T A C   A I R P O R T  -  D A Y

     Mist in the air, a jet taxis to a terminal. 

     46.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER comes out of the gate with the garment bag and a 
     briefcase.  He joins up with a DRIVER carrying a sign that says VAN
     ORTON, the man takes his bag for him. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm expecting a package with some
                     documents.  Did it arrive? 

     The man shakes his head, Schuyler, exasperated, whips out his cell-
     phone and dials.  As he and the driver move through the CROWD, they
     pass a red-eyed, dredlocked, homeless-looking RASTA MAN in a 
     BRIGHTLY COLORED outfit with knit cap, hassling other TRAVELERS.
     He turns his attention to Schuyler and begins walking alongside. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Ay mon, got sometin' fo you mon. 

                             DRIVER 
                         (to the rasta)
                     Get lost, pal. 

                             RASTA MAN
                     No can do. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     Bob, it's Sky, what the hell is 
                     going on?  No, the papers aren't 
                     here, you'll have to fax signature
                     copies straight to the BG offices
                     now.  Yeah I'll hold. 

     The driver and Schuyler climb into a little white people mover 
     cart, the driver starts forward, BEEPING at folks in the way.  The
     rasta man continues to badger Schuyler. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     You want what I got, mon. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (hand over the phone)
                     No thank you. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Dere are many paths to 
                     enlightenment, but you must choose
                     one and stay on it-- or you will
                     surely die in the darkness-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'll take my chances.

     The rasta man jogs alongside, holds up a stained, newsprint
     religious TRACT, Schuyler glances at it without taking it-- 

     CLOSE-- we see the words "CRISIS, REVELATION, SOLUTION."  The
     letters C, Rand S are printed in a different color from the rest. 

     WIDER-- Schuyler ignores the tract, he's talking to Bob again on
     the phone.  The driver SPEEDS UP as they pass a guard, entering a
     restricted access area. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     What?!  Fire their asses, that's it. 

     The Rasta Man runs out of breath as the cart SPEEDS UP.  He calls
     after Schuyler:

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Jah Love mon, dat's the key, dat's the key... 

     47.  E X T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  D A Y 

     Cold and bleak.  The little white truck emerges from the terminal,
     crosses the tarmac, heading toward an IDLING HELICOPTER, where is
     stops.  From the chopper, ALAN BAER emerges-- he's an elderly,
     muscular man, bluff, once blue-collar.  He gives Schuyler a firm
     handshake.  They have to SHOUT over the WHIRRING BLADES: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Alan!  What's wrong with a car-- 

                             BAER 
                     I'm giving you an overview of our 
                     little operation!  You gotta see the
                     new breed of high yield saplings... 

     SCHUYLER looks uncomfortable with this prospect.  The driver is
     already loading his bag into the chopper.  Baer claps a hand on 
     Schuyler's shoulder, leading him under the wash, into the chopper. 

     THE RASTA MAN is walking slowly across the tarmac nearby.  He
     watches the HELICOPTER ASCEND with a half-smile. 

     48.  I N T .   H E L I C O P T E R  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER and BAER in the back of the chopper. 

                             BAER
                     How was your flight? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fine. 

     Schuyler looks out the window. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV - On the PASTA MAN in his colorful clothes, now
     holding up a dangling KEY on a chain.  Moments later, he's
     invisible in the MIST. 

     ON SCHUYLER, looking disappointed, and annoyed with himself-- he
     realizes he's missed something.  He reaches into his pocket as Baer
     DRONES ON beside him.  Schuyler pulls out his KEYS, fingers the
     gold one with the CRS logo, thinking. 

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     49.  E X T .   M O U N T A I N S  -  D A Y 

     The HELICOPTER swoops low over a beautiful FORESTED MOUNTAINSIDE.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO: 

     50.  I N T .   B A E R - G R A C E   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 

     PAN from a WINDOW.  Outside, we see a sign-- BAER-GRACE LUMBER-- 
     and the helicopter, now idle on a pad.  MOVE PAST a HUMMING FAX
     MACHINE, find Schuyler addressing Alan Baer across a table.  A
     couple of other LUMBER EXECS are present.  Everyone wears a
     stricken expression, Schuyler's tone is matter-of-fact. 

                             BAER 
                     You've been planning this for months,
                     haven't you?  Sandbagging me like 
                     this, selling us for scrap... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     BG lumber is not profitable and 
                     hasn't been for years, my duty is to
                     salvage what I can.  These are the
                     closing papers, in ten minutes I'm
                     going to present the sale terms to
                     the shareholders and elect my new 
                     management team. 

     As he speaks, Schuyler moves to the fax machine.  A TRANSMISSION
     has come through, he picks up the sheaf of papers. 

                             BAER 
                     I was friends with your father, you
                     bastard, I watched you grow up, and
                     now you kick me in the balls-- 

     Schuyler squints at the papers in his hand, flipping through them. 

     CLOSE, the entire transmission has been GARBLED.  The words all
     BLEED TOGETHER incomprehensibly, it looks like a child's scribbles. 

                             BAER (O.S.) 
                     That's not how you play the game. 

     SCHUYLER turns on him, a suspicion forming...

                             BAER 
                     You could've fucking told me! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What game? 

     Schuyler studies the SENSELESS PAGES for a moment then puts them
     down, shaking off his apprehensions. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Never mind... we'll just have to
                     go with the earlier draft. 

     In BG, one exec picks up a page, WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT, who
     moves out of the room.  Schuyler moves to his briefcase.  It's
     LOCKED.  He starts patting his pockets. 

                             BAER
                     Can't find your keys? 

     Baer has a malevolent expression.  Schuyler looks at him. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Where are they. 

                             BAER
                     Up your ass?

     A couple of execs stifle chuckles.  Schuyler's suspicions mount. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Up my ass, very funny... 

     His eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in
     front of him.  He picks it up:

     INSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note:
     "CRS CALLED."  We don't see what's written below. 

     SCHUYLER is reeling, paranoia confirmed. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't-- OK.  OK, you're with CRS... 

     Baer stares at him blankly.  Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes,
     seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     So the game, it's just a screen, to
                     blow this deal...

                             BAER 
                     I'm not following you. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Like hell you aren't.  How did you
                     get my brother involved, that's
                     unforgivable.

     The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion.  As
     he speaks, the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK.  Schuyler
     stares at him menacingly.  Hesitantly: 

                             ASSISTANT 
                     Um... sorry to interrupt.  We've
                     been having some trouble with this 
                     fax, so they re-sent the material.
                     It's all OK now. 

     The assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents
     in front of Schuyler.  The assistant fishes in his pocket. 

                             ASSISTANT 
                     Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these 
                     yours?  The pilot found 'em on the
                     floor of the chopper... 

     Schuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out,
     looks from them to the paperwork.  Then he glances back at the
     handwritten note on the table: 

     INSERT NOTE:  It actually reads "CBS CALLED."  (Schuyler's thumb or
     a Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look 
     like an R.)  It continues "Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun..." 

     SCHUYLER takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his
     watch.  He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Everything seems to be in order. 
                     Please disregard my last comments.
                     The shareholders meeting is about
                     to get underway... Shall we? 

     He heads for the door.  As he leaves, the execs exchange looks. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     51.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler wanders through the terminal, carrying his bags, glancing 
     periodically at the DEPARTURES monitor and the clock.  His manner
     now has changed, he eyes every PASSERBY, especially the ODD ONES. 

                             P. A. VOICE (filter) 
                     Flight 177 to San Francisco is now
                     boarding at Gate 14... 

     Suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk, 
     Schuyler TRIPS and goes sprawling.  The Rasta Man steps out, now
     wearing SUNGLASSES with PINK LENSES. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention. 

     Schuyler gets up, dusts himself off.  As calmly as possible:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Listen, I quit.

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Free at last... you won't be
                     needin' this, then. 

     He snatches up the briefcase, dances back a few paces.  Schuyler
     speaks as if to a child. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, cretin.  I'm quitting the game. 

     The rasta man keeps backing away, puts a hand to his ear. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Wha's that, mon?  I didna hear you. 

     Schuyler is pursuing the man, walking faster and faster.

                             SCHUYLER
                     I said I-- shit! 

     The rasta turns and RUNS, Schuyler bolts after him, unable to 
     believe this is happening.  They draw a lot of looks during the 
     brief chase through the terminal, the suited businessman, garment
     bag flapping behind him, in pursuit of the crazy rasta. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Help, help!  The mon is crazy! 

     He runs into a MEN'S ROOM, Schuyler follows a moment later. 

     52.  I N T .   A I R P O R T   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler has the rasta cornered now-- but he doesn't have the
     briefcase.  Both are out of breath.  PISSING MEN look wary. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Where is it? 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Got something better. 

     The rasta men holds out a SHINY KEY on a chain.  Schuyler narrows
     his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I realize you're just some bit 
                     player, but I'd like you to get a
                     message to your employers.  This
                     bullshit is interfering with my 
                     work, it's breaking my concentration
                     and I can't allow that to happen-- 

     THE RASTA makes a sad face, SNIFFLES, still dangling the key. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     If I take that stupid key, will you 
                     give me back my briefcase and go away? 

     The rasta nods with a big grin.  Schuyler steps forward, hand
     extended.  The rasta flings open the door of a STALL beside him and
     hurls the key into the TOILET.  Instinctively, Schuyler moves to
     grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and
     sleeve DRIPPING.  The key is missing from the end of the chain. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What the fuck am I doing?! 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit. 

     He drops the rasta schtick, speaks with an Ivy League accent: 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     So try looking at it through rose-
                     colored glasses... here. 

     He takes off his sunglasses, folds them and tucks them in the
     pocket of Schuyler's suit.  Then he reaches above him and pulls 
     down the briefcase, which was perched on top of the stall.
     Schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I told you, this is over!  I quit! 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     They all say that at first. 

     He gives Schuyler a hearty SLAP on the back and strolls off,
     HUMMING.  Schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head.  He
     puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket. 

     CLOSE ON SUNGLASSES-- there's the image of a tiny GOLD KEY embossed
     on each of the arms. 

     SCHUYLER puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a GLIMPSE
     of himself in the mirror-- he looks silly.  He quickly takes them
     off.  As Schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind... the
     Rasta has slapped a colorful SIGN that reads "KICK ME" on his back. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     53.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y

     THE NEON SIGN FIZZLES in front of this low-rent establishment.

     54.  I N T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 

     BELLS RING and LIGHTS FLASH as a DRUNK plays a PINBALL MACHINE with 
     a lot of body English.  SCHUYLER, stuck at a table right next to 
     the machine, winces at the noise, checks his watch and rises.  He
     makes his way through the lunch hour CROWD to the bar, leans toward
     the bartender, a gravelly-voiced woman-- RONNIE. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I was supposed to meet someone 
                     here, a David Van Orton-- I was 
                     wondering if he'd left a message. 

                             RONNIE 
                     'Fraid not, sorry. 

     He drums his fingers, then whips out a CELLPHONE, spins around
     quickly as he starts to dial-- 

     --and SMACKS into Christine the waitress as she emerges from the
     kitchen carrying a tray-- 

     --SCHUYLER gets hit in the chest with a TRAY OF DESSERTS, colorful
     JELLO, CREAM PIE, etc.  He stands there, stunned and DRIPPING. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Fuck me! 

     She starts picking up plates and silverware, oblivious to 
     Schuyler's own plight; Ronnie charges out from behind the bar. 
     After the first shock, Schuyler CHUCKLES with annoyance.  He wipes
     the phone clean, pocketing it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh this is cute.  Very cute. 

                             RONNIE 
                     What happened here, you OK? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     It was an accident-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     No it wasn't. 

     Ronnie gives Christine a look as she starts wiping at Schuyler with
     a rag.  He picks at his chest, examines the WHIPPED CREAM, tastes 
     it.  Schuyler addresses the kneeling Christine: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What's next, a giant banana peel? 

     CHRISTINE squints up at him, puzzled. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Huh?  Oh I get it-- you're nuts. 

                             RONNIE
                     Chrissy, just apologize... 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Dickhead here was on the phone, he
                     walked right into me! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Drop the act, you've been waiting
                     all day for this moment. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Shut the fuck up. 

                             RONNIE
                     Go home, you're fired. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     What?... 

                             RONNIE
                     You heard me. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Fuck you too. 

     She THROWS a plate on the ground, it shatters, then storms off into
     the kitchen.  Schuyler CHUCKLES angrily, pushing through the slop
     on the floor with his shoe, looking for something. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Let's get this over with... Where's
                     the next key?  Does she have it? 

     Ronnie stares, uncomprehending... Schuyler goes after Christine.

     55.  I N T .   L E O ' S   K I T C H E N  -  D A Y 

     He crosses past a short-order COOK in the grimy industrial kitchen,
     pulling a cube of JELLO out of his lapel pocket.  He finds
     Christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers, as she finishes
     changing into her street clothes.  Her brown uniform hangs from a
     locker door, the nameplate "CHRIS" prominent. 

     CLOSE as his fingers touch the CRS of CHRIS-- they even look a bit
     brighter than the H and the I. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I wish you people could be a
                     little more subtle. 

     CHRISTINE notices him for the first time. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Asshole, just send me the goddamn
                     dry-cleaning bill.  Could you--? 

     She waves a hand at him, "go away" and ducks out of view, finishing
     dressing into punk-grungy street clothes.  She SLAMS the locker,
     starts to push past him, pulling on her backpack bag. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Don't you have something for me? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Uh-huh sure, here you go. 

     She puts her hand into her side pocket, pulls it out with her
     middle finger extended, moving away from him in a hurry.
     Schuyler's face falls-- he made another mistake. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wait, you really work here-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Not anymore, thanks to you. 

     She's out the SWINGING kitchen door.  Schuyler absorbs his blunder
     for a moment, then hurries after her. 

     56.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 

     Schuyler catches up as Christine hurries toward a MUNI station,
     LIGHTING a cigarette.  A few PEDESTRIANS come off the steps from
     the arriving elevated train in this residential SF neighborhood. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Slow down-- you don't understand, I
                     thought it was a gag. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No, you don't understand.  I carry
                     mace and I know how to use it. 

     She reaches into her purse/backpack, Schuyler backs off. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I was only trying to apologize. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Shit, it's in here somewhere-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fine. 

     He starts to move away, then they both hear GASPING O. S.-- 

     ON THE STEPS, a HEAVY MAN, 60, in a coat and tie has collapsed, 
     struggling for breath, very pale.  Christine and Schuyler are the
     only pedestrians around now. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Shit-- 

     She rushes to help the guy, loosening his tie-- he JOLTS. 

     SCHUYLER looks up at them dubiously, brushing a scrap of food still
     clinging to his suit. 

     CHRISTINE reaches in to clear the guy's throat, starting CPR.  She
     shoots a look at Schuyler. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You got a fucking phone, call an
                     ambulance! 

     Schuyler approaches slowly, pulling out his phone, studying the guy as
     Christine gives him mouth-to-mouth. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This is just too weird-- it can't
                     be real-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You really are insane! 

     SCHUYLER leans close to look at the man. 

     ON THE MAN'S FACE-- sweating, contorted, unnaturally pale, his eyes
     rolling back as he GAGS his last...

     CHRISTINE grabs the phone away from Schuyler, dials. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     We need an ambulance, guy's having a 
                     heart attack near the MUNI station at
                     5th and Market-- 
                          (to Schuyler) 
                     What's the number on this thing?! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't give it out-- 
                       (off her horrified look)
                     731-5723-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     731-5723-- yeah, thanks--

     She stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the man's chest, returns
     to the mouth-to-mouth.  Schuyler looks around uncomfortably, 
     starting to believe this is a real heart attack. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Is there anything I can do? 

     CHRISTINE ignores him, all attention on saving this guy's life...

     56A. WIDE as an AMBULANCE pulls up, SIREN BLARING.  A couple of
     MALE PARAMEDICS hurry out with a stretcher. 

     ON THE STEPS, the two PARAMEDICS lift the unconscious HEAVY MAN
     onto the stretcher while Christine and Schuyler stand aside.  Both
     have small EARPIECES that look like hearing aids, with wires into
     their clothes.  Throughout the following, there's a lot of MEDICAL
     BUSINESS-- feeding the victim OXYGEN, giving him INJECTIONS, etc. 

                             PARAMEDIC #1
                          (to Schuyler) 
                     Could you come with us, help us
                     fill out a few forms-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No!  I have work to do-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     I'll go. 

     She climbs into the back, they start to shut the doors. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wait a minute, you've got my phone-- 

     He climbs in to get it back, they SLAM THE DOORS and start moving. 

     THE AMBULANCE peels out.  We now see the LOGO on the back:
     "CITYWIDE RESCUE SYSTEMS," with the C, R and S in RED. 

     57.  I N T .   A M B U L A N C E  -  D A Y 

     The PARAMEDICS are intent on the gasping man.  The SIREN BLARES, a
     bit MUFFLED in here.  Schuyler, looking out the back, is extremely
     pissed, makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Chill, will you?! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I don't want to be here. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Neither do I, now siddown, get
                     outta their way! 

     A BUMP almost sends him flying atop the stretcher.  Schuyler sits
     near Christine on a ledge near the back doors.  Petulant: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'd like my phone back please. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     58(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I T A L   E N T R A N C E / G A R A G E  -  D A Y 

     An UNDERGROUND RAMP, signs reading "EMERGENCY VEHICLES ONLY," a set
     of DOORS leading into the lobby of an EMERGENCY ROOM; MEDICAL
     PERSONNEL visible inside, INJURED PEOPLE, etc., a few PEOPLE mill
     outside the doors. 

     THE AMBULANCE SCREECHES to a stop, the back doors fly open, the
     PARAMEDICS wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance,
     automatic doors OPEN and CLOSE for them.  Schuyler and Christine
     climb out, disoriented, walking more slowly to the doors.  The
     AMBULANCE pulls away behind them.  Schuyler nearly slips in a
     mysterious dark PUDDLE. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh, this day keeps getting better. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What is your problem, you think 
                     the whole fucking world revolves
                     around you? 

     As she says this, she walks right into the ELECTRIC DOORS, which
     fail to open for them. 

     THEIR POV-- THROUGH THE DOORS the gathered STAFF and PATIENTS all
     turn at once to regard Christine and Schuyler.  They GRIN and WINK. 

     ON SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE, who barely get the chance to register
     this before-- 

     THE LIGHTS GO OUT... PITCH BLACKNESS and SUDDEN SILENCE.  We hear 
     only SCHUYLER'S BITTER LAUGHTER.  Dialogue OVER DARKNESS: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     As a matter of fact... 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What the fuck is going on?! 

     We hear RUSTLING in a purse, but still see next to nothing. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It's a little hard to explain...

                             CHRISTINE
                     Try! 

     We hear the STRIKING OF A MATCH, there's some ORANGE LIGHT--
     CHRISTINE holds the match.  The whole area is DESERTED, except for 
     the two of them.  SCHUYLER kicks at the glass doors-- they're not
     going to give, nothing is visible beyond them. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I seem to be playing a game.  This
                     is supposed to be funny-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     I don't get it.

                             SCHUYLER
                     --a challenge, a puzzle. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     OK, I'm puzzled.  Where are we? 

     SCHUYLER has found a STEEL DOOR with a GLOWING RED SIGN:  EMERGENCY
     USE ONLY.  He yanks it open and a PAIL swings down, dumping WATER
     on his head.  He's facing a BRICK WALL through the door. 

     CHRISTINE can't help but LAUGH, then YELPS in pain as the match
     burns her fingers.  LIGHTS another.  Schuyler flips open his phone.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Damn it, no signal. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Here's a lightswitch-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I wouldn't-- 

     She flips it on, A BLINDING STROBE FLASHES for a few seconds-- both 
     CRY OUT-- then the BULB EXPLODES in a shower of sparks. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't know the rules, if there are
                     any, but it seems the obvious move
                     usually backfires...

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Of course.  I have no idea what 
                     you're talking about.

     They've taken a few steps forward, exploring the DARK.  She LIGHTS
     a cigarette with the next match, nearly running into ANOTHER DOOR.
     She RATTLES it-- locked. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Son of a bitch. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I think I have a key. 

     Schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold CRS key-- nope. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Damn it... 
                       (a beat, thoughtful)
                     Wrong key... 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Last match. 

     In the matchlight, we see Schuyler fumbling in his pockets, pulling
     out the ROSY SUNGLASSES from the Rasta.  He puts them on. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Too bright for you, is it? 

     SCHUYLER'S POV as the last MATCH GOES OUT-- CHRISTINE GLOWS RED in
     the matchlight for a moment, then as soon as it goes out, we see a
     GLOW of FLUORESCENT PAINT on the ground... a series of STRIPES and
     ARROWS in DIFFERENT COLORS, GLOWING.  These start PARALLEL near
     where he stands, then RADIATE in different directions.  CHRISTINE
     is but a SILHOUETTE against the COLORED LINES.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I can see now.  Grab my arm. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No way!  You're crazy! 

     CHRISTINE moves away from him. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Stay on the path! 

     A BURST OF FLAME erupts from the GROUND close enough to scare the
     shit out of CHRISTINE, who SCREAMS.  SCHUYLER hurries toward her. 

     The FLAMES VANISH, she lurches in a differrent direction-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Christine, don't move! 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Leave me alone!

     She LOSES HER FOOTING on a slippery surface, falls, sliding down a
     gentle SLOPE. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Help! 

     SCHUYLER follows.  FALLING himself.  They try to reach toward each 
     other for purchase, but it's no good, the slope is getting steeper.

     58A. In a moment SCHUYLER tumbles on top of Christine in a four-
     foot deep round CHILDREN'S POOL, but it isn't full of water.
     There's a bit of BLACK LIGHT here, enough to make out-- 

     --COCKROACHES, thousands of them, a TEEMING ROIL OF INSECTS in a
     CHURNING LIQUID.  There's a BUZZING NOISE, both SCREAM. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Aaggh!  BUGS!! 

     SCHUYLER quickly helps lift Christine out.  She starts to pull him
     upward, but-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Where are the glasses?! 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Fuck the glasses! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     We can't get out of here without them! 

     He steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick,
     finally coming up with the glasses.  He shakes them free of INSECTS
     and clambers out to join Christine, who's GASPING and brushing the
     bugs off of her.  SCHUYLER puts on the glasses and holds up a BUG. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     They're rubber.  Hold onto me,
                     I'll get us out of here.

                             CHRISTINE
                     Ha! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fine, stay. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     No! 

     She grabs his arm; both are now covered in MUCK from the bug soup. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What's your favorite color?

                             CHRISTINE
                     ...Blue? 

     He takes off the glasses, puts them on her.  She looks around.

     HER POV-- the RAINBOW of COLORED LINES on the FLOOR...

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Wow... OK, this is kinda cool.  Hey! 

     SCHUYLER slips the glasses off her, puts them back on.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Sorry, it's my game.  But we'll
                     take blue. 

     HIS POV-- a BLUE LINE moves in a snaking path ahead of them, going
     in circles now and then, INTERSECTING or moving PARALLEL to other
     colors, up a series of ramps.  This space sometimes resembles a
     PARKING GARAGE, scmetimes a SEWER or a STEAM TUNNEL. 

     CHRISTINE keeps a hand on Schuyler as he follows the path. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Talk about the blind leading the
                     blind... what's your name anyway? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Sky Van Orton. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Sky?  Were your folks hippies or
                     something? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Far from it. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I'm Christine Kaminsky. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Nice to meet you. 

     58B. LATER, CHRISTINE almost hugs Schuyler now, as they move in a
     seemingly random pattern in the darkness. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It's a company called Consumer 
                     Recreation Services, CRS.  I never
                     know what's gonna happen next. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Well, who does. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Until recently, I had a pretty
                     good idea... Duck. 

     The BLUE LINE has led them into a NARROW TUNNEL, soon they're
     crawling on hands and knees. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     So are you like a serious masochist,
                     or just really, really bored? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been
                     dragged into this. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Well... I have to tell you 
                     something.  Some guy came into 
                     Leo's yesterday, showed me your 
                     picture, offered me 250 bucks to
                     spill that food on you. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Ah. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Said it was a practical joke.  I
                     figured what the hell, I can use
                     the money-- I got him up to 500. 
                     I hated that fucking job anyway-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wait, so the heart attack, you
                     knew that was a joke too-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No!  It scared the shit out of me-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     But that CPR routine-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I used to be a lifeguard. 

                             SCHUYLER
                             (points) 
                     We're getting somewhere... 

     The TUNNEL has opened up again.  There's even a tiny bit of VISIBLE
     LIGHT now.  He takes off the glasses, gives them to her. 

     HER POV-- the COLORED LINES are all joining up from different
     directions.  A few steps onward they all converge at a point, like
     the spokes of a wheel, at a WHITE SPOT on the ground...

     SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE look around, then Schuyler points upward-- 

     A WHITE RING overhead... it looks like the underside of a MANHOLE
     COVER, with an illuminated CIRCLE OF LIGHT around the rim, a halo. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     How do we get up there? 

     SCHUYLER steps on the circle of WHITE-- it's a BUTTON.  A ROPE
     LADDER drops down. 

     59.  E X T .   W A L K W A Y  -  E V E N I N G 

     A MANHOLE COVER slides aside, SCHUYLER climbs out and helps
     Christine up.  It's a short, covered WOODEN WALKWAY in an alley. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Well, that was pointless... but
                     different... kind of fun... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mm, a different kind of fun.
                     What's your middle name? 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Louise... why? 

     SCHUYLER points to some GRAFFITI-- a HEART with "SVO + CLK." 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're supposed to be here... they
                     picked you for a reason. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     But-- why? 

     They start to move shakily down the CONSTRUCTION WALKWAY, both
     bedraggled, covered in goo.  HANDBILLS cover one wall. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Probably knew you'd play Good 
                     Samaritan for that guy, drag me 
                     along-- but they could have hired an 
                     actor for that, less of a risk...

     ON THE WALL, a series of HANDBILLS say, "AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
     SOMETHING?"  SCHUYLER puzzles over these as they move, gets to one
     last one-- "BEHIND YOU, STUPID." 

     SCHUYLER looks back toward the end of the alley-- 

     A YELLOW DUMPSTER with the logo, "CONSOLIDATED REFUSE SUPPLY" and
     the smaller image of a KEY.  SCHUYLER moves quickly to it, throws
     open the lid. 

     ANGLE IN DUMPSTER-- a MOUNTAIN of SHREDDED PAPER. 

     SCHUYLER rolls his eyes, sorting through it.  Christine approaches.

                             CHRISTINE 
                     This is really sick.  I think
                     they're trying to fix us up. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Maybe you can't play alone-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Who says I want to play?
                             (a sigh) 
                     OK, what the fuck are you doing in
                     the dumpster. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     There's something in here I need. 

     He climbs inside, dives in... and pops up again in a moment with-- 

     CLOSE-- A Z-SHAPED WINDOW CRANK.  Sure enough, there's a KEY
     embossed on the side. 

     SCHUYLER climbs out again, brandishing the small crank. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     What's that for? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I imagine I'll find out. 

     60.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  E V E N I N G 

     SCHUYLER pockets the crank as he and CHRISTINE emerge from the
     alley.  PEDESTRIANS give them a wide berth.  To a PASSERBY: 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What are you looking at? 

     Schuyler heads straight for the CRS doors, the large numbers 636
     printed above-- it's LOCKED.  He tries his little GOLD KEY on a
     deadbolt, it's USELESS of course. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This is their offices.  We must
                     have been in their garage... my 
                     office is just a few blocks from 
                     here, we can get cleaned up there. 

     He walks a few steps on, she stands still for a moment, then nods
     agreeably and follows. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     61.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T 

     START ON THE SKYLINE-- SCHUYLER moves from the window, as we hear a 
     DOOR OPEN.  CHRISTINE emerges from the attached dressing area and
     bath, toweling damp hair, in an oversized Harvard sweatshirt and
     gym shorts, with a large plastic bag containing her filthy clothes.
     She looks good, clearly she put some effort into her make-up. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Your turn. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (moving past her) 
                     Find everything you need? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You're outta conditioner. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     My apologies, I'll have it taken care
                     of.  Help yourself to the fridge. 

     He points to a MINI-FRIDGE, shuts the door, a moment later we hear
     WATER RUNNING.  She looks around the office, letting down her
     facade.  She seems quite impressed, and intimidated, by the place.
     She looks back toward the bathroom door-- maybe this guy isn't so
     bad after all.  From this point, she takes a more seductive tack. 

     62.  I N T .   D R E S S I N G   A R E A / B A T H  -  N I G H T 

     LATER, Schuyler has cleaned up, is finishing dressing, pulling a
     pair of jeans over boxer shorts, tucking in a sport shirt.
     Christine talks through the closed door. 

                             CHRISTINE (O. S.)
                     So um... how rich are you anyway? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                             (amused) 
                     Rich enough.  Bit forward, aren't you? 

                             CHRISTINE (O. S.) 
                     Well, what exactly do you do? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Manage investments, some venture 
                     capital, I'm on the board of a number
                     of publicly traded companies... 

                             CHRISTINE (O. S.) 
                     So you just like, move money around? 

     63.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T

     Schuyler emerges, shoes in hand.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Basically.  Beats working, huh? 

     Christine sits on his desk, with her bag slung over her shoulder,
     eating an APPLE.  She slides off the desk, flirting rather bluntly. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You don't look so bad, without the tie. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, I hope you haven't been too
                     put out... I could probably get
                     you another job, I have a stake in 
                     a couple of restaurants--

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I'm not much of a waitress, really.
                     Y'know, today's been kind of-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Can you type? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Kind of a turn-on, you know?
                       (getting no response) 
                     I didn't mean-- just, the danger...
                     Like fucking in a graveyard. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mm.  So where do you live? 

     Christine realizes her come-on is falling flat, she pulls back,
     tossing her unfinished apple in the trash. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Out in Concord, with my folks,
                     unfortunately.  They're never
                     gonna believe that I've been 
                     hanging out with a guy like you. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What do you mean? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Nothing, just-- most of the guys I
                     see have tats, y'know? 
                       (off his confused look)
                     Tattoos... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Of course.  We'd better head 
                     downstairs, the limo's waiting. 

     Christine nods disappointedly as Schuyler moves to the door. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     64.  I N T .   L I M O  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler and Christine ride in silence in the back seat. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Mind if I smoke in here? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Yes. 
                        (leaning forward)
                     Up here on the left. 

     As the limo pulls over, he and Christine turn to each other.  It's
     a somewhat awkward moment. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     So what's our next move?  I mean, in 
                     the game.  Obviously we need to figure
                     out what that crank thing is for-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm not playing anymore. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                          (disappointed)
                     Why not? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I have a life.  Jack'll take you
                     home, or wherever you want to go. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Yeah, maybe I'll get in a little
                     ballroom dancing before bed-- 

     The limo has stopped now.  Schuyler has started to open the door. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Wait, what about your clothes? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Forget it. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     C'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt. 

     So saying, she pulls it off.  She's wearing a black bra... a ROSE
     is tattooed on her shoulder.  Schuyler can't help but react.  She
     thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, it's not-- just-- back from
                     the cleaners. 

                             CHRISTINE
                            (throatily) 
                     You dry clean your sweatshirts... 

     He nods slightly... as he reaches to take it-- 

     --CHRISTINE leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him
     a LONG, HARD KISS. 

     JACK THE DRIVER, middle-aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a
     glimpse of this, quickly turns away. 

     CHRISTINE breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat,
     waiting for Schuyler to make the next move. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     See ya. 

     Schuyler nods again, torn.  She's looking at him expectantly.  He's
     clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female.  Sadly,
     he waves a hand. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Good night. 

     65.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler shuts the door, sweatshirt in hand, the dome light slowly
     DIMS OUT out on the crestfallen Christine-- we see her mouth a 
     CURSE.  Schuyler moves toward his MBZ, the limo IDLING.  He's about
     to get inside when he sees a TICKET IN AN ENVELOPE under the
     windshield wiper.  He SNORTS-- insult to injury-- tosses it on the
     dash as he climbs in. 

     66.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

     He sits behind the wheel, watching the lights of the limo 
     disappear.  He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment, then STARTS at the
     sound of a MOTOR STARTING across the street. 

     ANGLE THROUGH SIDE WINDOW-- an MBZ the same year, model and color
     as Schuyler's-- pulls away from the curb, Schuyler gets a glimpse
     of something REFLECTING STREET LIGHT in the window of the car-- a 
     gun?  A camera with a long lens?  The car makes a quick U-turn and
     drives in the same direction as the limo. 

     SCHUYLER, curious, STARTS THE ENGINE as if to pursue.  Then he
     glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye.  He
     doesn't put the car in gear, picks up the envelope instead... 

     CLOSE ON ENVELOPE-- The words "OPEN ME" are printed in BLOCK 
     LETTERS on the outside.  He opens it quickly-- there's no ticket
     inside, but he shakes out a RAINBOW-COLORED CONDOM in a clear 
     wrapper and a NOTE in KIDNAPPER LETTERS:  "BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY." 

     SCHUYLER frowns at this and throws the note aside.  He flips on the
     WINDSHIELD WIPERS (it's started to DRIZZLE) and pulls out. 

     POV THROUGH WINDESIELD-- A DARK FIGURE runs from the curb by Leo's,
     right in front of the car, SCHUYLER SLAMS on the BRAKES-- 

     --It's DAVID.  He hurries around to the passenger door and jumps
     in, looking haggard, scared, a man on the run. 

                             DAVID
                     Drive.  Anywhere. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Jesus, David, you scared the shit
                     out of me-- 

                             DAVID 
                     I'm sorry Sky, just drive, please-- 

     SCHUYLER pulls forward. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Where were you today? 

                             DAVID 
                     I almost didn't make it at all.  I
                     been in the bar for hours, waiting
                     for you to come back to your car-- 
                     Jesus, I can't believe I did this to
                     you, I'm so sorry-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Slow down, take a breath-- what
                     are you talking about? 

                             DAVID 
                     The game!  It just doesn't stop! 
                     I thought I'd finished playing a
                     long time ago, I paid the bill,
                     then it started all over again,
                     they won't leave me alone-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                         (slowly, evenly) 
                     Calm down.  What are they doing to you? 

                             DAVID 
                     Everything.  It just doesn't stop. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look.  That's crazy.  Yes, it's a 
                     pain in the ass, but why would they
                     keep playing once you paid them? 

                             DAVID 
                     I don't know!  I paid them MORE to
                     make it stop, God help me I even 
                     gave you to them... but they won't
                     leave me alone! 

     He sees the crumpled note on the floor, picks it up-- 

                             DAVID
                     What's this? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It was on my windshield-- 

                             DAVID
                     Oh shit, oh SHIT they must be
                     following us-- 

     He cranks his neck around, looking for pursuers.  Schuyler looks at
     him for a beat-- BANG!  He almost loses control of the wheel.

     A TIRE HAS BLOWN.  Schuyler drives ON THE RIM, struggles to get 
     over to the curb, BRAKES hard and stops. 

     73.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

     David's losing it, looking around.

                             DAVID 
                     They're shooting at us!

                             SCHUYLER 
                     David, get a grip, it's just a
                     flat tire! 

     He picks up the phone, punches buttons, gets nothing. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Damn it, the phone's not working-- 

                             DAVID
                     Of course not. 

                             SCHUYLER
                          (climbing out) 
                     Fine, I'll change the fucking
                     thing myself. 

                             DAVID 
                     Just hurry-- I'll pop the trunk. 

     David reaches for the glovebox. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, you can't do it from-- 

     CLOSE ON GLOVEBOX-- it POPS OPEN and KEYS SPILL OUT.  There are at
     least fifty of them jammed in there, all kinds, silver and gold...
     and all have CRS stamped on them. 

     SCHUYLER leans closer, intrigued.  David's eyes go wide as he
     fingers a few of these keys. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What the fuck are those-- 

                             DAVID 
                        (whirling on him) 
                     Like you don't know.  Sonofabitch, 
                     they got to you first, didn't they? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Um, David-- hello? 

     74(NEW).  E X T .   G O L D E N   G A T E   P A R K  -  N I G H T 

     David gets out of the car in a hurry, amidst the greenery in the
     park.  RAINING HARDER now. 

                             DAVID 
                     It's more than that isn't it?  You're
                     part of it, you're one of them!  Of 
                     course, it makes perfect sense! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     They planted those keys!  I don't
                     know what the hell they're for-- 

     Schuyler tries hard to be rational, but David is over the edge.

                             DAVID
                     You're behind the whole thing aren't 
                     you?  You and your sick fucking
                     friends set it up-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What?!  What friends?  Get a grip,
                     David-- why would I do that? 

                             DAVID 
                     I don't know, out of boredom, to
                     get back at me--

                             SCHUYLER
                     For what?! 

                             DAVID 
                     For being a weirdo, for trying to
                     be happy?  Well, congratulations,
                     you win.  Now make it stop! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (grabbing him) 
                     I can't!  Listen to me-- 

                             DAVID
                     Fuck you! 

     David SLUGS HIM in the face, Schuyler staggers back, clutches his 
     BLEEDING nose.  David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the
     Japanese Tea Garden. 

     SCHUYLER pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of
     breath, calling after David, who's vanished.  He leans against a 
     tree, PANTING, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a SCRAP OF TISSUE
     from his pocket.  He hears a PHONE RINGING, moves toward it,
     emerging through bushes near the ACADEMY OF SCIENCE... 

     He pauses at the RINGING PAYPHONE.  He decides not to pick it up, 
     looking around at the deserted MUSEUM BUILDINGS and hurrying toward
     civilization.  He passes other PAYPHONES en route to the park 
     exit... each one STARTS RINGING as he approaches it.  He moves
     faster, freaked.  At the edge of the park, he snatches one up-- 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     What have you done to my brother,
                     you bastards?!  This is over, I'm
                     not playing anymore--
                              (beat) 
                     Hello, is anyone there-- 

                             PHONE VOICE 
                     If you'd like to make a call, 
                     please hang up and dial again-- if
                     you need help-- 

     SCHUYLER slams the phone down.  He dabs his nose one more time,
     tosses the paper scrap into the trash. 

     CLOSE ON SCRAP-- "CRS" with the emergency NUMBER, the blue ink has
     BLED with the rain and Schuyler's BLOOD...

     SCENE 75 DELETED 

     76(NEW).  E X T .   F U L T O N   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 

     POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD, as Schuyler emerges from the park.  The
     car suddenly MOVES FORWARD-- 

     WITH SCHUYLER.  He walks to the curb, distractedly raises a hand
     for a cab, which pulls up instantly.  He climbs in.

     77.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     An aged, battered CAB; PLEXIGLAS between the CABBIE and the back.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Six three six Mission, please.

     The cabbie nods and hits the gas. 

     78.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T

     The cab roars down the street, KICKING UP WATER from the gutters. 

     79.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler bites his cuticle, not watching where they're going; the 
     windows are wet and fogged.  Then he looks out, narrows his eyes
     and RAPS on the PLEXIGLAS PARTITION. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're heading the wrong way. 

                             CABBIE (filter) 
                     Relax, pal, you'll get where
                     you're going. 

     The cabbie turns IN PROFILE for a moment.  He appears to be wearing
     a HEARING AID, a round piece of plastic, a tiny WIRE disappearing
     into his shirt.  And there's something familiar about his face.
     Schuyler glances at the driver ID on the back of the seat-- 

     CLOSE ON PHOTO, the man is the RASTA from the airport, with a new
     hairdo.  The COMPANY NAME-- "CONSOLIDATED REGENCY SEDANS."  CRS. 

     SCHUYLER rubs his head, very angry.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Why are you doing this-- 

                             CABBIE/RASTA (filter) 
                     We do it all for you!  We're the best
                     friends you got, no one ever worked 
                     so hard to make you feel alive... but
                     you gotta let it happen...

     The cab STOPS at a RED LIGHT.  SCHUYLER tries the doorhandle-- it
     doesn't work. 

     80.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 

     The cab PEELS OUT when the light turns green, heads for a pier.

     81.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler looks around in increasing panic. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What the fuck is this-- 

                             CABBIE/RASTA
                     Have a nice day...

     The cabbie opens his own door and leaps out of the MOVING CAB-- 

     82.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T 

     The cabbie/rasta hits the ground and ROLLS in a perfect stunt fall.
     The cab rockets to the end of the disused wharf and-- 

     --GOES FLYING off the edge into the San Francisco Bay, illuminated
     by SPOTLIGHTS from the end of the wharf.

     83.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler SCREAMS as the cab plunges and HITS the water.

     84.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T 

     The STEAMING cab's nose slowly DIPS below the surface. 

     85.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     FILLING WITH WATER from the car's floor, from overhead.  EERIE 
     LIGHT from the front of the cab.  Schuyler tries to roll down the 
     window, the handle SPINS, nothing happens.

     86.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T

     The cab GOES UNDER with a BURBLE of BUBBLES.

     87.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler CRANKS the other window handle desperately, now up to his
     waist in water, water GUSHING IN now.  INCREASING BLACKNESS through
     the windows as he sinks.  The handle falls off in his hand.

     88.  U N D E R W A T E R   S H O T  -  N I G H T 

     The sinking cab, HEADLIGHTS and INTERIOR LIGHTS STILL ON, Schuyler 
     inside KICKING at the windows and the Plexi, without any success.

     89.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler stops his frantic kicking, tries to think coolly.  He's up 
     to his neck by now. Angry at himself for not realizing it sooner,
     he pulls what he needs out of his pocket-- the HANDCRANK he found
     in the dumpster.  He takes a deep breath and-- 

     90. SUBMERGES.  UNDERWATER he inserts the crank into the window
     handle hole... a perfect fit.  He CRANKS FAST, WATER FLOODS IN. 

     91.  U N D E R W A T E R   S H O T  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler SLITHERS OUT the open window.  Cheeks puffed out, he kicks
     frantically for the surface. 

     92.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T 

     He BURSTS to the surface, SPLUTTERING, catching his BREATH.  A
     FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him.

                             GIRL 
                     Mister-- are you all right?! 

     Schuyler, treading water, turns around-- 

     A CABIN CRUISER at the dock nearby.  A very beautiful GIRL in a
     yellow rain slicker, holding a powerful FLASHLIGHT leans over the
     edge, tosses him a life preserver, hauls him toward her. 

     93.  E X T .   C A B I N   C R U I S E R  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER clambers onto the rear ladder with the girl's help, teeth
     CHATERING.  HOLD ON the boat's colorfully painted name on the
     stern:  "POSEIDON'S CURSE," and in small letters, "COSTA REY SOL." 

     SCHUYLER boards the large, ritzy craft. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Thank you... I'm very grateful. 

                             GIRL 
                     Shouldn't swim in the Bay, you 
                     could get hepatitis. 

     Schuyler nods, looking around, recovering from the shock.

                             SCHUYLER
                     I have to get in touch with the police.

                             GIRL 
                     You're freezing, I got some dry
                     clothes below. 

     94.  I N T .   B O A T   C A B I N  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler's wet clothes hang from a hook, he's in a towel, starting
     to pull on a fresh set of casual clothes.

                             GIRL
                     Do you need any help? 

     His back is turned as the girl climbs down, opens her raincoat--
     only a STRING BIKINI beneath.  She could be a Playboy centerfold. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Uh, no.  I'm fine.  These fit...
                       (buttoning his pants)
                     ...perfectly. 

     He turns slowly, just as the girl reaches behind her. 

                             GIRL 
                      Sure I can't do something for you? 

     She WINKS as she lets her top drop.  Schuyler smiles strangely. 
     She takes this for lust, approaches him with open arms.  He GRABS
     her by the hair.  Menacingly: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I am finished playing. 

                             GIRL
                     OW!  Let go! 

     She pounds at him, tries to kick.  He wrestles her to the floor,
     kneels on top of her.  He seems about to hit her. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This has got to fucking STOP! 

                             GIRL 
                     You're hurting me! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Who are you!? 

                             GIRL 
                     I just got hired to show you a good
                     time!  C'mon please get off me... 

     Schuyler gets his rage under control, horrified at himself.  He
     climbs off her, she scrambles away, afraid, covering herself.

                             GIRL 
                     I am not into this kinda shit! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Who hired you. 

                             GIRL 
                     I don't know, the service set it up. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     The service? 

                             GIRL 
                     Y'know, Fantasy Girls.  They said
                     you had this wild fantasy, I 
                     should just wait in the boat...

     Schuyler realizes he's not going to get anything more out of her,
     pulls on a shirt, grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin. 

     95.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler leaps off onto the wharf.  The girl, pulling the raincoat
     on, leans over the deck. 

                             GIRL
                     Doncha want your thing?  I'm supposed
                     to give you this, this key thingie...

     Schuyler pauses, turns slowly, approaches. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     A key. 

     THE GIRL nods quickly, reaches over the railing to hand him a SMALL
     WOODEN COFFIN with a BLACK BOW and a RED KEY BURNED into the lid. 

                             GIRL 
                     They said you'd figure out what to
                     do with it. 

     SCHUYLER takes it from her gingerly, undoes the bow, opens the lid:

     ANGLE IN COFFIN-- an ornate HATCHET with a KEY DESIGN on the blade.

     SCHUYLER REMOVES it from its QUILTED resting place.  THE GIRL backs
     away, nervous to see SCHUYLER with a weapon. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm supposed to carry a fucking
                     hatchet around...?  Relax.  I
                     don't want it. 

     He drops the AXE and the COFFIN into the water with a SPLASH-- 

     95PT. THEY GO UNDER and DISAPPEAR...

                                                       CUT TO:

     96.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  D A Y 

     Early morning, the RAIN has stopped-- a RAINBOW arcs behind the 
     office building.  TWO COP CARS, marked and unmarked, pull up at the
     curb, lights FLASHING.

     97.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  D A Y 

     Schuyler, in the clothes from the boat, and Plympton, his lawyer,
     are joined at the elevators by two plainclothes detectives--
     BARNETT and GALLO-- and two UNIFORMS.

                             PLYMPTON 
                     Thank you for your promptness, 
                     officers.  I'm Robert Plympton,
                     Mr. Van Orton's attorney-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Let's go.  Seventh floor.

     98.  I N T .   C R S   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 

     Schuyler enters, followed by the others.  He stops short, reacts.
     WIDE SHOT reveals-- the same offices, now entirely empty.  The
     partitions, the desks, everything has been removed.  A small amount
     of TRASH is scattered on the floor-- the move was evidently hasty. 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     99. LATER.  UNIFORM #1 SPEAKS into his walkie-talkie, COP TALK; #2
     pokes around in a box full of SHREDDED PAPER; Plympton CONFERS with
     Barnett, nods, then both of them cross to Schuyler, who sits on the
     carpet, back to an empty wall.  Barnett checks his notes. 

                             BARNETT 
                     Management company for the building 
                     said this floor hasn't been rented.  We
                     checked with the Secretary of State and
                     the county recorder, there's no listing
                     of a "consumer research service." 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     Recreation service. 

                             BARNETT 
                     Right.  No sign of the boat or the 
                     girl.  Divers got the cab's vehicle 
                     ID, the company junked it a month ago. 

     Gallo, who'd been talking on a phone IN BG, approaches. 

                             GALLO 
                     The numbers you gave us are 
                     disconnected, sir, this was the only
                     address the phone company had.  And
                     we found your car-- it's in impound. 

                             BARNETT 
                     I'm a little confused as to motive 
                     here.  You said your brother sent you
                     to these people...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It's not his fault, he's unstable,
                     he didn't know what he was doing-- 

                             BARNETT
                     And they were supposed to show you
                     a, a good time? 

                             GALLO 
                       (a cautioning look at Barnett)
                     My guess is this Feingold guy's
                     using an alias... is there anything 
                     else you can tell us about him? 

     Schuyler spots an empty CHINESE FOOD CARTON crumpled in the corner.

     CLOSER as SCHUYLER picks up and fingers the container-- Chinese 
     characters on it, the name TUNG HOY. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     He likes Chinese food...

                             BARNETT 
                     Don't worry, Mr. Van Orton, we'll
                     get these jokers. 

     SCHUYLER nods, unconvinced. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     100(NEW).  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   M A N S I O N  -  D A Y 

     PLYMPTON pulls up in his LEXUS, SCHUYLER gets out wearily. 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     There's clearly a civil case once
                     we locate the defendant...

                             SCHUYLER
                     Whatever. 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     Y'know, Sky, things are quiet 
                     since the closing-- you could take
                     some time off. 

     SCHUYLER sighs and nods, closes the car door and waves good-bye.
     He climbs the steps to his front door and Plympton pulls away.

     101(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER enters and automatically reaches for a LIGHTSWITCH-- 

     BLUE SPARKS leap to his fingers, the switch has been RIPPED OUT, 
     leaving exposed WIRING. 

     SCHUYLER CURSES and shakes his hand out.  He looks around in
     disbelief-- the walls are covered in GRAFFITI. 

     "GAME OVER" is the first one we see in the foyer, above the
     HARLEQUIN, who still sits in the only upright chair... but now a
     GLOSSY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO is stuck in its teeth. 

     SCHUYLER pulls out the picture, looks at it, hand trembling-- 

     A POLICE PHOTO of MR. VAN ORTON, his body sprawled in a pool of 
     blood.  It's stamped "PROPERTY SFPD" in red...

                             SCHUYLER
                     Oh, God-- 

     SCHUYLER tosses the picture aside, moves into his living room--

     101B(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  D A Y

     More GRAFFITI everywhere:  "FUCK THE POLICE," "SORE LOSER!," "NO 
     FUTURE," "CRS RULES," assorted OBSCENITIES.  BOOM, as Schuyler
     moves through the living room, CONTACT EXPLOSIVES on the floor
     EXPLODE beneath his feet, making him LEAP and DANCE. 

     OVER THE MANTLEPIECE, A NOTE is stuck into a PAINTING with a
     KITCHEN-KNIFE.  SCHUYLER approaches and rips this down. 

     INSERT NOTE, PAN DOWN SLOWLY, X-CLOSE:  "Like my father before me,
     I kill what I love.  Goodbye, cruel world, blah blah blah..."  A
     RED SIGNATURE ARROW is affixed by a DOTTED LINE at the bottom,
     "PLEASE SIGN HERE."

     SCHUYLER GROANS and crumples the note.  He reaches for a phone-- he
     PICKS up the receiver, it's been MELTED into the body of the 
     telephone.  He throws it aside.  He hears VOICES from the next 
     room, enters cautiously, picking up a SMALL SCULPTURE as a weapon-- 

     lOlC(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   S T U D Y  -  D A Y 

     THE TELEVISION is on, playing a silly-looking CARTOON.  ACTION
     HEROS fly through the air, shooting LIGHT from their eyeballs, etc. 

     SCHUYLER lowers his weapon, moves to shut off the tube.  More
     GRAFITTI over the walls, the books, etc.:  stick figure drawings of
     a MAN HANGING HIMSELF, a BROKEN HEART, a PENIS, a NAKED WOMAN, etc.
     Across the walls, over the TV, are the words, "YOU ARE NOT ALONE."

     SCHUYLER presses the on-off switch-- nothing happens. 

                             ACTION HERO (on TV)
                     Don't touch that dial, Sky! 

     ON SCREEN, THE MASKED ACTION HERO stands proudly, hands on hips,
     before a colorful MOVING BACKGROUND.  It speaks in a cheezy HE-MAN
     VOICE, an ANIMATED MOUTH.  There's a CRS LOGO on its chest. 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Boy oh boy, you fucked up big-time! 
                     Bringing in the cops-- real mistake! 

     SCHUYLER covers his eyes, leans against a chair; this is too much. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     No no no-- 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Oh you're always so negative...

     Schuyler realizes this is a two-way conversation as the CRS-MAN
     WINKS at him, making a stiff WAVE. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     You people are insane...

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Hey, look who's talking to their
                     TV set. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     How did you do this, how did you
                     get in here? 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Simple, we duped your keys the day you
                     came in for your physical, wired the
                     whole house while you were at work. 
                     You rich people all have alarms, but
                     you never set 'em, do you? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, at least leave my brother 
                     alone, he's fragile enough as it is-- 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Don't worry about him, he's just
                     playing his own game-- at a more
                     advanced level, you might say... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You can't just fuck with people
                     like this, you don't know who
                     you're dealing with! 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV)
                             (LAUGHS) 
                     We know exactly who we're dealing
                     with, that's the whole idea!  For
                     a guy with your test scores, 
                     you're pretty slow on the uptake. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What the fuck do you want from me?! 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Sky, I just came to say good- 
                     bye... Too bad it didn't work
                     out, better luck next time.  Uh, 
                     there might be a few loose ends 
                     for you to tie up, but remember--
                     it's not whether you win or lose 
                     that counts, it's how you play the
                     game... ya big loser you... 

     THE SCREEN IMPLODES as SCHUYLER SMASHES IT with the sculpture-- 

                             CRS-MAN (filter) 
                     Ouch!  Take it easy, my hot-headed friend! 

     Schuyler peers into the SMOKING electronics, pulls out a battery
     pack, a small video camera, a loop antenna; the SPEAKER's not dead. 

                             CRS-MAN (filter) 
                     Holy smoke, this was an expensive TV-- 

     He BASHES the equipment repeatedly on the floor with all his might.
     The speaker SPUTTERS OUT, the CRS-MAN'S VOICE at last SILENCED. 

     The PHONE has started ringing during the above.  Schuyler,
     breathless, moves around the room now, trying to find it.  He
     finally tracks it down in the bottom of a GARBAGE CAN, covered with
     disgusting SLIME which he wipes on his shirt. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     Now what?!

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     Yeah, who's this? 

                             MANAGER (filter) 
                     I'm calling from the Claremont 
                     Hotel in Berkeley... we have your 
                     American Express card, you left it
                     at the check-in desk...

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     What?  That's impossible, I've
                     never stayed there-- 

                             MANAGER (filter)
                     Are you sure, sir? 

     SCHUYLER pulls his wallet, spreading his credit cards on the floor. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Son of a bitch.

     START ON THE DUMMY, propped in a chair-- SCHUYLER seizes it,
     SMASHES IT against the wall, the glass head SHATTERS.

     LATE AFTERNOON, the COMPANY LIMO pulls up and Schuyler emerges.

     102B(NEW).  I N T .   C L A R E M O N T   H O T E L  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER crosses the opulent lobby to the desk.  A passing BELLHOP
     gives him a nod and a smile. 

                             BELLHOP 
                     Hello, Mr. Van Orton. 

     Schuyler stares after the bellhop, whom he's clearly never seen
     before.  He proceeds to the check-in desk.  Before he can even 
     introduce himself, the DESK CLERK turns to him with a tight smile-- 

                             DESK CLERK 
                     Mr. Van Orton.  Here's your credit
                     card... and the maid found this
                     under the bed... 

     From under the desk he removes a small ATTACHE CASE, places it
     gingerly in front of Schuyler. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     That isn't mine. 

                             DESK CLERK 
                     It has your initials on it, sir. 

     SCHUYLER examines the case closely for the first time, sees the
     gold monogram, "S. V. O." 

                             DESK CLERK 
                     We'd just as soon you took it with
                     you, in any event... and in the
                     future, you might consider 
                     choosing another hotel for your...

     The man trails off and moves away. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I've never been here before in my life! 

     The man ignores him now.  Schuyler pockets his credit card, thinks
     a beat, then grabs the briefcase.

     JACK drives, Schuyler in back, studying the open briefcase in his 
     lap.  He seems extremely upset, fighting to maintain his wits...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Jack... the woman you took home 
                     the other night, where did you go? 

                             JACK 
                           (puzzled) 
                     Out to Concord... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I know, what was the address? 

     JACK is a bit nervous, he doesn't want to piss off the boss. 

                             JACK 
                     Mmm... it was... Beulah Drive, I
                     think, yeah, offa Oakdale... but
                     didn't you-- never mind. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What? 

                             JACK 
                     Just-- I thought you followed us 
                     there.  There was a black 500SE behind
                     us the whole way, I just assumed...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Shit.  Shit!  It wasn't me, Jack. 

                             JACK 
                     Of course, sir.  It was a white 
                     house, I remember... big tree in
                     the front... with one of those,
                     you know, tire swings...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Jack, I'm serious.  It wasn't me. 

                             JACK 
                     It wasn't you, sir.

     Schuyler looks at the man, who stares straight ahead, not believing 
     him for a second.  Schuyler shakes his head, looks down at the open
     briefcase in his lap. 

     ANGLE IN BRIEFCASE-- a set of HANDCUFFS, assorted BONDAGE GEAR...
     and a few BLURRY POLAROID PHOTOS, showing a NAKED WOMAN with a
     LEATHER MASK chained to a bed.  ONE SHOT shows her shoulder
     clearly-- we see a ROSE TATTOO.

     A female IMPOUND WORKER with paperwork leads SCHUYLER through a
     maze of SMASHED CARS, etc.  IN BG, the COMPANY LIMO pulls away. 

                             IMPOUND WORKER 
                     Triple A changed your tire... bad
                     blow-out was it?  Anyone hurt? 

     Schuyler shakes his head.  They've reached his MBZ.

                             IMPOUND WORKER 
                     Oh.  Just... we were a little curious
                     about the mess in the back... 

     SCHUYLER bends down to look in the window. 

     HIS POV-- THE BACKSEAT has been SLASHED.  A few SPLASHES OF BLOOD,
     not too much.  Schuyler's HARVARD SWEATSHIRT is torn and STAINED
     with blood, crumpled in a corner of the seat. 

     SCHUYLER swallows, recovers quickly. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     A friend's dog-- he'd been hit by a
                     car, I drove him to the vet...
                        (as the cop nods slowly) 
                     Golden retriever, beautiful animal. 

                             IMPOUND WORKER 
                        (handing Sky a receipt)
                     He OK? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Too early to say. 

     He quickly gets behind the wheel. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     108.  E X T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   N E I G H B O R H O O D / H O U S E  -  E V E N I N G

     SCHUYLER'S MBZ cruises past rows of similar-looking, lower-middle- 
     class homes, a pretty shabby neighborhood.  He parks the Benz.  A
     WHITE VAN is parked just up the street, a LOOP AND RABBIT EAR on
     the roof.  PAN to show THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR... A cartoonish logo
     with the CRS MAN holding a wrench by a TV SET in front of a
     RAINBOW, the words "CABLE REPAIR SPECIALISTS."

     ON THE HOUSE, MOVE from a WHITEWALL TIRE hanging on a rope from a
     tree to SCHUYLER as he RINGS the front doorbell of a WHITE HOUSE. 

     AT THE DOOR, an older, working-class man in a T-shirt appears--
     Christine's dad, MR. KAMINSKY.

                             MR. KAMINSKY 
                     Yes? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mr. Kaminsky?  Schuyler Van Orton-- 

                             MR. KAMINSKY 
                     Is that a name?  Look, I'm kinda busy.
                       (starts to close the door) 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You have a daughter named 
                     Christine?  I'm afraid she might
                     be in danger. 

     MR. KAMINSKY narrows his eyes at him as we hear--

                             CHRISTINE (O. S.)
                     Daddy?  Who is it? 

     Schuyler, very surprised, peers around Mr. Kaminsky-- 

     109.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  E V E N I N G 

     Schuyler does a double-take as CHRISTINE comes down the staircase,
     wearing a sweatshirt and shorts.  She lights up when she sees him, 
     then quickly hides her excitement. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Sky?  Hi, Sky. 

     MR. KAMINSKY allows the relieved Schuyler to enter now. 

                             DAD 
                     Well, I'm gonna get back to that
                     carburetor... nice meeting you. 

     Christine's dad WINKS at his daughter as he moves back to the
     basement.  She rolls her eyes, but mouths, "thanks," and then moves
     to sit beside Schuyler in the modest, over-knick-knacked living
     room:  religious pictures and statues, family photos, etc. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I didn't think I'd-- what are you
                     doing here? 

     SCHUYLER is smiling at himself now, shaking his head.  Christine
     reaches across him to FLIP ON a lamp. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Last night, when Jack dropped you
                     off-- did anything happen? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No... unfortunately.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I thought-- eh, you don't wanna know. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Come on-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I thought they kidnapped you,
                     tortured you-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     What?  Who? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     CRS... I saw pictures, girl with a
                     tattoo on her shoulder like yours-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                        (touches her shoulder) 
                     Ssh, my folks don't know about
                     that yet.  So, what-- they wanted
                     ransom from you or something? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, I thought they were trying to 
                     frame me, they planted evidence... 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Why would they do that? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I have no idea, nothing they do makes any
                     sense.  Forget it, it's just a game. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     So that's the only reason you came 
                     out here to East Hell, your stupid
                     goddamn game. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I was worried about you.  I wanted to
                     see you again.

                             CHRISTINE 
                       (thinks for a beat) 
                     If you pretend to mean that, I'll 
                     pretend to believe it.  Well, looks like
                     your pals are trying to keep us 
                     together.  Buy me dinner at least? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Sure, why not. 

                             CHRISTINE
                             (rises) 
                     I look like a slob, let me change. 

     She hurries upstairs.  Schuyler sighs, wondering what the hell he's
     doing here.  He glances at a VIRGIN MARY statue, squints-- then
     unscrews the head, it's a decanter.  He takes a sniff and puts it
     back with a bemused expression.  He takes another sniff, noticing
     something else in the air...

     A WISP OF SMOKE rises from the lamp Christine turned on. 

     SCHUYLER peers beneath the shade.  On the table is a framed
     PHOTOGRAPH of a LITTLE GIRL who could be Christine in a frilly
     white dress, holding flowers. 

     ANGLE INSIDE LAMPSHADE-- a new PRICETAG dangles from the shade
     against the bulb, starting to TURN BROWN, smoking. 

     SCHUYLER licks his fingertips, reaches inside the shade to PULL OFF
     tag-- in doing so, he burns his fingers on the hot bulb, STIFLES a
     curse and jerks his hand away.  He KNOCKS OVER the picture, which
     FALLS to the floor.  Shaking his hand, he rises distractedly, pokes
     his head through a swinging door. 

     110.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T 

     DIMLY LIT from outside.  Modest, surface clutter, hanging pots,
     etc.  Schuyler moves to a sink, turns on the tap and RUNS WATER 
     over his burned fingertips.  He SHUTS OFF the tap, looks around for
     a towel, shaking his hand-- the paper towel dispenser has no roll
     on it.  He pulls open a kitchen drawer--

     ANGLE IN DRAWER-- completely empty.

     SCHUYLER, curious now, opens a cabinet, absently drying his hand on
     his shirt-- also empty.  He tries another couple of drawers, finds
     nothing but scraps of paper, matches.  No utensils.  He exits, a
     disturbing thought forming. 

     111.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  N I G H T

     SCHUYLER picks up the photo to replace it on the table. 

     ANGLE ON PHOTO:  Schuyler slips the picture from its cardboard 
     mount-- it's an ADVERTISEMENT clipped from a glossy magazine, TEXT
     printed on the portion previously unseen. 

     SCHUYLER quickly returns the clipping to its mount, puts the photo
     back on the table as Christine comes downstairs, dressed and made-
     up for a night on the town. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Can you get us into Chez Panisse?  I
                     always wanted to eat there-- 

     Schuyler nods casually toward the photo as she sits beside him. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Is that you? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                          (quick glance) 
                     Mm-hmm, First Communion.
                        (touches his hair) 
                     What's the matter, you look a 
                     little green around the gills-- 

     He grabs her hand away.  Icily:

                             SCHUYLER
                     Don't touch me. 

     His tone alarms her-- he stares at her with hatred.  A silent BEAT
     between them, each tries to assess the new situation.  She realizes
     he's onto her.  She swallows, makes a quick decision.  Suddenly she
     leans close to him, reaching around him to SHUT OFF the table lamp.
     She leaves her arms around him and HISSES in his ear-- she drops
     her lower-class accent, speaks in a clipped, educated voice: 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Don't be stupid.  Don't say anything,
                     not here, they're watching. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (sickened; to himself)
                     God damn it... 

     She kisses him, he doesn't open his mouth, neither shuts their
     eyes.  Then she gets up quickly, moves to a corner of the room. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                       (back in character, accented) 
                     OK, I know a good place we could
                     go and like, be alone...

     She glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling-- 

     ON CEILING, a large SMOKE DETECTOR with a RED LIGHT, a cable from
     it-- there's a small LENS in the center... A HIDDEN CAMERA. 

     SCHUYLER looks at this, starting to rise.  She moves to a window,
     out of range of the camera, beckons him over. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     It's a beautiful night, isn't it? 

     Schuyler comes up beside her, she nods for him to look outside--

     POV-- THROUGH WINDOW-- the CRS VAN.  Christine WHISPERS urgently: 

                             CHRISTINE
                     There's four of them in the van,
                     they're armed.  Just play along,
                     I'll get us out of here-- 

     SCHUYLER turns to her, his voice is tired. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fuck you. 
                      (to surveillance camera) 
                     OK, that's it, game over-- 

     112.  I N T .   C R S   V A N  -  N I G H T 

     CLOSE on a video monitor, Schuyler framed in a FISHEYE SHOT:

                             SCHUYLER (FILTER) 
                     --you can come out now, assholes-- 

     He moves toward the front door, a panicked Christine behind him--

                             RASTA MAN'S VOICE 
                     We're blown, let's do it-- 

     We hear MEN GETTING TO THEIR FEET, see BODIES MOVE in FG. 

     113.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  N I G H T

     Christine's furious and terrified, dashes in front of him, LOCKS 
     and THROWS A CHAIN across the front door. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You idiot!  Come on!

     She starts to pull him away from the door, he throws off her arm. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, enough already.  I've had it. 

     He goes to the window and opens the curtain. 

     THROUGH WINDOW-- the Hack/Cabbie, the Rasta/Pilot and a pair of CRS
     AGENTS (JOHN and PETER from the men's club) hurry toward the house,
     the older men reach inside their jackets-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Now what. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Get away from there!!

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (steps toward her) 
                     Oh, now I suppose they're going to-- 

     THE WINDOWS BLOW IN, GUNFIRE, Christine TACKLES HIM and pulls him
     to the ground as--

     KNICK-KNACKS fly to pieces directly behind where he was standing.

     CHRISTINE AND SCHUYLER keep low as they dash for the kitchen-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Holy shit!! 

     114.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T

     Christine pulls him toward a basement door-- 

     115.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   G A R A G E  -  N I G H T 

     They dash down steps to the darkened one-car garage, mostly empty 
     with a few random tools.  MR. KAMINSKY looks up from a game of
     SOLITAIRE, a day player confused by the sudden commotion. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What is this!? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     God, wake up, it's a con game! 

     THE GARAGE DOOR OPENS, Christine pulls Schuyler against a wall-- 

     A "PARAMEDIC" charges out of the shadows, pulling a handgun--

     IN BG MR. KAMINSKY dives for cover with a frightened NOISE--

     CHRISTINE grabs a WRENCH and CLUBS THE PARAMEDIC, who falls with a
     CRY, clutching his skull.  They hear FOOTSTEPS on the stairs they 
     just came down.  Christine hustles the dazed Schuyler out of there. 

     116.  E X T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     Christine and Schuyler dash for the Benz, climb in and SCREECH OFF.
     CRS MEN run for their van to pursue. 

     117.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler drives for all he's worth, Christine watching behind.

     118.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   S T R E E T S  -  N I G H T

     A brief CHASE, the van pursues the MBZ. 

     119.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

     Christine turns forward, her eyes widen--

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Watch out!!

     120.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 

     The MBZ SIDESWIPES a car as Schuyler runs a light, his WINDSHIELD
     CRACKS, the side of the car's CRUNCHED IN, but he keeps driving. 
     He crosses lanes directly in front of an oncoming TRUCK-- the VAN
     HITS THE BRAKES to avoid getting squashed. 

     Schuyler SKIDS into a narrow alley.  THE VAN, having lost a half a
     block, misses this and continues straight. 

     121.  I N T .   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

     Christine's looking behind as Schuyler drives.

                             CHRISTINE
                     OK, we lost 'em-- 

     She's THROWN FORWARD as Schuyler SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, reaches 
     across her and THROWS OPEN the passenger door, which CREAKS from 
     the collision.  He gives her a shove, she clings to the doorframe-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What are you doing!? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Get out of my car. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I coulda handed you to them!  They
                     find me now I'm dead-- 

     Schuyler pushes harder. 

     122.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   A L L E Y  -  N I G H T

     Christine tumbles into the wet gutter.

                             CHRISTINE
                     Listen to me you bastard-- I know
                     what's going on!  No one else is
                     gonna tell you! 

     Schuyler pulls the door shut, the car starts BACKING AWAY. 
     Christine gets to her feet, looks after him.  He reaches the end of
     the alley and stops-- then SCREECHES FORWARD.  She jumps to the 
     edge of the alley, fearing he's trying to run her down.  Schuyler
     HITS THE BRAKES a few feet away.  He leans across, calls to her. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Get in. 

     123.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You can talk while I drive to the
                     police station. 

     Christine puts a hand on the wheel before he can back up again. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No cops, I got an outstanding warrant.
                        (off his look) 
                     Mail fraud.  I'll get nailed, but 
                     you'll never be able to prove a thing.
                     Just drive. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     124.  E X T .   H I G H W A Y  -  N I G H T 

     The MBZ SPEEDS out of a tunnel on the highway toward SF.

     125.  I N T .   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

     Christine looks out the side window, lights a cigarette.

                             CHRISTINE
                     Heard about this big swindle and--
                     I needed the money.  You wouldn't
                     know what that's like. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Spare me the snide comments.  And
                     please don't do that in here-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Second-hand smoke is the least of
                     your problems. 
                        (blows it in his face) 
                     Shit, they really screwed up, I can't
                     believe they didn't take the time to
                     get the house right. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wait, how did-- before the game,
                     you were working in that bar-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     They planted me in advance, your
                     brother set you up. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh God, David's in on it...? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     It's not his fault, he thought it was 
                     the only way out... just another victim. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     How the hell did they think they 
                     were gonna get my money?

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Honey, they already got it. 

     She gives him a pitying look.  Schuyler throws her a sidelong
     glance; this is absurd.  She gestures at his car phone. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You don't believe me, check your 
                     bank accounts.  Listen, that night
                     in your office, remember?  I 
                     downloaded files off your computer
                     while you were in the shower...

     CAMERA MOVES IN ON SCHUYLER'S FACE during the following and--

                             CHRISTINE (V. O.) 
                     I stuck in a code-breaking program
                     to glve CRS remote access to Van
                     Orton Group files...

     127. --RAPID INSERTS from the CRS OFFICES-- Schuyler's SIGNATURE, 
     financial FORMS, a TAPE RECORDER, TEST FORMS, etc.

                             CHRISTINE (V. O.) 
                     --you'd already given them everything
                     else they needed.  Your handwriting, 
                     voice samples, personal information, all
                     the tests you took... they used the data
                     to generate your passwords. 

     --ON A CRT SCREEN as various combinations of letters and numbers
     SCROLL BY, too quickly for the eye to read. 

                             CHRISTINE (V. O.) 
                     From there they just had to break into
                     the financial networks, transfer your
                     holdings into some dummy accounts--

                     Remember Jim Feingold, guy who 
                     signed you up?  He's one of the 
                     original hackers, did a five-year
                     stretch for zapping Citibank.

                     the whole show. 

     END SERIES OF SHOTS, DISSOLVE TO: 

     128. SCHUYLER'S FACE... LIGHTS through the FRAGMENTED WINDSHIELD 
     cast weird PATTERNS on it.  He's pumping sweat now, reaches for his
     cell phone, dials, hand shaking.  Christine flicks her cig out the
     window; she sounds regretful. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I'm sorry.  They already did your
                     brother, I guess they figured you
                     for a family of suckers...

                     Bet you haven't really been taking 
                     care of business the past few days,
                     huh?  This "game," the psych shit
                     about your dad going sui...

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     Guten tag-- Vilen dank, Englisch... 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     All of it was just to buy time,
                     keep you from paying attention... 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     Blue Two-Five... 6-9-0-D... Yes, I
                     consent to voice-print... My name
                     is Schuyler Van Orton.  I'd like 
                     to know my balance, please... that
                     account is closed?! 

                             CHRISTINE (nervously) 
                     I think maybe you should pull over...

     Schuyler sets his jaw, drops the phone-- and turns the wheel hard.

     129.  E X T .   H I G H W A Y  -  N I G H T

     The MBZ SCREECHES for an offramp. 

     130.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler's on his portable phone at a gas station/convenience 
     store, leaning on the Benz as he pumps gas.  Christine stands out
     of earshot, arms folded, staring at the dark horizon. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     Bob, listen carefully, this is an 
                     emergency.  Feingold and his people,
                     I've called all my banks, they've 
                     drained the accounts, personal and 
                     corporate, everything-- tell the cops
                     I've got one of them with me, we'll 
                     make her testify.  They're trying to
                     kill us, I'm heading for the island
                     in Oregon, if I can still find it. 
                     Bob-- call when you get this message
                     and-- be extremely careful... 

     131.  I N T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 

     START ON-- a thermos full of coffee, foodstuffs, miscellaneous 
     camping supplies as a CLERK holds a credit card, hangs up a phone.
     He looks up at SCHUYLER and CHRISTINE.

                             CLERK 
                     They say I gotta confiscate your card... 

     Schuyler sighs, "of course," Christine fishes in her pocket. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     I think I have some cash. 

     132.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 

     They emerge from the store with a couple of grocery bags, Christine
     sucks an ice cream pop.  They toss the bags in the trunk.

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Money isn't everything, right? 

     Schuyler is seething, clutching the trunk lid for a beat, then
     SLAMS it hard when she steps back, making her jump.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It might be best if you didn't 
                     speak.  I very nearly crushed your
                     skull just now. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     C'mon chill, what'd they take you for, a
                     couple hundred G's?  Chump change for a
                     guy like you, chalk it up to experience. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                       (quietly, restraining himself)
                     Just under a billion dollars. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     A bil--? 
                          (nervous laugh) 
                     You're kidding, right? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Do I look like I'm kidding?
                     This is about more than my 
                     personal lifestyle-- your pals 
                     raided pension plans, charitable
                     foundations, company payrolls...

                             CHRISTINE
                     Oh my God-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't know what kind of jerk-off
                     con games you've played in the 
                     past, but now you're in the big
                     leagues, hon.  You just helped
                     sabotage a small portion of the 
                     national economy-- and destroy a
                     whole lotta lives. 

     He stares at her, she looks sick and truly scared.  He climbs in
     the car.  For once without a comeback, she gets in the car quietly. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     The Benz ZIPS AROUND a logging truck on a DIRT ROAD.

     Schuyler, bleary-eyed, drains coffee from the thermos and tosses it 
     aside.  He glances over at the sleeping Christine, her head tilted
     toward his shoulder; she looks pretty sexy.  He stares at her for a
     moment, SIGHS and turns away. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     A beautiful Northern lake-- dense forests on the mainland, pines 
     and fall foliage.  A STORM coming in, ominous CLOUDS.  The Benz is
     parked at the shoreline.  MOVE TO FIND Schuyler and Christine, as
     they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly
     humble, somewhat decrepit cabin on it.  A FLASH OF LIGHTNING. 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     136.  I N T .   O R E G O N   C A B I N  -  D A Y

     CHRISTINE pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood-burning
     stove in which a FIRE CRACKLES.  This cabin is genuinely rustic and
     run-down-- hewn wood, fishing rods, cobwebs, rain damage, dust.
     WATER DRIPS from the ceiling in a few places.  LIGHTNING FLASHES in
     BG through the scene, the STORM has gotten pretty bad. 

     SCHUYLER finishes taking out his contacts, DROPPING them in cups
     full of water. He slips on his glasses, then looks at a few framed
     family photos on the coffee table in front of him.  Christine,
     barefoot, brings him a cup of coffee, which he sips gratefully. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're not having any? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Never drink it.  Makes my tits hurt. 

     Schuyler gives her a sidelong glance, looks back at a photo. 

     ON PHOTO-- he rubs away the dust from a shot showing Schuyler's
     father, with young Schuyler, on a boat with fishing equipment. 

     CHRISTINE takes a step and CRIES out, clutching her foot and 
     sitting beside Schuyler.  A small FISHHOOK protrudes from her foot, 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Hold still. 

     He talks while he carefully removes the hook from her foot. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Sorry, this place hasn't been cleaned
                     in a while.  My dad built it himself,
                     spent a lot of time here alone.
                         (regards a LEAK)
                     Rotten carpenter...

     He pulls out the hook, puts it aside; she rubs her foot. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Thank you. 

     SCHUYLER suddenly starts LAUGHING, wipes tears from his eyes. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     What's so funny? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Just-- private joke...

                             CHRISTINE
                     Tell me. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Well... I always told myself I 
                     wasn't gonna end up like him.  And
                     now here I am, running his 
                     corporation, living in his house,
                     hiding in the cabin where he went
                     to hide right before he... I even
                     look like the bastard. 

     Christine looks at the photo of MR. VAN ORTON, then at Schuyler. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Not that much. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mm, plus I'm a helluva lot more
                     gullible than he ever was...

     THE CELL-PHONE CHIRPS, Schuyler shakes off his self-pity, snatches
     up the handset. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Yes. 

     CHRISTINE mouths, "Who is it?" 

                             PLYMPTON (filter) 
                       (careful, worried)
                     It's me, Schuyler... I got your message... 
                     I'll admlt, I was very disturbed... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (hand over phone)
                     My, lawyer. 
                          (to Plympton)
                     So.  What's our next move? 

     During the following, Christine's eyes go wide, she shakes her head
     frantically, draws a finger across her throat-- 

                             PLYMPTON (filter) 
                     I've been on the phone all morning... your
                     funds are intact, nothing's changed, 
                     there's been no activity whatsoever...

     SCHUYLER struggles to absorb the import of this as well as
     Christine's behavior.  She shakes her head with a sigh, rises to
     refill his coffee cup. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Wait-- that's not true-- 

                             PLYMPTON (filter)
                             (firmly) 
                     It is true, no one is after your 
                     money, no one is trying to hurt you-- 

     SCHUYLER looks at Christine with horror.  She nods and WHISPERS: 

                             CHRISTINE
                     He's in on it. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Oh, God...

                             PLYMPTON (filter)
                     Listen to me, Sky! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What are they paying you, Robert?
                     Piece of the action? 

                             PLYMPTON (filter) 
                     Schuyler!  Look, you've done the 
                     right thing going up there, maybe 
                     it's best if you just sit tight for
                     a while, forget about everything,
                     it's all under control-- 

     Schuyler HANGS UP, breathing hard, pacing, clutching the phone. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     We have to get out of here! 

     Christine approaches him with a fresh cup of coffee, which he sips.
     The PHONE CHIRPS again, Schuyler THROWS it violently against the 
     wall, it's silenced.  He gulps more coffee, rising again, looking
     at the smashed phone, sickened by his own loss of control. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Well, that was stupid. 

     Christine watches him closely.  He keeps balling his hands into
     fists as he paces, trying to think out his next play. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     OK, they've gotten to him.  OK.
                     Is there anyone I can trust? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Mm... I wouldn't worry about it. 

                             SCHUYLER
                             (a beat) 
                     What do you mean? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     It's out of your hands. 

     He takes a step, stumbles, shakes his head to clear it.  She rises,
     picks up his half-empty cup and heads for the kitchen area.  His
     gaze follows this, he realizes he's been drugged. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Christine!!

                             CHRISTINE 
                     That's not my name. 

     With a CRY OF RAGE he lunges after her, but CRASHES into the wall,
     clutching at a hanging ROD, which falls when he does-- he KNOCKS
     OVER the table of photos as he goes down, PANTING for air like a
     fish out of water, clutching his stomach, nauseated. 

     HIS POV-- SIDEWAYS, LOW ANGLE.  SFX, BLOOD POUNDING in his head.
     Schuyler's eyes FOLLOW the GROOVES of the wet, warped hardwood
     floor, they lead to-- and almost seem to point to-- Christine. 

     ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE-- from the counter she picks up a small vial
     with a bit of powder at the bottom, slips it into her pocket. 

     SCHUYLER's eyes roll into his head as he struggles against the
     effects, tries to get to his hands and knees.  He gasps:

                             SCHUYLER
                     Why...

     CHRISTINE approaches, stands a few feet away, lights a cigarette, 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     We needed you to call your banks. 
                     Cellular calls can be intercepted,
                     rerouted, y'know.

     She crouches by him, flicking ashes a few inches from his nose. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     All those calls to Switzerland and 
                     Chase Manhattan-- you were talking to
                     our people.  See, we were still
                     missing a lotta pieces-- access 
                     codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton
                     didn't have-- but now we have 
                     I everything.  I guess you are pretty
                     fucking stupid-- but thanks. 

     He CLAWS at her helplessly with a GROAN, but misses.  His glasses
     fall off, he collapses again.

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- everything a BLUR NOW, except in EXTREME FG-- the 
     photo of himself and his father, which now lies on the floor.

     137. FLASH-CUT TO:  FLASHBACK POV-- THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, as MR. 
     VAN ORTON'S FACE SMASHES into the ground, his GLASSES SHATTERING,
     BLOOD SPRAYING from his head. 

     138. CUT BACK TO:  SCHUYLER writhes, fighting the drug. 

     139. FLASH-CUT TO:  The moment of his father's jump-- only in this
     HALLUCINATION, SCHUYLER himself wears the robe, leaps into space. 

     140. SCHUYLER'S POV-- FROM FLOOR-- Christine moves INTO FOCUS,
     crouches near him, studying her victim almost clinically. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     It's over.  Just let go...

     The SFX POUNDING STOPS, and-- 

                                                  CUT TO BLACK

     BREATHING... THEN SCREAMING, POUNDING and KICKING...

     141.  I N T .   C R Y P T  -  D A Y 

     A WOODEN LID SPLINTERS as SCHUYLER pounds his way out of a COFFIN.
     DIM LIGHT through CRACKS in the walls, this is an old and moldering
     MAUSOLEUM, other COFFINS nearby.  FRESH FLOWERS surround his 
     resting place, otherwise everything is completely DECAYED.

     By the time SCHUYLER gets out of the coffin, his arms are BLOODIED.
     He's been dressed in an ALL-WHITE BURIAL SUIT.  A RED ROSE is TAPED
     to his chest.  He blinks and stares about wildly-- 

     HIS POV-- BLURRY, can't make out much. 

     SCHUYLER blinks, breathing hard, utterly freaked.  He notices the
     ROSE on his chest, tears it off, SNIFFS it, then THROWS IT aside
     with a frustrated CRY.  He stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt,
     tugs, then realizes it opens the other way-- he gives it a PUSH-- 

     142.  E X T .   C E M E T E R Y  -  D A Y 

     IT COLLAPSES immediately.  SCHUYLER tumbles out of the crypt into
     the HOT SUNLIGHT.  He's in a ramshackle city of the dead, a SPANISH
     GRAVEYARD.  There are endless rows of TOMBS, rioting tropical
     VEGETATION, many FLOWERS, impossibly bright COLORS.  It should be
     quite beautiful and peaceful...

                             SCHUYLER
                     What? 

     He walks around tentatively, SQUINTING.  AN OLD WOMAN in black sits
     contemplating a grave, fingering her rosary.  SCHUYLER slips a hand
     absently into his pocket, and finds something there, pulls it out-- 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- BLURRY shot of a NOTE in SPANISH, with a KEY on
     the stationery...

     SCHUYLER blinks, slips the note in his pocket. 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     143.  E X T .   C E N T R A L   A M E R I C A N   S T R E E T  -  D A Y 

     TIGHT SHOT on Schuyler blinking, disoriented, JOSTLED by a sea of 
     HISPANIC PEOPLE on this busy street. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- WALKING TENUOUSLY.  The world's a BLUR, FACES move
     in and out of FOCUS.  They're dark, foreign, many POOR PEOPLE, 
     poverty-scarred features.  Scraps of SPANISH.  He grabs a DARK MAN.

                             SCHUYLER
                     Where am I?! 

     The man replies with an EXCLAMATION in SPANISH, pushes Schuyler
     away, CAMERA TUMBLES-- 

     OBJECTIVE SHOT-- Schuyler's on his knees in the middle of this
     third-world thoroughfare, utterly disoriented.  STREET VENDORS sell
     weird-looking foods, squads of SQLDIERS march with rifles, 
     MUSICIANS PLAY odd instruments... Schuyler clutches his head, as if
     trying to wish it all away. 

     A COP IN BEIGE UNIFORM suddenly prods at him with a nightstick,
     YELLING AT HIM in SPANISH to move on. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- the COP looming over him, a BLURRY menace, the end
     of the nightstick SHARP in FG as it POKES at him. 

     ANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler pleads with the man: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Please, help me, I'm an American!
                     I'm lost!  Please!! 

     This doesn't seem to help.  He tries to get away from the stick,
     but the cop pursues.  He bangs into people as he tries to move
     quickly, the stick right behind him. 

     Schuyler FALLS over a BEGGAR on the ground, in far worse shape than
     he is.  The cop YELLS at him.  Schuyler covers his head, holding 
     out the NOTE WITH THE KEY, which the cop finally snatches away.  He
     studies it for a moment, then BARKS with LAUGHTER. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- the cop reaches down to him-- 

     OBJECTIVE ANGLE-- Schuyler cringes, expecting a blow, but the cop
     just pulls him to his feet.  He drags him away with him, speaking
     more gently IN SPANISH, amused.  Schuyler nods thankfully. 

     HIGH ANGLE-- the THRONGS on this crowded street. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     144.  I N T .   F O R E I G N   P O L I C E   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y 

     A DESK SERGEANT studies the note, approaching SCHUYLER, whose face
     is now red, SUNBURNT.  He sits on a bench with a VAGRANT or two.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Hello.  Where am I? 

                             DESK SERGEANT
                     Tegucigalpa. 
                       (off Schuyler's blank look)
                     Tegucigalpa.  Tegucigalpa? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     That's gibberish! 

                             DESK SERGEANT
                            (annoyed) 
                     It is the capital of Honduras. 

     SCHUYLER buries his face in his hands, nods.  He's relieved to have
     found an English speaker at least. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Right. 

                             DESK SERGEANT 
                     So-- you have become, lost from,
                     from your father...? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     My father's dead, God damn it.  I have
                     to get to the United States embassy. 

     The sergeant cocks his head, confused.  Indicating the note:

                             DESK SERGEANT 
                     Do you know what this says? 

                                                       CUT TO:

     145.  I N T .   A M E R I C A N   E M B A S S Y   L O B B Y  -  D A Y 

     An Hispanic embassy WORKER behind a desk with a U. S. flag
     TRANSLATES THE NOTE aloud in amazed, unaccented English. 

                             WORKER 
                     "I am an American.  I am an idiot.
                     My father is very rich.  If I 
                     become lost, please take me to the
                     police.  There is a reward." 

     ANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler, utterly humiliated, sits in a chair on
     the other side of the desk. 

                             WORKER 
                     Mr. Van Orton... is this a joke of 
                     some sort?  What are you doing here? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I don't know. 

                             WORKER 
                             (a beat) 
                     Well, without any identification it 
                     will take at least a week to get you
                     a temporary visa-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                             (rising) 
                     A week?!  Christ knows what they
                     can do in a week-- and what the
                     hell am I supposed to, to live
                     on?!  What day is it anyway? 
                        (squints at his watch, thinks)
                     Where's the nearest pawn shop? 

                                                       CUT TO:

     146.  I N T .   W E I R D   B O D E G A  -  D A Y 

     A middle-aged Latina-- the BODEGA LADY-- counts out a stack of
     bills on the counter, beside Schuyler's watch.  Her store displays
     JEWELRY, KNIVES, MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, as well as mystical CANDLES,
     POTIONS and BOTTLES with DEAD ANIMALS in formaldehyde. 

                             PAWN SHOP OWNER 
                     This will buy you a plane ticket.

     On the other side of the counter, SCHUYLER Sorts through A BOX OF
     EYEGLASSES, trying on different pairs. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yeah, well I, I seem to have lost my
                     passport... 

     The pawn shop owner nods knowingly.  There's one other CUSTOMER, a
     shabbily-dressed but honest-looking HONDURAN MAN, looking through a
     BIN full of sports equipment.  He seems to have been eavesdropping,
     the pawn shop owner now exchanges a few words with him IN SPANISH,
     clearly they're coming to some kind of deal.  Meanwhile, Schuyler
     puts on a rhinestone-studded pair of woman's glasses, looks around. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Huh, close enough...

                     This man says he can help you...

     Schuyler narrows his eyes at the Honduran man, who flashes a
     crooked-toothed smile.

     A large, covered STAKE TRUCK RUMBLES BY on a hilly jungle highway.

     148.  I N T .   S T A K E   T R U C K  -  D A W N 

     In the back of the truck, Schuyler rides among HUNDREDS OF BAGS of
     COFFEE BEANS, marked "CAFE, PRODUCTO DE HONDURAS."  He wears the
     silly rhinestone glasses, as well as cheap new clothes-- shorts, a
     Spanish message T-shirt, sneakers.  He munches on a mango, peeks
     out a hole in the tarp at the passing scenery.

     HIS POV-- a VISTA of spectacular beauty, ideally jungle-encrusted
     MAYAN RUINS against the backdrop of the rising sun. 

     SCHUYLER's quite taken with the view, despite his troubles.

     The stake truck is parked at a U. S. BORDER CROSSING in the desert. 
     The Honduran man-- the truck's driver-- shows his papers to an
     INSPECTOR as he walks him to the back of the IDLING truck. 

     ANGLE FROM INSIDE TRUCK as a tarp is lifted.  The inspector glances
     inside, examines a couple of COFFEE BAGS.  IN FG, Schuyler hides
     below a bag or two, holding his breath.  The tarp falls again,
     Schuyler exhales with relief in the darkness.

     MOS, SCHUYLER has been reduced to pan-handling for bus fare in 
     front of a San Antonio BUS STATION.  An OLDER MAN takes pity, gives
     him a bill, he moves on to a couple who shake their heads and avoid
     looking at him.  He hurries off at the sight of a disapproving COP.

     POLARIZE to show SCHUYLER through the bus window, exhausted, numbly
     taking in the glorious view.

     All seems quiet, the house dark-- late at night.  There's a 
     movement in the bushes near the street-- SCHUYLER emerges, on the 
     lookout for any surveillance.  It seems safe.  He digs out a hidden
     KEY from within a FAKE ROCK then goes to the front door, gathers up
     NEWSPAPERS and a thick stack of MAIL from his box.  He flips 
     through it quickly, finds a postcard that interests him and shoves
     it in his pocket-- the rest of the mail he leaves in the box.  He 
     punches in his code on the alarm pad, unlocks the door and enters. 

     CLOSE ON ALARM PAD-- the light goes from GREEN to RED.

     152.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER blinks as he enters the house-- the graffiti is gone, the 
     mess cleared up, it actually looks cleaner than ever. 

     QUICK SHOTS, JUMP-CUTS, the rhythm jarring.  LIGHTS LOW throughout,
     Schuyler wants to attract as little attention as possible... 

     152A(NEW). IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER gobbles handfuls of dry cereal,
     grabs for anything he can find in the refrigerator. 

     153. IN THE SHOWER, Schuyler scrubs away the grime.

     154. IN THE BATHROOM, he inserts a CONTACT LENS. 

     154A. IN A DESK DRAWER he finds a few $20.00 bills. 

     154B. IN THE BEDROOM-- Schuyler changes into jeans and a sport
     jacket, tucking the MONEY and the POSTCARD into the pockets.  As he
     turns to leave, he spots something on his dresser-- 

     A WHITE ENVELOPE, with a handwritten "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN..."

     SCHUYLER frowns at this. tears it open. reacts with fear...

     155. IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER holds the handwritten note to the 
     BLUE FLAME.  He tosses the BURNING PAGE into the sink. 

     CLOSE SHOTS on the curling, burning note, we make out KEY WORDS: 

     "MY FATHER WAS RIGHT," "NO REASON TO CONTINUE," "TAKE MY OWN LIFE,"
     "I WANT ONLY DEATH..." and finally the signature, "SCHUYLER VAN
     ORTON..."  This suicide note is no joke. 

     SCHUYLER backs away from the sink.  Quiet, determined:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No.  Fuck you... I'm going to live...

     156.  I N T .   S T U D Y  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler moves to a bookshelf, looking for a volume, finds--

     CLOSE-- a large, leather-bound BLACK BOOK with no title. 

     SCHUYLER clutches the volume.  HEADLIGHTS shine in the window, a
     VEHICLE in the drive.  Schuyler moves for a back door.

     157.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     A CAR DOOR CLOSES, we see a UNIFORMED FIGURE MOVE O. S., revealing 
     A POLICE STYLE CREST, the words "CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL SECURITY,"
     the initials "CRS" in the center. 

     SCHUYLER, sneaking around the side of the house, takes this in,
     waiting for the RENT-A-COPS with FLASHLIGHTS and WEAPONS to enter
     his house.  Then he hurries away, book under his arm.

     UNDER A STREET LAMP on a hilly street, SCHUYLER reaches into his
     pocket and squints at THE POSTCARD-- 

     INSERT POSTCARD, the message side:  "S - IT'S SAFE HERE - D."  An 
     ARROW points to a printed ADDRESS.  Schuyler FLIPS the card over--
     a PAINTING of a COLONIAL MANSION down a tree-lined DRIVE...

     THE SAME VIEW of the same mansion, a very beautiful, peaceful spot.
     SCHUYLER moves down the drive toward the entrance.  He carries the
     thick book, as he will through following scenes.

     A NURSE leads Schuyler down a door-lined corridor, no one in sight.
     This place turns out to be an incredibly ritzy SANITARIUM. 

                             NURSE 
                     The medication seems to be helping. 
                     Unfortunately we're going to have to
                     transfer your brother to a public 
                     institution in a few days, his funds 
                     are entirely exhausted-- unless you're
                     prepared to take responsibility...

     She KNOCKS at a door, OPENS IT a crack and lets Schuyler in.

     160.  I N T .   S A N I T A R I U M   R O O M  -  D A Y 

     A pleasant bedroom, and safe-- no sharp objects or primary colors 
     in sight, discreet decorative BARS on the window. 

     DAVID, in pajamas, sits in a chair, eating bland food from a 
     plastic lunch tray.  He watches a GOLF MATCH on a tiny WATCHMAN TV,
     we'll hear it IN BG-- CLAPPING, etc.  He doesn't react as Schuyler
     enters, moves to his side. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     David... 

     David turns to him, half-smiles; food particles on his lips. 

                             DAVID
                     Hello Sky...

     Schuyler sits close to David, upset. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What are you doing here? 

                             DAVID 
                     Sorry, I was just eating...  I'm
                     much better.  Really. 

     David does seem in control now, if a little hazy. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Thank God... Listen, I know you put
                     them onto me-- but I understand, 
                     we're both victims of this thing...
                     They've stolen everything we ever
                     had, they're trying to drive us both 
                     crazy-- but we won't let them. 
                     We'll find a way.  There's gotta be 
                     a way to beat these bastards!  We're
                     in it together...

     He clutches his brother's hand.  David narrows his eyes, confused. 

                             DAVID 
                     In what together? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     The game. 

                             DAVID 
                     Oh, Schuyler, there is no game.  It
                     was just a fantasy of mine, a self-
                     aggrandizing delusion... I can't 
                     believe you took that shit seriously. 

                             SCHUYLER
                       (clutching his hand)
                     No, David-- please... 

                             DAVID 
                         (pulling away) 
                     Oh, man, stop fucking with me! 
                     You know the game doesn't exist...
                     it never did!  It never did...

     Schuyler stares at him for a beat-- no getting through.  David
     leans forward, turns UP THE TV VOLUME, aiming the set at Schuyler. 

                             DAVID
                     Can you see? 

     ON SCREEN-- a golf ball rolls on a green and PLOPS into the cup.

     Barnett, the detective from earlier, has come out to the reception 
     area to speak with Schuyler, who's trying very hard to be rational. 

                             BARNETT 
                     So the waitress was in on it--

                             SCHUYLER 
                     She isn't really a waitress. 

                             BARNETT 
                     --and now you're brother's been 
                     institutionalized... is there a history
                     of mental illness in your family? 

     SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the question.  GALLO, beyond a METAL
     DETECTOR in the rear area of the station, gestures to Barnett, who
     holds up a finger. 

                             BARNETT 
                     'Scuse me. 

     Moving away, Barnett glances at the leatherbound book, which
     Schuyler clutches very possessively. 

                             BARNETT 
                     Whatcha reading? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Nothing. 

     Barnett purses his lips, nods, steps around the metal detector to
     chat with Gallo. 

     WITH GALLO AND BARNETT 

                             GALLO 
                     I just spoke with his lawyer 
                     Plympton, he thinks Van Orton's
                     having a nervous breakdown, we 
                     should probably hold onto him till 
                     his people can get down here...

     WITH SCHUYLER as GALLO AND BARNETT glance in his direction, gesture
     for him to approach.  Gallo WINKS casually at Schuyler. 

     SCHUYLER, wary now, moves toward them through the METAL DETECTOR--
     which GOES OFF with a WHINE.  The ALARM MONITOR woman approaches
     with a wand-- but Schuyler steps back, wide-eyed. 

                             ALARM MONITOR
                     Probably just your keys, sir-- 

     SCHUYLER turns and moves quickly for the exit. 

                             BARNETT
                     Yo, Schuyler, wait up-- 

     He's through the door.  The WHINE OF THE DETECTOR continues as we--

     THE WHINE dissolves into the SCREECHING of a TRAIN on an EL TRACK.

     163.  I N T .   B A R T   T R A I N  -  N I G H T 

     LIGHTS FLICKER on and off in a moving train car. 

     SCHUYLER scribbles intently in a brand new kid's school notebook, 
     open in his lap.  He sits at the end of the moderately crowded 
     train car.  Suddenly, he looks up, eyes wild, starts SCANNING the 
     subway car slowly, sensitive to it all.  By now he's definitely the
     sort of person you'd avoid in a public place. 

     INTERCUT POV with his REACTIONS, as everything falls into place in
     his increasingly febrile mind...

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- SLOW PAN OVER the assortment of nighttime RIDERS--
     a couple of TEENAGERS, an OLDER WOMAN with shopping bags, a DRUNK. 

     CAMERA PAUSES on a patch of GRAFITTI:  typically unreadable SCRAWL,
     but the letters could be CRS. 

     CAMERA MOVES to the overhead ADVERTISEMENTS:  one for hemrnorhoids,
     a seasonal bank ad featuring the EASTER BUNNY... PAUSE ON a PHOTO
     of an ecstatic CALIFORNIA LOTTERY WINNER holding up a wad of cash
     with the words "YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU DON'T PLAY."

     A MAN READS the SPORTS PAGE:  "GAME FINAL 23-2." 

     ON THE FLOOR, a CANDY BAR WRAPPER with A GOLD KEY printed on it,
     part of a contest. 

     SCHUYLER picks this up, examines and discards it. 

     SCHUYLER' S POV-- an ELDERLY MAN with a clunky HEARING AID is 
     looking at Schuyler with a blank expression.  The man suffers from
     a facial TWITCH that causes one eye to BLINK rapidly. 

     SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the man, then looks away pointedly.
     He puts the notebook into A PLASTIC BAG.  Beneath it, cradled in
     his lap, is the mysterious black book.  He opens this carefully-- 

     CLOSE, the book is hollow.  Inside is an expensive HANDGUN. 

     WIDE SHOT from the next train car-- A FIGURE IN FG is staring
     through the scratched, fogged window AT SCHUYLER as he puts the
     leather book into the bag with his notebook...

     Schuyler is using the plastic bag and his jacket as a pillow, his 
     eyes closed.  Suddenly there's a KNIFE at his throat. 

                             PUNK
                     End of the line, man. 

     SCHUYLER starts; the PUNK keeps the knife on him.  He's a young,
     glassy-eyed junkie.  He wears a RADIO EARPLUG in one ear, a wire
     heading down to his waist.  Schuyler nods, starts studying the
     man's arms, heavily TATTOOED with crude cabalistic SYMBOLS. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Are the tattoos supposed to mean
                     something? 

                             PUNK 
                       (momentarily thrown) 
                     Yeah, they mean you're dead, you
                     don't gimme what you got. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                      (touches the punk's arm)
                     OK, there's the C... 

                             PUNK 
                     Give me the fucking bag! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (cold, deadly) 
                     Come on, you're not going to put 
                     me through all this shit and then
                     kill me on a fucking train, it
                     won't look like a suicide... 

     As Schuyler speaks he sits up, the PUNK grabs the bag-- Schuyler 
     grabs the guy's knife hand, they wrestle on the floor of the car,
     clawing at each other.  The punk drops the knife, it gets knocked
     beneath the seat, both men reach for it...

                             TRANSIT COP
                     Freeze assholes! 

     Schuyler and the punk look up to see a TRANSIT COP pointing his
     WEAPON.  The punk throws his hands up, scrambles to his feet-- 

                             PUNK 
                     Psycho pulled a knife on me! 

     The cop has grabbed the still prone Schuyler, flipping him over and
     slapping a handcuff on him-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What do you think you're doing,
                     this guy attacked me! 

     The cop has dropped his guard; the punk spins and bolts into the
     next car, squeezing through the door.  The TRANSIT COP hastily
     cuffs Schuyler to an armrest-- 

                             TRANSIT COP
                     Wait here--

     He dashes into the next car after the punk.  Schuyler looks at the
     floor of the car, sees-- 

     THE SMALL RADIO and its EARPLUG attached by a WIRE.  The radio has
     a tiny LOOP/RABBIT EAR antenna on it.  He snatches it up, then
     YANKS at the cuff.  He spots the knife under the seat, grabs it,
     starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post.

     FROM THE NEXT CAR he hears SHOUTS, SCREAMS, a serious commotion
     going on, he doesn't know who's winning.  Schuyler's almost gotten
     free as the TRAIN SLOWS, when-- 

     --the DOOR at the far end of the car opens, it's the PUNK, bruised
     and bloody, ready to kill. 

     He lunges at Schuyler just as he PRIES THE ARMREST off the seat and
     CLOBBERS him with it.  The punk reels back.  The train has stopped,
     the doors have opened-- Schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out
     onto the platform just before they shut again. 

     166.  I N T .   B A R T   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER locks the free cuff on to the same wrist as the other,
     sliding his jacket over them, moving briskly up the stairs. 

     167.  E X T .   B E R K E L E Y   S T R E E T  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER emerges and walks quickly, checking over his shoulder,
     BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN.  He fiddles with the RADIO, the
     PLUG to his ear.  We hear STATIC, BLEEPING NOISES, FILTERED VOICES.
     For a few moments the VOICES ON THE RADIO become CLEARER. 

                             RADIO VOICE #1 
                     --can't let him get away with this,
                     he's outta control!  The next thing
                     you know, he'll push the wrong
                     button and we'll all be dead-- 

     SCHUYLER listens intently, leaning against a wall in the shadows,
     breathing hard.  He stares nervously at a couple of nearby STREET
     PEOPLE huddled by a shopping cart, they stare back.  Another VOICE
     on the radio talks OVER the first: 

                             RADIO VOICE #2 
                     --Whoah whoah whoah-- OK the guy's a
                     moron, sure, but he doesn't have the 
                     balls to end the world!  Anyway I'm
                     sicka talking politics, let's get back
                     to the business of nipple piercing--
                     you got a ring, don't ya Robin? 

     We hear the HYSTERICAL GIGGLING of ROBIN QUIVERS.  SCHUYLER blinks,
     recognizing the voice of RADIO DJ HOWARD STERN. 

                             RADIO VOICE #2 (HOWARD STERN)
                     Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this is
                     the Howard Stern show...

     SCHUYLER fiddles frantically with the dial and antennas, calling up
     RANDOM RADIO MUSIC, COMMERCIALS, etc.

     CLOSE ON A TRASH CAN-- Schuyler tosses his hollowed leather book
     into it.  It falls open, we see the gun is gone. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     168(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I C E  -  D A Y 

     TRACK DOWN an institutional corridor, a few EMACIATED PATIENTS in
     wheelchairs... they only come here to die.  ELIZABETH, Schuyler's
     ex, 4Oish, fit and attractive, a few months pregnant, READS to a
     couple of sad PATIENTS in a lounge area.  She trails off as she
     looks up, astonished to see-- 

     SCHUYLER, bruised, frightened, almost looking like he belongs here. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Hello Elizabeth...

     168A(NEW).  I N T .   S P O R T S   C A R  -  D A Y 

     Elizabeth backs out of a parking lot in a 3OO-ZX CONVERTIBLE and
     pulls into traffic, Schuyler beside her, babbling emotionally. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm sorry, I shouldn't be 
                     bothering you-- you're a genuinely
                     good person, your work is 
                     important, it's real, nothing that
                     happens to me is real anymore-- 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     What has happened to you, Sky? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I need your help, you're the only 
                     one left, the only one I can trust--
                     not that I deserve your help, God 
                     how could you have even married me,
                     I was a shit to you-- 

                             ELIZABETH
                     No you weren't-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yes I was.  Sometimes I think I'm
                     being punished for my sins, I
                     mean, there has to be a reason...

                                                       CUT TO:

     169.  I N T .   B R E A K F A S T   P L A C E  -  D A Y 

     ELIZABETH FLIPS THE PAGES of Schuyler's notebook-- page after page 
     of psychotic-looking scribbling, dense UNDERLINES, many EXCLAMATION 
     POINTS.  ON ONE PAGE-- "CRUEL RANDOM SHIT." 

     WIDER-- a few BUSINESS PEOPLE read papers, pick at eggs; A LARGE-
     SCREEN TV plays MORNING PROGRAMS.  Schuyler stares at Elizabeth,
     awaiting reaction... she seems incapable of speech.  He puts the
     tiny radio and earplug on the table between them. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This is one of their devices, I
                     pulled it off their assassin in
                     the subway.  It's how they 
                     communicate with each other. 

     Elizabeth picks the thing up, studies it, puts the plug to her ear. 

                             ELIZABETH
                     It's... a radio... 

     Schuyler waves dismissively, "you don't understand," takes the
     radio back from her and pockets it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I can't find the right channel...
                     Listen, I may not make it through 
                     this-- if anything happens, get that
                     notebook to, to, the press, or the
                     FBI or something.  Someone you can 
                     trust, I don't know, assuming you can
                     trust anyone.  I just want you to 
                     know I'm not crazy, and I didn't kill
                     myself, no matter what they say-- 

     She stares at him, trying to be strong, but she's very freaked out.
     A BARMAID brings their order.  Schuyler stares at the barmaid
     suspiciously as she puts a cup of coffee before Elizabeth, and
     gives him a bottle of water and a glass.  He tests the seal.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Has this been opened? 

                             BARMAID 
                     No sir.  Just like you said. 

     He watches her as she retreats, leans toward Elizabeth, puts his
     hand on top of her cup. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't think coffee is safe. 

     Schuyler opens the bottle and drinks straight from it thirstily.
     Elizabeth registers the CLINKING HANDCUFFS on his left wrist. 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Schuyler, try and listen to me.  I
                     love you, I always have, I always
                     will.  And maybe this is... good.
                     Maybe this a point you had to
                     reach, before-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                         (staring at her)
                     Before what? 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Before-- I'm just glad you came to
                     me for help.  I don't know if I'm
                     strong enough to, to handle this
                     on my own but I know a lot of
                     excellent crisis people-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Crisis people.  Crisis people?

     A CELL-PHONE RINGS in her purse, she makes an exasperated noise and
     pulls it out, with a "one sec" gesture at Schuyler.  He rises 
     during her conversation, a new look on his face-- he can't trust
     her either. 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Hello?  Hi, hon, I'm OK... um,
                     could I call you back...?

     Schuyler's distracted by something on the TV... he lets out a
     STRANGLED CRY.  Elizabeth turns her head to see. 

     ON TV SCREEN-- It's JIM FEINGOLD, clutching his head, rubbing his
     temples with a look of pain.  CHEESY MUSIC, THROBBING SPFX. 

     SCHUYLER approaches the set, shouting at it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You bastard!  You fucking bastard!
                     How did you find me here!? 

     Elizabeth gets up, tries to pull him back to the booth, he pushes
     her away, not taking his eyes from the set.  PATRONS react
     nervously to the deranged man. 

                             FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)
                     Ooof-- my head is killing me! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fuck you! 

     THE TV IMAGE WIDENS, a COMMERCIAL ACTRESS rubs Feingold's neck.

                             SCHUYLER
                     Who are you? 

                             ACTRESS (ON TV, filter)
                     Honey, have you taken anything? 

                             FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter) 
                     Sure, some aspirin-- 

     The actress CLUCKS her tongue, shakes her head.

     SCHUYLER's starting to get the picture.

                             SCHUYLER
                     He's an actor... 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Of course he's an actor, it's a commercial. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (a revelation) 
                     He's just a fucking actor... 

     ON TV-- Feingold holds up a colorfully marked bottle of pills,
     studies them with a shit-eating grin.  SOOTHING MUSIC.

                             FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)
                     My head feels great!  Thanks to 
                     Ambutol, I'll never use aspirin again! 

     FEINGOLD gives way to the image of A BOX OF AMBUTOL. 

     SCHUYLER lets Elizabeth escort him back near the booth.  He's
     completely absorbed in his own thoughts. 

                             ELIZABETH
                     Have you taken something? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What? 

                             ELIZABETH
                     Are you on drugs?

     He shakes his head, waves his hand dismissively.  He's thinking
     about something else.  Elizabeth starts dialing. 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Schuyler, I'm calling a friend 
                     right now, I want you to wait here
                     with me until-- 

     Schuyler tries to sound normal, claps her on the arm.  WHILE HE
     TALKS, CAMERA FINDS Schuyler's other hand, which slips stealthily 
     into her PURSE, lying on the seat of the booth. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Elizabeth, please... I'm sorry, 
                     I'II be alright, it's just been a
                     hard day... Listen, I gotta use
                     the restroom, be right back-- 

     He moves quickly down a corridor marked RESTROOMS and EMERGENCY 
     EXIT.  She looks after him, quite puzzled, phone still to her ear. 

     170.  E X T .   R E S T A U R A N T   P A R K I N G   L O T  -  D A Y 

     Schuyler emerges from a back exit, looking behind him, the 
     EMERGENCY ALARM SOUNDING.  He twirls Elizabeth's car keys on his
     finger as he jogs toward her sports car.  He unlocks it and the
     ALARM SCREAMS for a moment before he figures out how to shut it
     off, then he starts it and PEELS OUT.

     173.  E X T .   C H I N A T O W N  -  D A Y 

     Elizabeth's car zips through traffic in a Chinatown neighborhood 
     full of festive restaurants and shops.

     SCENE 174 DELETED

     175.  E X T .   T U N G   H O Y  -  D A Y 

     Hanging red ducks in the window, a SIGN with a phone number in the 
     window:  "TUNG HOY-- WE DELIVER" in English and Chinese.  SCHUYLER
     argues with an OLD CHINESE WOMAN behind the counter-- 

     175A(NEW).  I N T .   T U N G   H O Y  -  D A Y 

     A cramped, funky restaurant, rows of CELEBRITY HEAD SHOTS on a wall
     behind the delivery counter.  SCHUYLER pursues the CHINESE WOMAN as
     she serves bowls of noodles to a CHINESE FAMILY. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     He's an actor, does TV 
                     commercials, I know he's ordered 
                     from you, he had food delivered to
                     an office building on Mission-- 

                             CHINESE WOMAN 
                     Many customers, very busy, I don't
                     know, I don't know--

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Damn it! 

     Schuyler stalks away from her, finds himself facing the wall of 
     signed photographs--

     ON WALL, old and stained pictures, the most famous being the likes
     of ED McMAHON and CHARO.  Among them is a newer HEAD SHOT of 
     FEINGOLD with a shit-eating grin... below, the name WILLIAM FISHER. 

     SCHUYLER leaps on the counter and tears the photo off the wall-- 

                             CHINESE WOMAN 
                     Stop that, what you doing?! 

     Schuyler's already leapt off the counter, bolts out the door.

     175B(NEW).  I N T .   E L I Z A B E T H ' S   C A R  -  D A Y

     SCHUYLER is on the CARPHONE, glances from the road to-- 

     THE OBVERSE OF THE HEAD SHOT in his hand, a PHONE NUMBER before the 
     (short) list of credits, he flips it to show Feingold/Fisher. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     Yes, Mrs. Fisher, I know it's 
                     short notice but we were hoping 
                     your husband could come in for an
                     audition today, he's perfect...

     SCHUYLER looks annoyed at what he's hearing. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Isn't there any way we can get in
                     touch with him now...?  I see... 

     He makes a quick U-TURN, the tires SCREECHING.

     SCENES 176-179 DELETED

     180.  E X T .   Z O O  -  D A Y 

     Late afternoon.  PAN FROM THE ENTRANCE to find SCHUYLER buying a 
     ticket and hurrying in. 

     181. IN THE ZOO, Schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- ZOO-GOERS gazing at the ANIMALS... CAMERA FINDS 
     Feingold/Fisher, wearing casual clothes, eating a popsicle.  He's
     doing his best to supervise THREE OBNOXIOUS CHILDREN, two boys and
     an older girl.  He's just another dad at the zoo, far from 
     impressive-- the Wizard of Oz after the curtain's been pulled. 

     When he makes eye contact with Schuyler, he pales, trying to herd
     the children together as Schuyler moves in on him... he can't get 
     away.  Schuyler grabs the man's shirt. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Bill Fisher, hi!  I really admire
                     your work... 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Oh please... I got my kids here... 

     Schuyler releases him, Feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes.
     Schuyler casually shows him the gun, the man's eyes widen. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Get rid of them. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                          (to the kids) 
                     Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty!
                     Snack time!

     He dangles the bill over their heads, the KIDS CHEER, leap like
     dolphins after fish.  The girl's tallest, grabs the cash, they run
     for a nearby concession.  Schuyler and Feingold stroll together. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Look, buddy, it was just a job-- 
                     nothing personal, y'know?  I play
                     my part, improvise a little, 
                     that's what I'm good at, I still
                     do a little stand-up-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I've seen your resume.  I'm sick
                     of foot soldiers, I've gotta get
                     to whoever's in charge. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Of CRS?  Christ, nobody knows, nobody
                     gets the big picture--
                          (looking away) 
                     Jason, Tommy, cut it out! 

     FEINGOLD'S BOYS ARE THROWING ROCKS at the monkeys.  They give their
     father a look and saunter along. 

     SCHUYLER's not interested in the zoo drama. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Goddammit, why do they do that. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     How do I find them!?  Their
                     offices were abandoned-- 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     They own the whole building, they
                     just move from floor to floor. 

     Schuyler takes this in for a moment, thinking. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     OK... They know you, you've worked for
                     them.  You're going to get me inside. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                        (shaking his head) 
                     Uh-uh, I'm sorry and all, but-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Tell them anything, tell them the cops
                     are after you, you've gotta talk to
                     someone or you'll blow the whistle. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     No way, it's too dangerous.

     Schuyler cocks his head, steps in front of him.  Right in his face:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You don't seem to understand.  Right
                     here, right now-- I'm the danger. 

     Feingold gets the message. 

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     182.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  N I G H T 

     LIGHTS OFF in the building.  A battered STATION WAGON rounds a
     corner, PAUSES before the ramp to the garage entrance-- the same
     garage he and Christine were once tormented in. 

     183.  I N T .   S T A T I O N   W A G O N  -  N I G H T 

     FEINGOLD drives, looking very tense; a kiddie seat strapped next to
     him, junk galore; he's apparently alone. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     We're here, Sky.  They said they're on
                     the twelfth floor. 

     BEHIND THE SEAT-- Schuyler crouches under a blanket. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Drive in, then. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Look-- what are you gonna do?  Really? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Really-- I don't know.  Improvise.  Go! 

     183A.  I N T .   C R S   G A R A G E  -  N I G H T 

     The station wagon stops at the bottom of the ramp.  A BEEFY GATE
     GUARD behind glass glares at Feingold, who waves timidly.  The
     STEEL GATE RISES and the station wagon drives in. 

     THE STATION WAGON parks near an elevator bank; a handful of CARS, a
     few white CRS SECURITY VEHICLES and VANS parked nearby.  Feingold
     climbs out, trying hard not to look scared.  ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN 
     and a beefy, frightening-looking SECURITY MAN in a suit steps out.
     He looks around carefully as Feingold joins him.  He takes
     Feingold's arm and pulls him toward the elevator.  They wait.

     SCHUYLER'S POV from the back seat-- just as the DOORS OPEN, the
     Gate Guard steps up behind Feingold, puts a gun in his back. 

                             GATE GUARD 
                     You're not authorized to be here. 

     HE FIRES-- Schuyler glimpses a SPRAY OF BLOOD, Feingold collapses.
     The Security Man grabs the body as it falls, starts dragging it out
     of sight while the Gate Guard puts a hand to his ear, talks into a
     mini-transmitter in his other hand.  He follows the Security Man
     out of sight.  The elevator doors remain open. 

     With the guards out of sight, Schuyler rises slowly.  He looks
     stunned and sickened as he lets himself out cautiously, sneaking 
     behind vehicles.  The main gate is sealed, he has no idea how long
     the guards will be gone.  THE OPEN ELEVATOR DOORS beckon. 

     Schuyler crawls on his belly the last few yards, starts, finding--

     CLOSE, a RUBBER BUG on its back. 

     SCHUYLER creeps military style, on hands and knees, the rest of the 
     way to the elevator.  He puts a hand in some of Feingold's BLOOD,
     winces, then gets in the elevator. 

     184.  I N T .   C R S   E L E V A T O R  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER presses the button for 12-- the top floor. 

     ON PANEL-- nothing happens, the button LIGHTS for an instant but 
     GOES OUT again.  The elevator won't move.

     SCHUYLER's getting exasperated. 

     ON PANEL-- he tries BUTTONS allover, same story. 

                             GATE GUARD
                     Yo! 

     ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the gate guard jogs TOWARD the elevators,
     pulling his gun. 

     SCHUYLER starts to panic, pulls his own gun and POINTS IT AT THE
     GUARD, who freezes and raises his hands.  Behind him, the Security
     Man approaches Schuyler from a different angle, his gun out. 

     Schuyler can't get a bead on both of them. 

                             SECURITY MAN
                     You're a dead man. 

     Schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel-- 

     AT BASE OF PANEL, a gold keyhole.  CLOSER-- the letters CRS are
     printed beneath it, very small. 

     SCHUYLER shakes his head-- it couldn't be; but what else can he do?

     ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the guards are fanning out and getting closer. 

     SCHUYLER reaches with one hand for his keys, fumbling for the small 
     gold key he received at the start of the game. 

     ON PANEL-- his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key... it
     fits into the hole; he turns it and PUSHES THE BUTTON for 12. 

     WIDER-- as the DOORS CLOSE, both guards train their guns-- but too
     late.  Schuyler's on his way up. 

     184A. THE GLASS ELEVATOR RISES through completely blackened spaces. 

     SCHUYLER stares at a BULLET HOLE in the back of the glass elevator,
     a remnant of Feingold's murder.  He holds the gun in front of 
     himself in both hands... then he closes his eyes, steeling himself,
     almost in an attitude of prayer. 

     185.  I N T .   A T R I U M  -  N I G H T 

     PITCH BLACK but for the LIT ELEVATOR ascending swiftly through the
     darkness... Schuyler, like a solitary spaceship pilot, looks upward
     toward his unknown destination. 

     186.  I N T .   C R S   E L E V A T O R  -  N I G H T 

     The DIGITAL READOUT slows as it comes to 10, 11 and STOPS at 12. 

     SCHUYLER comes out of his trance, slips the revolver back into his 
     jacket pocket, keeps a hand there, and stands against a wall of the
     elevator as the DOORS OPEN ON-- 

     187.  I N T .   1 2 T H   F L O O R   C O M M I S S A R Y  -  N I G H T 

     --A BUSTLING, NOISY COMMISSARY.  Schuyler keeps the gun concealed
     as he steps out of the elevator-- nobody here is paying any 
     attention to him anyway.  There's a cafeteria style counter along
     one wall, people CHATTING and LAUGHING at Formica tables... amongst
     others, everyone from his game appears to be here... there's the 
     RASTA, the PARAMEDICS with the HEART ATTACK VICTIM, JOHN and PETE
     from the men's club, the GIRL from the boat, the DESK CLERK and 
     BELLHOP... also the HONDURAN TRUCK DRIVER, the SECURITY PEOPLE from
     his house, the PUNK and the TRANSIT COP... and a lot of ENGINEERS. 

     SCHUYLER inches into the room, meets the eyes of-- 

     CHRISTINE, who's just come away from the cafeteria counter with a
     tray of food.  She nearly drops it, looks over her shoulder to see
     if anyone is watching.  Suddenly, Schuyler is in front of her, 
     backs her into an alcove-- she holds the tray between them as if to
     protect herself.

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What are you doing here? 

     For a moment, Schuyler's not sure.  His voice is flat, monotonal:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm back from the dead. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Listen, everything's OK, nobody 
                     touched your money, nobody stole a
                     thing, that's impossible-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't give a fuck about the money,
                     I wanna know who's behind this, who 
                     did this to me, how, why-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     It's just a game! 

     Even though she's keeping a surface cool, he notices the GLASS and
     SILVERWARE on her tray RATTLING.  She starts to move toward a
     table, he blocks her path. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're not going anywhere. 
                     Feingold, or or Fisher, was that
                     just a game too? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What are you talking about?

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I watched him die...

     Schuyler shows her his BLOOD-STAINED HAND.  Christine looks utterly
     perplexed, then shrugs, finding a place to put down her tray. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Seemed like a nice guy, actually,
                     father of three-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Well, look, I'm sure it's just
                     another stunt-- that can't be 
                     real, taste it.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You taste it, you fucking vampire. 

     He pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then
     puts a finger to her ear as-- 

     THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and the guard and security man from
     downstairs burst into the commissary. 

     Suddenly the ROOM QUIETS, many others are touching their ears. 

     They all TURN in the direction of Schuyler and Christine.  The gate
     guard gestures at Schuyler, attempting a smile. 

                             GATE GUARD 
                     Could you come with us, please? 
                     You're not authorized to be here. 

     Schuyler grabs Christine, wraps an arm around her throat, puts his
     GUN to her neck. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Back off.  Everybody back off. 

     He uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally
     toward the nearest door, she CHOKES and GASPS.

     188.  I N T .   S T A I R W E L L  -  N I G H T 

     The door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead UP.

                             SCHUYLER
                     Shit, how do we get out-- 

     Christine STOMPS his foot and ELBOWS his gut, breaks free and bolts
     up the stairs.  Schuyler catches his breath and pursues.  Beneath
     him, the stairwell door opens, GUARDS PURSUE. 

     189.  E X T .   C R S   R O O F  -  N I G H T 

     A HIGH LEDGE surrounds the roof on all four sides, a ROOF ENTRANCE
     at each side as well.  The NUMBER "636" is painted large for
     helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc.  A
     MUFFLED ALARM sounds as Christine bursts through the door, followed
     by Schuyler.  She spins, her back to the EDGE of the atrium, a 
     black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken GLASS SKYLIGHT, a
     white RAILING around it. 

     Schuyler SLAMS the door, a large number 1 painted on it in BLUE.
     He throws the HEAVY BOLT.  He and Christine circle each other 
     warily, his gun trained on her.  POUNDING from the other side,
     MUFFLED VOICES that can't be heard. 

     For the first time, Christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then
     clutches the railing. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Wait a minute.  What's that? 

     Schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child: 

                             SCHUYLER
                     It's my gun...

                             CHRISTINE 
                     We didn't give it to you?  Where did
                     it come from? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     A gun store. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     We searched your house! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Guess you fucked up again. 

     Christine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her
     hand to her mouth, speaks urgently. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     He's armed, he's got a real gun. 
                     Real Situation, real-- 

     Schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the EAR PIECE and
     HAND MIKE away from Christine, the wire tears her blouse open. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yeah, it's real all right. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Schuyler this is all fake, tricks,
                     it's all part of the game--

                             SCHUYLER
                     Stop it.  Every word out of your
                     mouth is a lie-- 

     Christine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     The key!!  They, we gave you a key
                     to the elevator!  Why would we do 
                     that?!  We wanted you to come up-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Of course you did.  So you could kill 
                     me or, or frame me for murder--

                             CHRISTINE
                     No, no, it's THE GAME!!  Blanks, 
                     squibs, high-tech special effects,
                     none of it's real!  Just open that
                     door and I'll show you! 

     Schuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I open the door and I die. 

     ON THE DOOR-- POUNDING DESPERATE, but the ALARM DROWNS out the
     sounds of VOICES on the other side. 

     SCHUYLER turns quickly as she takes a step towards him.  He points
     the gun at her again.  He looks ready to use it.  The following
     DIALOG overlaps and collides, growing AURAL CHAOS-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You move again I swear I'll kill
                     you, you bitch. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     THINK ABOUT IT!!  They followed you
                     every step of the way, the cab, in 
                     the trunk, we had a diver--

                             SCHUYLER
                     They?  We?

                             CHRISTINE
                     --the guy in Honduras, the cop on
                     the train, there was always a
                     safety net, always-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Shut up, shut the fuck up!! 

     AXES DENT the metal door, which BULGES. 

     He looks at the monitor in his hand, the one he tore from her body,
     putting it in his own ear, letting the rest of the device dangle. 

                             RADIO VOICE (filter)
                     --just hang in there, keep talking
                     him down, we're on our way-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     We've been trying to end it since
                     you got back, our people came to
                     your house, they tried to bring 
                     you in from the subway, you kept
                     running, you weren't supposed to
                     keep getting lost-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You just said you wanted me to 
                     come here-- you're making this up
                     as you go along! 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Please Sky, please.  Take a breath
                     and think about it! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Stop.  Fucking.  With my head! 

     Schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead, the gun TREMBLING
     in his hand.  Christine's regaining control.  Schuyler's mind
     whirls, he GROANS, almost crying as he considers for the first time
     that she might be telling the truth.  She steps closer.

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You're all right, it's OK, just relax... 

                             RADIO VOICE (filter) 
                     Are you there?  How's he doing?

                             CHRISTINE
                     Please... when you open the door, the 
                     game ends... just open the door... Bill
                     Fisher's out there, he's fine, nobody
                     got hurt.  Why would we do the crazy 
                     things we did, if it wasn't part of a
                     game?  We thought you knew that... 

     He looks at her, almost ready to lower the gun.  He raises his
     bloody hand to his lips, about to taste it. 

                             RADIO VOICE (filter) 
                     --we're at the North entrance, 
                     Number 2, just a few more seconds
                     and we'll nail him-- 

     Schuyler's eyes dart toward--

     ANOTHER DOORWAY, on the other side of the atrium, like the one
     that's bolted.  The number 2 is painted on it in RED.  The handle
     starts to TURN just as-- 

     --CHRISTINE LUNGES AT HIM to wrest the gun away. 

     SCHUYLER comes to his senses, struggling.  The GUN GOES OFF, the
     report should be DEAFENING. 

     He spins, points the gun at Door #2 and FIRES again, several times.
     THE ALARM STOPS-- SILENCE. 

     Christine STIFFENS, falls backwards onto the ground, clutching her
     BLOOD-DRENCHED stomach.  Schuyler just stares.  Dark blood SPILLS 
     from her mouth as she CHOKES in pain...

                             CHRISTINE
                     Oh God.  I blew it... we blew it...

     DOOR #2 OPENS and-- 

     DAVID steps through.  He wears a brightly colored, silly looking
     PARTY HAT, carries a magnum of CHAMPAGNE bearing a huge BOW that
     reads, "SURPRISE."  BLOOD PUMPS from HIS CHEST.  He DROPS THE
     BOTTLE, which SHATTERS... David collapses amidst the broken glass. 

     A BLOW OF THE AXE SEVERS the deadbolt and Door #1 flies open behind
     Schuyler.  FEINGOLD is the first of a group to come charging 
     through, he wears a TUXEDO with a ROSE in the lapel, holds the axe.

     SCHUYLER spins, points the gun at this axe-wielding man, then,
     utterly stunned, lowers it in disbelief. 

     FEINGOLD looks from Schuyler to the wounded Christine-- her agony
     is painful to watch.  He drops the axe with a CLATTER and runs to
     her side, kneels.  His voice CRACKS. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     You shot her!?  No!
                       (looking toward David) 
                     Qh God no... 

     THE GUARD and SECURITY MAN come out on the roof looking very
     disturbed, followed by the RASTA and a few OTHERS.  Many are
     dressed for a party now.  Feingold looks to their horrified faces. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     He fucking shot them!! 

                             RASTA 
                     I'll call an ambulance. 

     The Rasta dashes downstairs.  Schuyler backs away, drops the gun,
     staggers over to David.  He's GASPING for breath.  CRS EMPLOYEES 
     give the brothers a wide berth, move toward Feingold and Christine.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     David, David, no, no-- 

                             DAVID 
                     Oh God, Oh God, Sky, save me, I 
                     don't wanna die, I don't wanna-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're not gonna die.  I'm here,
                     you're not gonna die... 

     David's already DEAD, eyes wide, body limp. 

     WITH FEINGOLD and CHRISTINE.  He holds his colorful cummerbund over 
     her stomach to staunch the bleeding.  She CHOKES in pain.

                             FEINGOLD
                     Hang on, just hang on, you're
                     gonna make it-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     That stupid... 

     They stare over at Schuyler, registering David's death.  Schuyler
     is now drenched in his brother's blood, rocking him in his arms.
     Most of the assorted CRS people move to get out of the building
     before the cops show, MURMURING amongst themselves in fear. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Oh God.  I thought you could 
                     handle it.  All the tests... they
                     said you could handle it...

     CHRISTINE yells at Schuyler, unable to stand-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You fucking psycho, you piece of 
                     shit, how could you-- 

     SCHUYLER gently lowers his brother and rises, like a zombie now.
     The big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it,
     keeping it out of his reach. 

     Schuyler backs away from the body, starts to SHAKE, looks as if he
     really has lost his mind.  Feingold SOBS aloud.

                             FEINGOLD 
                     God, why-- there was no point.  It was
                     supposed to be fun...

     Schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded Christine-- who
     GASPS silent curses, beyond speech-- to David's body...

     He slowly turns to the Atrium pit directly in front of him.  He's
     strangely calm...

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fun... 

     SHIFT TO SLOW MOTION: 

     SCHUYLER moves for the edge of the atrium pit...

     THE OTHERS react in HORROR, SHOUT "NO!!", lunging TOWARD HIM...

     DAVID'S HEAD suddenly MOVES, he BLINKS...

     SCHUYLER leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit.

     CHRISTINE jumps to her feet, perfectly alert, a hand extended,
     SCREAMING, just as-- 

     SCHUYLER CATAPULTS HIMSELF INTO SPACE, and--

     DAVID SITS BOLT UPRIGHT. 

                             DAVID 
                     SKY, NOOOO!!

     SCHUYLER sees this, too late-- 

     HE AND DAVID make terrified, helpless eye contact across the void, 
     arms outstretched.  Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable
     error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an
     agonizing MOMENT. 

     THEN HE FALLS...  LEAVE SLOW MOTION.

     190.  I N T .   A T R I U M  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER CRASHES through the skylight, TUMBLING-- SPARKLING SHARDS 
     surround him like stars as he PLUNGES, SPINS, SCREAMING. 

     191. RAPID CUTS-- the CLOWN, CHRISTINE's face, SCHUYLER and DAVID
     as CHILDREN, HIS FATHER's head striking the landing.  These FLASH
     PAST so rapidly we can't quite process them. 

     192. INTERCUT WITH:  INCREASING DARKNESS, GROUND RUSHING CLOSER... 

     ON SCHUYLER'S FACE as he experiences the epiphany that comes before
     the end.  BRILLIANT ANGELIC LIGHT suddenly illuminates him, his
     eyes roll into his head, closing-- 

     ANGLE FROM ABOVE-- the LIGHTS are real, they've COME ON to show-- 

     SCHUYLER'S IMPACT-- he LANDS on his back, arms outstretched, eyes
     squeezed shut-- 

     --and is swallowed by an ENORMOUS INFLATED LIFESAVING CUSHION that
     covers the floor of the atrium. 

     SCHUYLER BOUNCES in the cushion a few times, gradually coming to a
     rest, harmless bits of BREAKAWAY GLASS showering down around him. 

     He doesn't move a muscle, his eyes still closed. 

     CLOSER ON HIS FACE... muscles twitch.  His eyes open. 

     HIS POV-- UP the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the 
     building around the atrium.  THE FULL MOON in the very center
     through the hole in the glass. 

     All the lighted GLASS ELEVATORS COME TO EARTH, packed with people.

     SCHUYLER stares upward, mouth open, motionless. 

     DAVID comes running from an elevator, leaps up onto the cushion and
     bounces over to Schuyler, a huge smile on his face. 

                             DAVID 
                     Hey, bro, how you doin'? 

     Getting no response, David hops closer, squats by Schuyler's side. 

                             DAVID 
                     Admit it, you weren't bored...

     SCHUYLER remains motionless, David's worried now, grabs his arm and
     starts shaking him.

                             DAVID 
                     Jesus.  Sky, c'mon Sky-- 

     SCHUYLER begins to LAUGH, a tremendous catharsis.  DAVID laughs
     too, greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet. 

     THE TWO BROTHERS clutch each other for support on the BOUNCING 
     surface, LAUGHING.  CRS EMPLOYEES have gathered around the cushion,
     CHEERING and APPLAUDING. 

     SCHUYLER wipes his eyes, shaking his head with amazement.  Then he
     hauls back and SLUGS DAVID in the jaw, sending him flying onto his 
     back on the cushion.  MORE CHEERS from the crowd, as if they were
     watching a boxing match. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     193.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  N I G H T 

     THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS from Handel's "Messiah" plays.  SCHUYLER and 
     DAVID enter together from the atrium, the CUSHION deflates behind
     them.  David licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw. 

                             DAVID 
                     You've been wanting to do that for
                     a long, long time, haven't you? 

     Schuyler half-smiles.  The SECURITY MAN unlocks Schuyler's 
     handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which Schuyler stares at. 

                             DAVID 
                     Like they'd really leave a loaded gun
                     lying around.  They went over the 
                     whole place with a metal detector, 
                     then packed that thing with blanks. 

     They turn a corner into the main lobby, Schuyler absently pockets
     the gun, looks up in wonder...

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- a SURPRISE PARTY:  A STEREO, STREAMERS and
     BALLOONS, a CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN, CAKE and FOOD.  CRS EMPLOYEES
     (mostly ordinary-looking office workers) CLAP and CHEER for
     Schuyler.  They wear PARTY HATS, blow PLASTIC HORNS. 

     SMILING PEOPLE eager to offer CONGRATULATIONS surround him.  He's
     pretty shaky, like a newborn calf.  JOHN and PETE shake his hand.

                             JOHN 
                     Good one, buddy, really had you
                     going, didn't we? 

                             PETE 
                     Wait'll you try level two...
                             (a wink)
                     Joke. 

     The RASTA SLAPS his back, Schuyler instinctively looks over his
     shoulder for a gag message.

                             RASTA 
                     That look on your face up there?
                     Shit, man, I almost lost it. 

     The RECEPTIONIST POPS a bottle of Dom Perignon, hands it to Sky. 

                             RECEPTIONIST 
                     Awesome game-- best I've seen. 

     Not knowing what else to do, Schuyler takes a slug.  The GIRL from
     the boat KISSES his cheek.  TECHNICIANS, men with STUNTS UNLIMITED
     T-SHIRTS, the NURSE from the asylum, the SECURITY PEOPLE, CRS
     GUARDS, AGENTS, all want a piece of him at once. 

     The "MESSIAH" FADES and an R & B BAND breaks into ROUSING MUSIC as
     Feingold approaches and sticks a CIGAR in his mouth, LIGHTS it. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Sure glad you jumped, compadre. 
                     Otherwise I was supposed to throw
                     you off. 
                           (whispering) 
                     It's not strictly legal, so don't 
                     tell anyone... 
                        (a beat, off Schuyler's look)
                     The cigar.  It's a Monte Cristo,
                     straight from Havana. 

     Christine approaches, wobbly and dazed herself; she touches his
     arm.  Her voice is soft for the first time, accents gone. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Hey... you all right? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (nods slowly)
                     I think so.  You? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Little shook.  I'm pretty much a
                     method actress, y'know? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What's your name? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Susan.  Susan Waters. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Nice to meet you, Susan...

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Can I have a puff? 

     He gives her a DRAG on his cigar.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, I have to know.  Who's
                     really in charge? 

     She shrugs, blows a SMOKE RING and sticks her finger through it.

                             CHRISTINE
                     God?

     She winks and strolls off.  Schuyler smiles, looking after her. 

     DANCING is starting up IN BG.  A clutch of non-CRS people approach
     tentatively-- including PLYMPTON, ELIZABETH, MARIA and JACK.  They
     all look very confused. 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     What is this, Sky?  We got a call
                     from your brother, said there was
                     a surprise party...

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Kind of late for your birthday,
                     isn't it? 

     Schuyler LAUGHS, gives her a hug, surprising her.  He still has a
     giddy smile plastered on his face. 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     If you wanted to borrow my car,
                     you could've just asked-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I know, Liz, I've been an idiot,
                     and I'm sorry...

                             PLYMPTON
                     You OK? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yeah-- I'm good, really.  Happy to 
                     be alive... Listen, it's great to 
                     see all of you, thanks for coming--
                     but there's something I have to do.
                     Excuse me. 

     He moves away quickly.

     SCENES 194-197 DELETED 

     198(NEW).  I N T .   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER FLUSHES and moves away from a urinal.  David waits a few
     feet away by the sinks and mirrors; Schuyler starts slightly. 

                             DAVID 
                     So what's the object of the game? 

                             SCHUYLER
                             (a beat)
                     What game? 

                             DAVID
                     Very good... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                       (rinsing his hands) 
                     Is it always like this? 

                             DAVID 
                     Mine was a little weirder.  Tell
                     you about it sometime. 

     David pulls out A COLORED ENVELOPE, slips it into Schuyler's shirt.
     Schuyler looks at him curiously as he dries his hands. 

                             DAVID 
                     The bill.  It's itemized.  Don't
                     bother opening it now...

                             SCHUYLER 
                           (opening it) 
                     I thought it was a gift. 

                             DAVID 
                     Well, no, the card was the gift,
                     the rest was up to you. 

     CAMERA FOLLOWS as David hurries out of the rest room, Schuyler
     behind him, flipping pages of a long, long bill--

     199(NEW).  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  N I G H T 

     --we rejoin the PARTY, which is now in full swing.  Schuyler stands
     alone at the periphery of the dance floor with the bill.  He hits
     the bottom line... he blinks and GASPS. 

     CHRISTINE appears, taking his hand and pulling him away. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What?  Where are we going? 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Does it matter? 

     They move into a stairwell and start climbing O. S., their hands
     all over each other.  We hear the MUSIC and FESTIVITIES continuing
     in BG. 

     CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on a SIGN painted on the wall with an arrow
     upward:  "LEVEL 2..."

     1.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (HOME MOVIES)

     A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAY BOY with a blindfold spins round and
     round, the HANDS of OTHER CHILDREN keep him spinning.  MAIN TITLE.
     It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.  The dizzy boy is given
     a strip of felt, and the CAMERA follows as he stumbles toward a
     large cardboard donkey.  He pins the tail on its nose.

     2. QUICK, RAGGED CUTS-- the BOY blows out candles... opens gifts...
     a CLOWN ties balloon animals.  CHILDREN, MAIDS and BUTLERS hover
     about; there's even a real-live PONY.  The party take splace in the
     gardens of a massive Pacific Heights MANSION.

     3. THE BOY is SCHUYLER VAN ORTON (7), and this is his birthday
     party.  He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he
     poses for a shot with his mother, MRS. VAN ORTON, a stiff-looking
     society matron.  A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places
     the baby in Schuyler's arms.  Schuyler is ultra-careful, over-
     whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny BROTHER (DAVID).

     4. THE BOY and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic
     show in the front GARDEN-- a MAGICIAN waves a colored handkerchief,
     a DOVE FLIES OUT.  CAMERA FOLLOWS the bird UP toward the house...

     5. THE CAMERA FINDS MR. VAN ORTON, a pinched, depressive man of
     about 40, wearing glasses.  He stands on a high balcony at the top
     story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette.  The
     unseen photographer ZOOMS IN jerkily on the man.  When he realizes
     he's being photographed, Mr. Van Orton turns his back and goes
     inside the house.  The film SOLARIZES and runs into LEADER--

                                                       CUT TO:

     6.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (PRESENT DAY)

     TITLES CONTINUE.  Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an
     ornate Victorian or Arts & Crafts).  The landscaping has changed,
     there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the
     carriageway, a black 500-class MERCEDES in the drive.

     MUSIC DOWN, SEGUE to a CNN NEWS BROADCAST OVER as the CAMERA MOVES
     IN ON THE UPPER BALCONY where we'd seen Mr. Van Orton earlier...
     it's now COVERED and GLASSED-IN.  We move THROUGH THE GLASS...

     7.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B E D R O O M  -  D A Y 

     TRACK THROUGH a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan,
     free weights, a treadmill.  Atop the bed a LAPTOP COMPUTER runs
     STOCK QUOTES.  A LARGE-SCREEN TV plays UNWATCHED, a familiar CNN
     ANCHOR (we'll assume BERNARD SHAW).  The Bang & Olufsen CLOCK RADIO
     CLICKS ON, 6:30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with the TV report.
     HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT TABLE,
     where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony. 

     END TITLES as we MOVE TOWARD a DOOR, it's open a crack-- from this
     adjacent bath we hear the SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING...

     8.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B A T H R O O M  -  D A Y 

     In the steam-filled bathroom, we make out SCHUYLER VAN ORTON, now
     38.  He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his
     world.  He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself
     and grabs the BATHROOM PHONE. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     Van Orton... Yes, it is my 
                     birthday, Bob, is that why you
                     called...?  Ah... No, I'm not 
                     carrying Alan Baer another inch, 
                     fuck him, BG Lumber is history... 

     As he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, Q-
     tips, etc.  (Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.) 

     9.  E X T.   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T S  -  D A Y 

     The black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic.

     10.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER is on his car phone, NEWS RADIO LOW in BG, maneuvering 
     aggressively through traffic.  His laptop RUNS in the passenger
     seat, its cellular antenna up. 

                             SCHUYLER (on carphone) 
                     Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know
                     me, of course I'm behind Baer- 
                     Grace a hundred per cent... great,
                     see you at the shareholders'
                     meeting next month... 

     He hangs up and HONKS at another driver, displaying no emotion.

     11.  I N T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 

     TRACK WITH SCHUYLER through an elegant suite of offices.  He passes
     a discreet sign: "THE VAN ORTON GROUP."  Schuyler is on a cell-
     phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by MARIA, his middle-aged
     secretary.  She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention. 

                             SCHUYLER (on cellphone) 
                     I've got buyers for the BG paper mill,
                     goose the lawyers, final papers in 
                     three weeks... sure it's sad, but an
                     old dog loses its teeth and pisses
                     itself, you put it to sleep... 

     As Schuyler walks, he's GREETED by passing UNDERLINGS, whom he
     ignores.  He SHUTS OFF the phone, Maria hands him a couple of
     items, follows him into his office. 

                             MARIA 
                     Carol from the museum called. 
                     She's sending architect's sketches
                     of the wing...

     12.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y 

     The office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money.  A window
     overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay. 

                             MARIA 
                     That Business Week reporter called again-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Tell him to fuck himself.  Nicely. 

                             MARIA 
                           (awkwardly) 
                     --and, um, somebody who identified
                     himself as, um, P.P. Willy. 

     SCHUYLER FREEZES at this, stares at her. 

                             MARIA 
                     Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but
                     he swore you'd know who he was.  He 
                     wanted to meet you for lunch, I told
                     him you had appointments all-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Cancel.  Cancel the whole afternoon. 

                             MARIA
                     But you-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Do it.  Did he leave a number? 

                             MARIA
                     No.  He just said he'd be at Leo's
                     in the Haight.  At noon. 

     Maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     That's all, Maria. 

     She heads out quickly.  Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to
     look out the window, lost in thought. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     13.  I N T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 

     A working class bar, an ALCOHOLIC or two, pinball machines. 
     SCHUYLER sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not
     his kind of place.  A WAITRESS arrives in a too-small uniform--
     young, multiple earrings, CHRISTINE according to her name tag. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Can I take your order? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I haven't seen the menu. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Oh, right.  Here, see ya. 

     She hands him a menu and starts off.  Schuyler calls after her. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     An iced tea, please-- 

     She waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back.  Schuyler 
     sighs and opens the menu.  Suddenly, someone BACKHANDS the side of
     his skull, he assumes a defensive posture.  Schuyler sees his
     LAUGHING brother:  DAVID VAN ORTON. 

                             DAVID 
                     Yo, Sky.  Happy birthday. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                       (rubs his head, annoyed) 
                     Thanks, "Pee-pee."  I never get
                     tired of that. 

     DAVID slides into the seat opposite him.  He's in his early 30's,
     good-looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring
     and a perpetual grin.  There's an intense, edgy quality to him
     which Schuyler has some trouble readjusting to. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Well... long time. 

                             DAVID 
                     Yeah, since Mom died-- what, five
                     years? So how you been? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Business as usual... 

                             DAVID 
                     How's Elizabeth?  Any kids? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     A little girl. 

                             DAVID
                     Congrat-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It's not mine, she married a
                     pediatrician in Sausalito. 

                             DAVID 
                     You're divorced... 
                        (off Schuyler's nod) 
                     Too bad, she was actually interesting. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     She stopped drinking, I guess 
                     getting rid of me was the 13th step. 

                             DAVID 
                     So you're all alone in the House of Pain. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I redecorated.  Where have you been? 

                             DAVID 
                     All over.  Nowhere in particular.
                     Didn't your fucking gumshoes keep 
                     you informed of my every movement? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I called them off two years ago, 
                     David.  You'd kicked the heroin, you'd
                     left the ashram, you were windsurfing
                     somewhere in Central America...

                             DAVID 
                     It's gorgeous down there... you
                     should go sometime. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, are you in trouble, is there
                     anything you need?  You can't have
                     gone through the trust fund... 

                             DAVID 
                         (looks at him, hurt) 
                     That's not why I'm here, Sky, I
                     just wanted to see you... I even
                     brought a gift, for a change. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You didn't bake me a cake, did you?

                             DAVID 
                     You can't still be mad about the
                     hash brownies... 

     Schuyler's unamused by the memory.  David grins and pulls a small
     envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him. 

                             DAVID 
                     Happy birthday, bro. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What is this. 

                             DAVID
                     It's a bomb.  Open it! 

     Schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out-- 

     A BUSINESS CARD in BLUE and ORANGE:  "CONSUMER RECREATION SERVICES." 
     The C, R and S are HIGHLIGHTED, a PHONE NUMBER at the bottom.

     SCHUYLER picks up the card, fingers it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Consumer Recreation Services.  OK...

                             DAVID 
                     I can't tell you very much about it,
                     that'd ruin the surprise.  Just 
                     promise me you'll give 'em a call. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't get it. 

                             DAVID 
                     Just call 'em.  OK look, it's simple,
                     really.  They entertain you. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Is this an escort service? 

                             DAVID 
                     No, it's nothing like that. 
                     They're a business, they're for
                     real... They guarantee just one
                     thing-- you won't be bored. 

     Schuyler gives him a bored, blank look.  David throws up his hands.

                             DAVID 
                     They make your life fun. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fun. 

                             DAVID 
                     You've heard of it. 

     Christine the waitress has shown up with Schuyler's iced tea.  She
     puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table.  Schuyler
     shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip
     into his lap.  Cracking gum: 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Sorry. 

     She moves off as Schuyler tries to order, raising a finger--

                             SCHUYLER
                     Just a cheesebur... how'd you find
                     this place?

                             DAVID 
                     Old connection used to meet me
                     here.  So you gonna call 'em? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (a sigh, carefully) 
                     You know, David, this is sweet, but 
                     it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the
                     midst of a delicate liquidation-- 

                             DAVID 
                       (mimicking him bitterly) 
                     "A delicate liquidation," God, you
                     would do this... 

                             SCHUYLER
                     David-- 

                             DAVID 
                     We can't get together once without 
                     you making me feel like shit.  That's
                     important to you, isn't it? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What are you talking about? 

                             DAVID 
                     Forget about it, don't bother. 

     David slumps in his seat, won't meet Schuyler's eyes. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Are you still on medication...? 

     David glares at him.  With the impeccable timing of all waitresses,
     CHRISTINE appears, chipper. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You guys know what you want? 

                             DAVID
                     Go away. 

     She curls her lip and departs before Schuyler can open his mouth.
     He sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating.  Calmly:

                             DAVID 
                     I just thought you'd like it.  I did,
                     it was a blast, best thing that ever
                     happened to me.  And for your 
                     information, I'm not on anything
                     anymore, I'm not even seeing a 
                     shrink, I'm in a better place than 
                     I've ever been, I'm even happy-- but
                     that's something else I wouldn't be
                     able to explain to you. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     OK, OK, I'll give them a call... 

                             DAVID
                     Whatever. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, take a pill.  Just be normal 
                     for thirty seconds and tell me what
                     this is.  I hate surprises. 

                             DAVID
                     I know. 

     David WINKS, puts a finger to his lips-- not another word.

                             SCHUYLER
                     Van Orton. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     Hello, Schuyler. 

     ELIZABETH is Schuyler's ex-wife-- an earnest woman, a stranger to
     subtlety.  STAY WITH SCHUYLER, who half-smiles, looks at his watch. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Eleven forty, you almost didn't
                     make it. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     I always call on your birthday.
                     How was it? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh, the usual, big party, circus
                     clowns, naked lady in a cake... 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                       (slight chuckle; serious)
                     How are you, Sky? 

     She has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person,"
     someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out.
     Schuyler GRIMACES, then mimics the tone: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm just fine.  How are you? 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     It wasn't a trick question. 
                     Thirty-eight, I thought that might
                     be a-- a difficult year for you... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Hm?  Just another birthday, 
                     another year closer to death. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     I meant-- because of your father. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh that's right, I guess he was 38,
                     wasn't he?  I hadn't thought about 
                     it, to tell the truth, but thank you
                     for the reminder. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     Why do I call you... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I honestly don't know, but it's a
                     nice change of pace from talking
                     to your attorneys.  So, still
                     working at the hospice? 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     Mm-hmm, couple days a week... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Great, that's great.  Well, give my
                     regards to Dr. Mel and the baby-- 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     She has a little brother on the 
                     way... we just did the ultrasound. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Really.  Congratulations-- two 
                     kids, an official nuclear family,
                     you must be very happy. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     We are, Sky.  Very happy. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Well, you deserved someone who 
                     wanted the same things you did-- 

                             ELIZABETH
                     Are you?  Happy? 

     SCHUYLER hates this question.  He quickly changes the subject. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Speaking of little brothers, I saw
                     David today. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker)
                     Really? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     He asked about you.  He's on a new 
                     kick, some personal improvement cult.
                     I'm gonna check it out, I'm sure he's
                     getting fleeced again. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     Who knows, maybe it'll be good for 
                     you.  Send David my love. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Right.  Well, thanks again for
                     calling, Elizabeth, take care. 

                             ELIZABETH (on speaker) 
                     You too, Schuyler-- I mean that-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mm, good luck, bye. 

     He PUNCHES off the phone in the middle of her "Good-bye."  Schuyler
     returns to his work, as if the call hadn't taken place-- but a few
     seconds later, we see his concentration is completely shattered, he
     leans back in his SQUEAKING deskchair.

     A LIMOUSINE pulls into the ungated carriageway.  THE BACK DOOR 
     OPENS and SCHUYLER (7) emerges from the backseat, carrying 
     elementary schoolbooks.  As he approaches the front steps, he looks
     upward at something, blinks and squints. 

     ANGLE UP-- MR. VAN ORTON, in his robe, stands on the balcony 
     railing, looking up at the sky.  He turns his gaze slowly downward. 

     YOUNG SCHUYLER is puzzled, gives his dad a tentative wave.

     MR. VAN ORTON waves back, his eyes dead, expression blank. 

     YOUNG SCHUYLER opens his mouth to call to his father-- instead we
     hear an URGENT ELECTRONIC BEEPING--

     A MICROWAVE OVEN BEEPS that the meal is "READY."  SCHUYLER opens

     ON A BIG-SCREEN TV, a CNN NEWSCAST shows a FIRE OUT OF CONTROL.
     MOVE FROM THIS through the manly, book-lined den.  The house is
     traditional, opulent, densely decorated with "good pieces"-- and it
     feels like a mausoleum. 

     FIND SCHUYLER peeling open the plastic food container.  He sits in
     a leather armchair.  A BOTTLE OF DOM PERIGNON sits on the coffee
     table, near a champagne flute glass, a CUPCAKE with a CANDLE in it.
     The LAPTOP computer is RUNNING.

     ON TV, BERNARD SHAW comes out of the story.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'll drink to that. 

     SCHUYLER raises his champagne glass to the TV, his birthday done.
     Then he toasts in the direction of a FRAMED PICTURE on the coffee
     table-- a WEDDING PHOTO OF SCHUYLER and ELIZABETH. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (TV) 
                     --up next, the latest in sports.
                     For all of us here at CNN, thank
                     you for watching-- 

     SCHUYLER reaches for the REMOTE CONTROL.  He settles back on the
     sofa, CHANNEL HOPPING.  He despairs of this quickly, points the
     remote at his own head-- CLICK, CLICK.  He closes his eyes. 

     24.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (FLASHBACK) 

     MR. VAN ORTON stands on the edge of the balcony, waving as before.
     He looks skyward one last time, then suddenly LAUNCHES HIMSELF INTO
     SPACE in a head-first dive.  We hear what sounds like a SCREAM--

     toward a postmodern building in the financial district; a ramp 
     leads to a parking garage beneath.  Casually dressed, he glances up
     at the facade for a few moments, then goes in.

     minor construction underway on the ground floor, scaffolding about.
     Schuyler crosses to a bank of lobby elevators.

     Partitioned work areas, terminals, clutter and disarray.  Office
     doors open off a reception area.  CRS EMPLOYEES move about
     hectically.  Schuyler enters, wanders about for a moment, confused.
     A friendly female RECEPTIONIST glances up from her desk. 

                             RECEPTIONIST
                     Can I help you? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Is this Consumer Recreation
                     Services?  I have an appointment, 
                     the name's Van Orton. 

     The woman flips through an appointment book with a logo, CRS.  IN
     BG, JIM FEINGOLD pays a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY for a BAG OF FOOD. 

                             RECEPTIONIST 
                     Hm... I don't seem to-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Schuyler Van Orton, I called last week. 

     The woman shakes her head.  FEINGOLD slows as he crosses past
     Schuyler, carrying the bag.  He's 30-40, a no-nonsense engineer,
     looks a bit dull, but he exudes competence and trustworthiness. 

                             FEINGOLD
                     Problem? 

                             RECEPTIONIST 
                     This gentlemen says he has an
                     appointment, but... 

     Feingold glances at Schuyler, shrugs. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Van Orton, huh?  I'll take him.
                        (shakes his hand) 
                     Jim Feingold, v. p. in charge of
                     engineering and data analysis. 

     The man leads Schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor, looks
     in a couple, then finds what he's after.  He snatches up a couple 
     of pages, hands them to Schuyler.  Then he finds a clipboard on the
     floor, tosses it to him like a frisbee. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Sorry about the chaos, we're still
                     in the process of moving...
                     follow me, I've got an office
                     around here someplace. 

     He reaches into a box of PENS, passes one to Schuyler.

     CLOSE ON PEN-- the CRS LOGO.

     very cool-looking.  Feingold moves behind the desk, unpacks a
     couple of white cartons. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     I can't remember the last time I ate
                     in a restaurant, all I do is work... 

     SCHUYLER sits on a couch, looking at the forms. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I know what you mean.  Look-- what
                     is all this? 

     The fast-talking Feingold moves energetically through the office,
     occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with 
     chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Application, MMPI and TAT tests,

                     The tests serve a threefold purpose.
                     First off, are you right for us? 
                     Are we right for you?  Unfortunately,

                     Let's back up here-- 

                             FEINGOLD 
                            (over him) 
                     B, we need an idea of your abilities
                     and limitations, what turns you on, 
                     and off.  Numero tres, our insurance
                     company requires it. 
                        (a beat, studying Schuyler) 
                     You're familiar with our service,
                     aren't you? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Not at all.  What are you selling? 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Well... it's a game. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     A game. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Recharges the batteries, gets you
                     off the treadmill, it's an 
                     experience.  Sort of a-- vacation 
                     for the guy who's been everywhere. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This really doesn't sound like my
                     sort of-- 

     Feingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and
     smiling condescendingly-- he raises a hand to stop Schuyler. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What's so amusing? 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Nothing.  I know who you are. 
                     You're David Van Orton's brother,
                     he got you in here. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     So. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                       (remembering fondly) 
                     David was-- impressive, one of the
                     better I've seen.  But frankly, I
                     can see you're not the type.

                             SCHUYLER
                     The type. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     You know, a player. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm not a player. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     I don't mean anything personal by it--
                     I know you're an important guy, 
                     powerful guy, you're used to being on
                     top.  It's just, this isn't for 
                     everyone.  Not everyone can handle it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                       (nearly losing it) 
                     What kind of fu-- game is this? 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     The ultimate fucking game.  I wish I
                     could tell you more, but it's
                     different every time.
                             (rising) 
                     Thanks for coming in-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (doesn't move) 
                     I'm not an idiot.  I see what you're 
                     doing.  First the vague yet intriguing
                     pitch, then I'm supposed to feel like
                     my manhood's in question because I'm
                     not up for, what, some motivational
                     role-playing fantasy nonsense-- 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Interesting, you don't know the first
                     thing about it but you've already
                     decided what it is... Listen, I
                     don't wanna waste any more-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get
                     shit.  I've got the afternoon 
                     free, I'll take your silly tests.

     Feingold cocks his head, reappraising him.  Then, with a smile, he
     calls to an attractive young WOMAN passing in the hall; Schuyler,
     meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Ms. Nelson, are you busy?  We need
                     someone to run Mr. Van Orton. 

                             MS. NELSON
                     This way, sir... 

     As she leads Schuyler out the door, Feingold WINKS at him. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     I'll catch up with you after the physical. 

     Schuyler reacts-- a physical?  He throws up a hand and follows the
     woman into the hall.  Alone now, Feingold cracks a fortune cookie
     and glances at the slip of paper inside.  He furrows his brow with
     concern at the fortune-- then tosses it aside.

                                                       CUT TO:

     30. CRS OFFICES - SERIES OF SHOTS

     During the following QUICK CUTS, SOUNDS will be layered in and
     CONTINUE over one another, e. g. the SOUND of a scraping pencil,
     the BLIPS of machinery, HEAVY BREATHING, MURMURING VOICES of
     TECHNICIANS giving instructions...

     A. X-CLOSE:  A #2 pencil FILLS IN box after box on a long MMPI 
     form.  CLOSE on a couple of these:  "I sometimes hurt animals... I
     feel guilty when I masturbate..." each followed by TRUE and FALSE
     boxes. 

     B. A WHITE-WALLED ROOM:  Schuyler concentrates on a drawing held by
     a stone-faced PSYCHOLOGIST, a TAT test; he laughs as he speaks into
     a tape-recorder, analyzing the pictures. 

     C. X-CLOSE:  The DRAWING, a large ant with an apron feeding a TV
     dinner to a human child.  The card moves just as we register it to
     reveal another DRAWING of a smiling man toppling backwards in a
     chair, perched on the edge of a cliff. 

     D. A LAB:  Electronic MONITORS and PRINTERS record Schuyler's EEG
     and EKG.  We see him on a doctor's table, wearing a medical gown
     with the CRS logo.  He's hooked up to the wires, a female
     TECHNICIAN studying the readouts while a NURSE takes his blood
     pressure. 

     E. X-CLOSE:  The traveling trace of intersecting colored waves. 

     F. A DARKENED ROOM:  Schuyler in FG, still in the gown, watches a
     screen as images FLASH-- geometric SHAPES, WORDS, PHOTOS.  His
     finger hovers over a bank of three buttons, he presses different
     ones from time to time.  There's a MIRROR to one side of the room-- 

     G. X-CLOSE:  A COMPUTER SCREEN shows green columns of NUMBERS--
     SCHUYLER'S NAME is steady at the top of the screen, with an account
     number.  CAMERA MOVES FROM THE SCREEN to show an unseen COMPUTER
     OPERATOR watching Schuyler through the one-way glass. 

     The CACOPHONY of the MONTAGE ends abruptly as we CUT TO:

     31.  I N T .   C U B I C L E  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler, in the gown, sits on an examination table with his hands
     in his lap in a small, featureless cubicle-- he seems vulnerable, 
     looks around blankly.  To himself, irritated and bemused: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     David, you suck. 

     FEINGOLD BURSTS IN, a slew of COMPUTER PRINT-OUTS under his arm. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Sorry to keep you waiting, 
                     a client's head exploded...
                             (grins) 
                     You can get dressed, we're done. 

     He throws open a closet door.  Schuyler reaches inside for his
     clothes, which are neatly folded and on hangers.  Feingold turns
     his back on him as he DRESSES, perching on the examination table
     and studying the unburst print-outs. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Looks promising at this point. 
                     You test well, you're in decent
                     shape for someone in your tax 
                     bracket... Hm, some resistance to
                     the psych questions, but we got 
                     the general idea... 

     He heads out, beckons for Schuyler to follow. 

     32.  I N T .   C R S   M A I N   F L O O R  -  N I G H T 

     Feingold leads him through the office-- SECRETARIES and other 
     WORKERS pack up at the end of the day. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     We design the game around your 
                     schedule, you're free to give it
                     as much or as little time as you 
                     wish.  And of course, you can call
                     it quits at any point. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This was actually a gift.  Did my
                     brother pay in advance? 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     You'd have to ask our billing 
                     department... the price varies.  But
                     our service comes with a guarantee.
                     If you're not satisfied, there's no 
                     charge.  And we've never had an
                     unsatisfied customer... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You mean dissatisfied. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                        (looking at a form) 
                     Mm, that's right-- you're a left-
                     brain word fetishist. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I get that all the time. 

     Feingold smiles tightly and leads Schuyler back into his office.

     33.  I N T .   F E I N G O L D ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y 

     CLOSE ON PAPERWORK as it's dropped on the desktop. 

     SCHUYLER, CRS pen in hand, looks at this dubiously.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     So I'm supposed to sign up for a 
                     game when I don't know the rules,
                     I don't know the object, I don't
                     know how much it costs... 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     It's a leap of faith.  But at this
                     stage, there's no commitment-- we
                     just need to process your 
                     application.  And if you qualify,
                     you're in for the ride of your 
                     life.  What have you got to lose? 

     Schuyler CLICKS the ballpoint pen, they both lean over the papers. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Initials-- initials-- sign here. 

     Schuyler's about to sign when Feingold grabs his wrist. 

                             FEINGOLD
                     In blood. 
                             (a WINK)
                     ---Just kidding. 

     CLOSE, as Schuyler SIGNS on the dotted line. 

     FEINGOLD snatches up the forms, suddenly seems in a hurry for
     Schuyler to go. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Very good, Mr. Van Orton.  Please,
                     keep the pen. 

     Schuyler shrugs, sticks it in his breast pocket, starts out. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     When can I expect to hear-- 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     We'll be in touch. 

     Feingold gently shuts the door on schuyler's face.

     S C E N E   3 4   D E L E T E D 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     35(NEW).  I N T .   R A C Q U E T B A L L   C O U R T / C O R R I D O R  -  D A Y

     WHAM, a BALL SLAMS against a wall. 

     THROUGH A WINDOW, we see SCHUYLER playing violently, pumping 
     sweat... he's alone.  We hear the sound of a PHONE CALL OVER: 

                             SCHUYLER (V. O.) 
                     David, where the hell are you, we 
                     were supposed to meet at the club-- 

                             DAVID (V. O.) 
                     Oh, shit, sorry Sky, I spaced--
                     next Tuesday?

                             SCHUYLER (V. O.)
                     I'll be in Seattle. 

                             DAVID (V. O.) 
                     Buy you lunch soon as you get
                     back, I swear... 

     Fed up with playing alone, Schuyler lets the ball bounce, exits the
     court and heads for a LOCKER ROOM down the hall...

                             SCHUYLER (V. O.) 
                     I checked out CRS by the way-- 

                             DAVID (V. O.) 
                     Hey, great, you gonna go for it? 

                             SCHUYLER (V. O.)
                     Haven't decided yet...

     S C E N E   3 6   D E L E T E D 

     37(NEW).  E X T .   C O U N T R Y   C L U B   B A R  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER, in casual clothes, hair still wet from a shower, comes 
     out of a locker room area toward an outdoor BAR by a SWIMMING POOL
     at this upscale country ciub.  He passes PETE and JOHN, two middle- 
     aged RICH MEN sitting at a table near the bar; he overhears a
     snippet of their conversation-- 

                             JOHN 
                     --like fuckin' wildfire, just 
                     opened an office in Frisco here-- 

                             PETE 
                     I played my game in New York...
                     What do you think John, will CRS
                     ever go public? 

                             JOHN 
                           (laughs) 
                     Not likely, would you? 

     Schuyler slows down, eavesdropping, then moves toward the bar,
     addresses the BARTENDER with a nod toward John and Pete. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     New members? 

                             BARTENDER
                     I believe so. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This round's on me. 

     Schuyler moves casually toward the men--

                                                  DISSOLVE TO: 

     38(N). SAME LOCATION, LATER, the bartender brings another round of
     drinks to the table, Schuyler and the men have been chatting a 
     while, all seem relaxed.  Pete, the friendlier (drunker) of the
     two, puffs a CIGAR as he speaks: 

                             PETE 
                     ...last time I played Pebble, I swore
                     I'd never pick up a club again... 

     The others CHUCKLE knowingly.  Schuyler sips his drink, blinking
     and coughing discretely at the smoke; there's a slight pause. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Great thing about golf, the way it
                     takes you out of your life...
                     Speaking of games-- I take it you
                     two are familiar with CRS...? 

                             JOHN 
                     Uh-oh.  Time to piss... 

     He slides off his stool.  Pete studies Schuyler, sizing him up. 

                             PETE 
                     Why do you ask, Schuyler? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I couldn't help overhearing-- 

                             PETE 
                     We don't usually talk about it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I only bring it up because, well,
                     I recently tested for it. 

                             PETE 
                     Did you?  Kudos. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I just wasn't sure if they're for
                     real, whether it's worth it-- 

                             PETE 
                     Worth it... Gee, I dunno... they did
                     save my fucking life... 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Sorry? 

                             PETE 
                     Look, I don't know you, you don't know
                     me, but... I hit a certain point, 
                     nothing meant anything.  My work, the
                     wife and kids-- hell with 'em, I was 
                     sick of it all, y'know?  But CRS... they
                     changed everything.  "Are they for 
                     real?"  Who cares, maybe nothing is.
                        (raises his glass)
                     To reality. 

     Schuyler raises his glass, numbed by this outpouring.  Pete drains
     his drink, chuckling to himself.  His friend comes back, looking
     concerned, takes the man's arm. 

                             JOHN
                     C'mon Pete. 

                             PETE 
                       (winks at Schuyler) 
                     Good luck, pal.  You'll need it. 

     Schuyler stares after the two men dubiously as they move off.

                                                       CUT TO:

     39.  I N T .   L A W   F I R M   C O N F E R E N C E   R O O M  -  D A Y 

     A slick, designery conference room, filled with BABBLING LAWYERS-- 
     at the head of the table stands BOB PLYMPTON, a trustworthy man in
     his late 50's.  MURMURING CONTINUES during Plympton's address. 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Postponing
                     the Baer-Grace meeting is out of 
                     the question.  Schuyler gets on a
                     plane for Washington tomorrow
                     morning at seven with every 
                     contract, every side agreement, 
                     the complete closing package!

     Schuyler has been going through paperwork in the back of the room,
     he steps forward during the above. 

                             LAWYER 
                     But there's simply no-- 

     THWAP!  Schuyler DROPS the stack of papers on the table, SILENCE. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No is not an option.  If you fail
                     to recognize that, I'll find ten
                     other law firms in the yellow 
                     pages that can get the job done-- 

     CHIRP.  Schuyler's CELL-PHONE has started RINGING during the above.
     He finally removes it from his pocket and moves to a quiet corner. 

                             SCHUYLER
                           (impatient) 
                     Yes. 

     QUIET COMMOTION resumes IN BG during the following.  On the other
     end of the line, there's the bland, bureaucratic VOICE of CYNTHIA:

                             CYNTHIA (filter)
                     Mr. Van Orton? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yes, who is this? 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     This is Cynthia at CRS... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What?!  How did you get this number? 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     I'm just calling to inform you
                     that we've finished processing
                     your application-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm in a meeting-- 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     --and I'm afraid you didn't qualify. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     --so I don't have time for--
                       (beat, then quickly) 
                     Excuse me, what was that? 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     Well... your application was rejected. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     ...Why? 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     Oh, I'm afraid I don't have that 
                     information, but-- many applicants
                     don't meet the criteria.  We
                     apologize, we hope it hasn't 
                     caused you any inconvenience-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     This is absurd-- 

                             CYNTHIA (filter) 
                     Thank you for thinking of CRS. 

     CLICK and a DIAL TONE.  Schuyler shuts the phone and replaces it in
     his pocket, his mind suddenly far away from the meeting at hand.
     PLYMPTON, a wel1-meaning man with a fatherly attitude toward
     Schuyler, steps close to him and speaks quietly, concerned: 

                             PLYMPTON
                     Bad news, Sky? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, nothing.  Sorry, Bob.
                        (loudly, to boardroom) 
                     So were there any more questions, or
                     may I assume it's under control... 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     40.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER pulls up in his MBZ, the electric gate glides shut.  He
     gets out of the car and SETS THE ALARM.  He heads for the front
     steps of his home-- then freezes, blinks-- 

     ON HIS DOORSTEP lies a body, face-down, apparently a WINO, in a
     tattered, filthy overcoat. 

                                                  FLASH CUT TO:

     41.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (FLASHBACK) 

     SAME ANGLE, QUICK SHOT of the body of MR. VAN ORTON, sprawled 
     across the steps in much the same position as the wino, flat on his 
     stomach, head twisted at a grotesque angle.  His bathrobe is even
     similar in color to the wino's overcoac. 

                                                  CUT BACK TO:

     42.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER shakes off the memory, looking alarmed.  He calls out:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Hello!  What are you doing here? 

     THE BODY doesn't stir.  He approaches gingerly.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wonderful.  You OK?  You dead? 

     He crouches by the wino, winces at a strong smell, covers his nose.
     He reaches out to touch the body, but hesitates, pulls back.  Alive
     or dead, he doesn't want to have anything to do with this person. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Shit, shit, shit...

     The "wino" suddenly SPRINGS UP like a jack-in-the-box, bending
     backwards impossibly at the hips.  Schuyler lets out a CRY and 
     scrambles back toward his car.

     THE HEAD swivels to face him-- it's a grotesque HARLEQUIN, its head
     made of COLORED GLASS, LIT from within.  The MOUTH DROPS OPEN and a 
     tongue in the shape of a corkscrew SPRINGS OUT. 

     A SMALL KEY ON A HOOK dangles from the tip of the tongue.  One of
     the harlequin's glass eyes WINKS. 

     SCHUYLER stares in amazement for a few moments. 

     CLOSE on the dangling KEY as Schuyler fingers it.  The key catches
     the light and we see the letters "CRS" embossed on it. 

     42B(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  N I G H T 

     THE DUMMY is dumped in a straight-back chair in the foyer. 

     SCHUYLER takes a step back and studies it.  He crosses its legs,
     smirks and shakes his head, ascending the stairs. 

     CLOSE ON the disturbing empty stare of the DUMMY...

                                                       CUT TO: 

     43.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   B A T H R O O M / B E D R O O M  -  N I G H T 

     CLOSE ON SCHUYLER'S EYE as he blinks and removes a CONTACT LENS.  A
     NEWSCAST is barely audible in BG. 

     WIDER, Schuyler, squinting, in a bathrobe, enters from the bathroom
     off the bedroom, putting his contact lens case into a toiletries
     case.  He's been packing a leather GARMENT BAG, which hangs from a
     door, slips the toiletries into a "side pouch.  The TV PLAYS in BG,
     Bernard Shaw delivering the news. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (on TV) 
                     ...the bill goes before the House
                     next week, where it's expected to
                     meet stiff opposition-- 
                         (beat, touches his ear)
                     Wait, this just in... 

     This gets Schuyler's attention, he squints toward the television. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)
                     The U. S. geological service has 
                     detected a massive disturbance in the 
                     earth's crust deep beneath the northern
                     segment of the San Andreas fault... 

     SCHUYLER scrambles for his glasses, as Shaw struggles to continue. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) 
                     ...they have issued a warning that a
                     major earthquake of magnitude eight
                     or greater is likely to hit the San
                     Francisco Bay area within...
                             (a beat) 
                     Oh my God, the next fifteen minutes-- 

     SCHUYLER sits on the bed, breathes hard, stares at the tube. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)
                     There is no time for an evacuation.
                     The federal government has issued 
                     the following instructions for all
                     residents of central and northern
                     California... 

     SCHUYLER is freaking out, paces frantically, moves toward a phone--
     who's he going to call?  He makes a low MOAN. 

     SHAW'S voice CRACKS, he speaks very rapidly. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)
                     Locate emergency shut-offs for all
                     power and gas-- 

     SCHUYLER starts moving out of the room-- 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) 
                     Wait, there's no time for that-- just
                     stay away from windows and doors-- 

     SCHUYLER doubles back, avoiding a window, his panic mounting-- 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) 
                     Find a heavy piece of furniture such as
                     a desk or table and get under it-- 

     SCHUYLER looks around, sees no such appropriate spot in the room. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV)
                     If no such furniture is immediately
                     available, go to a window or doorway-- 

     SCHUYLER blinks, hesitates starts to move toward the doar-- 

                             BERNARD sHAW (cant., on TV) 
                     But first turn off all power and gas.
                     Crouch in a comfortable position, put 
                     your head between your knees and cover
                     it with your arms-- 

     SCHUYLER, confused, crouches as instructed--

                             BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) 
                     Then KISS YOUR LILY-WHITE ASS GOODBYE! 

     On this last line, Shaw's voice starts to ECHO and CHANGE.

     SCHUYLER rises, staring at the TV, mouth agape.

     SHAW WINKS.  His VOICE is utterly transformed.

                             BERNARD SHAW (on TV) 
                     Howdy Sky. 

     HIS FACE RIPPLES and MORPHS into a SKULL, it's becoming clear that
     this is a computer-generated Bernard shaw. 

                             CYBERSHAW (on TV)
                     Que pasa? 

     As CYBERSHAW speaks, his face will continue to transform, sometimes
     back to a recognizable human state, other times into abstract
     images, a talking piano, a dog, etc. 

                             CYBERSHAW (on TV)
                     Welcome to the Game! 
                     Congratulations on your decision
                     to let Consumer Recreation
                     Services entertain you. 

     The combination of relief, amazement and anger is a bit much for
     Schuyler to absorb.  Smiling sickly: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Fuckers! 

                             CYBERSHAW (on TV) 
                     This might be a good time to lay out
                     a few ground rules, help you enjoy 
                     your adventure.  You've received the
                     first key.  There will be others. 
                     Pay attention-- you never know where
                     you'll find 'em, you never know when
                     you'll need 'em, so keep 'em with
                     you at all times... 

     As he speaks, Schuyler reaches for the gold key on his bedside
     table.  He starts putting it onto his keychain. 

     ON TV SCREEN-- below CyberShaw, a PHONE NUMBER SCROLLS PAST. 

                             CYBERSHAW (on TV) 
                     You might want to write this number 
                     down, it's the CRS hotline, operators
                     are standing by to assist... but 
                     please don't call to ask what the 
                     object of the game is-- figuring that
                     out is the object of the game...

     SCHUYLER has snatched up the CRS pen to write down the number-- it
     doesn't work.  SWEARING, he tosses it aside, grabs another. 

     ON TV, CyberShaw MORPHS back into the original Bernard Shaw. 
     There's a quick VISUAL GLITCH on the tube as the original TV feed
     resumes-- Bernard Shaw is delivering a normal news story. 

                             BERNARD SHAW (on TV) 
                     --reaction on wall Street was muted 
                     following the Fed's announcement of... 

     SCHUYLER is taken with the display of electronic pyrotechnics, in
     spite of himself.  He hits the speaker button on his phone, dials. 

                             OPERATOR VOICE (filter)
                     You've reached CRS... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yeah, this is pretty impressive 
                     but listen-- 

                             OPERATOR VOICE (filter)

                              (BEEP) 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     My name is Schuyler Van Orton, my 
                     game just started.  Look, this is a
                     bad time, I'm about to leave town-- 

     A DIAL TONE, CRS doesn't take messages.  Schuyler sighs, HANGS UP. 

     44.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER crouches by a coaxial cable line emerging from the side of
     the house.  He fingers a box with a miniature LOOP and RABBIT EAR
     ANTENNA that's been spliced into the line with a tiny S-shaped 
     WIRE.  He starts to unscrew it, then thinks twice, heads back in. 

     WIDER, as Schuyler enters his mansion, a GIBBOUS MOON OVERHEAD.

                                                       CUT TO:

     45.  E X T .   S E A - T A C   A I R P O R T  -  D A Y

     Mist in the air, a jet taxis to a terminal. 

     46.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER comes out of the gate with the garment bag and a 
     briefcase.  He joins up with a DRIVER carrying a sign that says VAN
     ORTON, the man takes his bag for him. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm expecting a package with some
                     documents.  Did it arrive? 

     The man shakes his head, Schuyler, exasperated, whips out his cell-
     phone and dials.  As he and the driver move through the CROWD, they
     pass a red-eyed, dredlocked, homeless-looking RASTA MAN in a 
     BRIGHTLY COLORED outfit with knit cap, hassling other TRAVELERS.
     He turns his attention to Schuyler and begins walking alongside. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Ay mon, got sometin' fo you mon. 

                             DRIVER 
                         (to the rasta)
                     Get lost, pal. 

                             RASTA MAN
                     No can do. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     Bob, it's Sky, what the hell is 
                     going on?  No, the papers aren't 
                     here, you'll have to fax signature
                     copies straight to the BG offices
                     now.  Yeah I'll hold. 

     The driver and Schuyler climb into a little white people mover 
     cart, the driver starts forward, BEEPING at folks in the way.  The
     rasta man continues to badger Schuyler. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     You want what I got, mon. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (hand over the phone)
                     No thank you. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Dere are many paths to 
                     enlightenment, but you must choose
                     one and stay on it-- or you will
                     surely die in the darkness-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'll take my chances.

     The rasta man jogs alongside, holds up a stained, newsprint
     religious TRACT, Schuyler glances at it without taking it-- 

     CLOSE-- we see the words "CRISIS, REVELATION, SOLUTION."  The
     letters C, Rand S are printed in a different color from the rest. 

     WIDER-- Schuyler ignores the tract, he's talking to Bob again on
     the phone.  The driver SPEEDS UP as they pass a guard, entering a
     restricted access area. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     What?!  Fire their asses, that's it. 

     The Rasta Man runs out of breath as the cart SPEEDS UP.  He calls
     after Schuyler:

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Jah Love mon, dat's the key, dat's the key... 

     47.  E X T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  D A Y 

     Cold and bleak.  The little white truck emerges from the terminal,
     crosses the tarmac, heading toward an IDLING HELICOPTER, where is
     stops.  From the chopper, ALAN BAER emerges-- he's an elderly,
     muscular man, bluff, once blue-collar.  He gives Schuyler a firm
     handshake.  They have to SHOUT over the WHIRRING BLADES: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Alan!  What's wrong with a car-- 

                             BAER 
                     I'm giving you an overview of our 
                     little operation!  You gotta see the
                     new breed of high yield saplings... 

     SCHUYLER looks uncomfortable with this prospect.  The driver is
     already loading his bag into the chopper.  Baer claps a hand on 
     Schuyler's shoulder, leading him under the wash, into the chopper. 

     THE RASTA MAN is walking slowly across the tarmac nearby.  He
     watches the HELICOPTER ASCEND with a half-smile. 

     48.  I N T .   H E L I C O P T E R  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER and BAER in the back of the chopper. 

                             BAER
                     How was your flight? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fine. 

     Schuyler looks out the window. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV - On the PASTA MAN in his colorful clothes, now
     holding up a dangling KEY on a chain.  Moments later, he's
     invisible in the MIST. 

     ON SCHUYLER, looking disappointed, and annoyed with himself-- he
     realizes he's missed something.  He reaches into his pocket as Baer
     DRONES ON beside him.  Schuyler pulls out his KEYS, fingers the
     gold one with the CRS logo, thinking. 

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     49.  E X T .   M O U N T A I N S  -  D A Y 

     The HELICOPTER swoops low over a beautiful FORESTED MOUNTAINSIDE.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO: 

     50.  I N T .   B A E R - G R A C E   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 

     PAN from a WINDOW.  Outside, we see a sign-- BAER-GRACE LUMBER-- 
     and the helicopter, now idle on a pad.  MOVE PAST a HUMMING FAX
     MACHINE, find Schuyler addressing Alan Baer across a table.  A
     couple of other LUMBER EXECS are present.  Everyone wears a
     stricken expression, Schuyler's tone is matter-of-fact. 

                             BAER 
                     You've been planning this for months,
                     haven't you?  Sandbagging me like 
                     this, selling us for scrap... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     BG lumber is not profitable and 
                     hasn't been for years, my duty is to
                     salvage what I can.  These are the
                     closing papers, in ten minutes I'm
                     going to present the sale terms to
                     the shareholders and elect my new 
                     management team. 

     As he speaks, Schuyler moves to the fax machine.  A TRANSMISSION
     has come through, he picks up the sheaf of papers. 

                             BAER 
                     I was friends with your father, you
                     bastard, I watched you grow up, and
                     now you kick me in the balls-- 

     Schuyler squints at the papers in his hand, flipping through them. 

     CLOSE, the entire transmission has been GARBLED.  The words all
     BLEED TOGETHER incomprehensibly, it looks like a child's scribbles. 

                             BAER (O.S.) 
                     That's not how you play the game. 

     SCHUYLER turns on him, a suspicion forming...

                             BAER 
                     You could've fucking told me! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What game? 

     Schuyler studies the SENSELESS PAGES for a moment then puts them
     down, shaking off his apprehensions. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Never mind... we'll just have to
                     go with the earlier draft. 

     In BG, one exec picks up a page, WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT, who
     moves out of the room.  Schuyler moves to his briefcase.  It's
     LOCKED.  He starts patting his pockets. 

                             BAER
                     Can't find your keys? 

     Baer has a malevolent expression.  Schuyler looks at him. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Where are they. 

                             BAER
                     Up your ass?

     A couple of execs stifle chuckles.  Schuyler's suspicions mount. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Up my ass, very funny... 

     His eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in
     front of him.  He picks it up:

     INSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note:
     "CRS CALLED."  We don't see what's written below. 

     SCHUYLER is reeling, paranoia confirmed. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't-- OK.  OK, you're with CRS... 

     Baer stares at him blankly.  Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes,
     seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     So the game, it's just a screen, to
                     blow this deal...

                             BAER 
                     I'm not following you. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Like hell you aren't.  How did you
                     get my brother involved, that's
                     unforgivable.

     The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion.  As
     he speaks, the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK.  Schuyler
     stares at him menacingly.  Hesitantly: 

                             ASSISTANT 
                     Um... sorry to interrupt.  We've
                     been having some trouble with this 
                     fax, so they re-sent the material.
                     It's all OK now. 

     The assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents
     in front of Schuyler.  The assistant fishes in his pocket. 

                             ASSISTANT 
                     Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these 
                     yours?  The pilot found 'em on the
                     floor of the chopper... 

     Schuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out,
     looks from them to the paperwork.  Then he glances back at the
     handwritten note on the table: 

     INSERT NOTE:  It actually reads "CBS CALLED."  (Schuyler's thumb or
     a Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look 
     like an R.)  It continues "Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun..." 

     SCHUYLER takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his
     watch.  He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Everything seems to be in order. 
                     Please disregard my last comments.
                     The shareholders meeting is about
                     to get underway... Shall we? 

     He heads for the door.  As he leaves, the execs exchange looks. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     51.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler wanders through the terminal, carrying his bags, glancing 
     periodically at the DEPARTURES monitor and the clock.  His manner
     now has changed, he eyes every PASSERBY, especially the ODD ONES. 

                             P. A. VOICE (filter) 
                     Flight 177 to San Francisco is now
                     boarding at Gate 14... 

     Suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk, 
     Schuyler TRIPS and goes sprawling.  The Rasta Man steps out, now
     wearing SUNGLASSES with PINK LENSES. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention. 

     Schuyler gets up, dusts himself off.  As calmly as possible:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Listen, I quit.

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Free at last... you won't be
                     needin' this, then. 

     He snatches up the briefcase, dances back a few paces.  Schuyler
     speaks as if to a child. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, cretin.  I'm quitting the game. 

     The rasta man keeps backing away, puts a hand to his ear. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Wha's that, mon?  I didna hear you. 

     Schuyler is pursuing the man, walking faster and faster.

                             SCHUYLER
                     I said I-- shit! 

     The rasta turns and RUNS, Schuyler bolts after him, unable to 
     believe this is happening.  They draw a lot of looks during the 
     brief chase through the terminal, the suited businessman, garment
     bag flapping behind him, in pursuit of the crazy rasta. 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Help, help!  The mon is crazy! 

     He runs into a MEN'S ROOM, Schuyler follows a moment later. 

     52.  I N T .   A I R P O R T   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler has the rasta cornered now-- but he doesn't have the
     briefcase.  Both are out of breath.  PISSING MEN look wary. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Where is it? 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Got something better. 

     The rasta men holds out a SHINY KEY on a chain.  Schuyler narrows
     his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I realize you're just some bit 
                     player, but I'd like you to get a
                     message to your employers.  This
                     bullshit is interfering with my 
                     work, it's breaking my concentration
                     and I can't allow that to happen-- 

     THE RASTA makes a sad face, SNIFFLES, still dangling the key. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     If I take that stupid key, will you 
                     give me back my briefcase and go away? 

     The rasta nods with a big grin.  Schuyler steps forward, hand
     extended.  The rasta flings open the door of a STALL beside him and
     hurls the key into the TOILET.  Instinctively, Schuyler moves to
     grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and
     sleeve DRIPPING.  The key is missing from the end of the chain. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What the fuck am I doing?! 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     Don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit. 

     He drops the rasta schtick, speaks with an Ivy League accent: 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     So try looking at it through rose-
                     colored glasses... here. 

     He takes off his sunglasses, folds them and tucks them in the
     pocket of Schuyler's suit.  Then he reaches above him and pulls 
     down the briefcase, which was perched on top of the stall.
     Schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I told you, this is over!  I quit! 

                             RASTA MAN 
                     They all say that at first. 

     He gives Schuyler a hearty SLAP on the back and strolls off,
     HUMMING.  Schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head.  He
     puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket. 

     CLOSE ON SUNGLASSES-- there's the image of a tiny GOLD KEY embossed
     on each of the arms. 

     SCHUYLER puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a GLIMPSE
     of himself in the mirror-- he looks silly.  He quickly takes them
     off.  As Schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind... the
     Rasta has slapped a colorful SIGN that reads "KICK ME" on his back. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     53.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y

     THE NEON SIGN FIZZLES in front of this low-rent establishment.

     54.  I N T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 

     BELLS RING and LIGHTS FLASH as a DRUNK plays a PINBALL MACHINE with 
     a lot of body English.  SCHUYLER, stuck at a table right next to 
     the machine, winces at the noise, checks his watch and rises.  He
     makes his way through the lunch hour CROWD to the bar, leans toward
     the bartender, a gravelly-voiced woman-- RONNIE. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I was supposed to meet someone 
                     here, a David Van Orton-- I was 
                     wondering if he'd left a message. 

                             RONNIE 
                     'Fraid not, sorry. 

     He drums his fingers, then whips out a CELLPHONE, spins around
     quickly as he starts to dial-- 

     --and SMACKS into Christine the waitress as she emerges from the
     kitchen carrying a tray-- 

     --SCHUYLER gets hit in the chest with a TRAY OF DESSERTS, colorful
     JELLO, CREAM PIE, etc.  He stands there, stunned and DRIPPING. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Fuck me! 

     She starts picking up plates and silverware, oblivious to 
     Schuyler's own plight; Ronnie charges out from behind the bar. 
     After the first shock, Schuyler CHUCKLES with annoyance.  He wipes
     the phone clean, pocketing it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh this is cute.  Very cute. 

                             RONNIE 
                     What happened here, you OK? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     It was an accident-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     No it wasn't. 

     Ronnie gives Christine a look as she starts wiping at Schuyler with
     a rag.  He picks at his chest, examines the WHIPPED CREAM, tastes 
     it.  Schuyler addresses the kneeling Christine: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What's next, a giant banana peel? 

     CHRISTINE squints up at him, puzzled. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Huh?  Oh I get it-- you're nuts. 

                             RONNIE
                     Chrissy, just apologize... 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Dickhead here was on the phone, he
                     walked right into me! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Drop the act, you've been waiting
                     all day for this moment. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Shut the fuck up. 

                             RONNIE
                     Go home, you're fired. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     What?... 

                             RONNIE
                     You heard me. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Fuck you too. 

     She THROWS a plate on the ground, it shatters, then storms off into
     the kitchen.  Schuyler CHUCKLES angrily, pushing through the slop
     on the floor with his shoe, looking for something. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Let's get this over with... Where's
                     the next key?  Does she have it? 

     Ronnie stares, uncomprehending... Schuyler goes after Christine.

     55.  I N T .   L E O ' S   K I T C H E N  -  D A Y 

     He crosses past a short-order COOK in the grimy industrial kitchen,
     pulling a cube of JELLO out of his lapel pocket.  He finds
     Christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers, as she finishes
     changing into her street clothes.  Her brown uniform hangs from a
     locker door, the nameplate "CHRIS" prominent. 

     CLOSE as his fingers touch the CRS of CHRIS-- they even look a bit
     brighter than the H and the I. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I wish you people could be a
                     little more subtle. 

     CHRISTINE notices him for the first time. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Asshole, just send me the goddamn
                     dry-cleaning bill.  Could you--? 

     She waves a hand at him, "go away" and ducks out of view, finishing
     dressing into punk-grungy street clothes.  She SLAMS the locker,
     starts to push past him, pulling on her backpack bag. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Don't you have something for me? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Uh-huh sure, here you go. 

     She puts her hand into her side pocket, pulls it out with her
     middle finger extended, moving away from him in a hurry.
     Schuyler's face falls-- he made another mistake. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wait, you really work here-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Not anymore, thanks to you. 

     She's out the SWINGING kitchen door.  Schuyler absorbs his blunder
     for a moment, then hurries after her. 

     56.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 

     Schuyler catches up as Christine hurries toward a MUNI station,
     LIGHTING a cigarette.  A few PEDESTRIANS come off the steps from
     the arriving elevated train in this residential SF neighborhood. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Slow down-- you don't understand, I
                     thought it was a gag. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No, you don't understand.  I carry
                     mace and I know how to use it. 

     She reaches into her purse/backpack, Schuyler backs off. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I was only trying to apologize. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Shit, it's in here somewhere-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fine. 

     He starts to move away, then they both hear GASPING O. S.-- 

     ON THE STEPS, a HEAVY MAN, 60, in a coat and tie has collapsed, 
     struggling for breath, very pale.  Christine and Schuyler are the
     only pedestrians around now. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Shit-- 

     She rushes to help the guy, loosening his tie-- he JOLTS. 

     SCHUYLER looks up at them dubiously, brushing a scrap of food still
     clinging to his suit. 

     CHRISTINE reaches in to clear the guy's throat, starting CPR.  She
     shoots a look at Schuyler. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You got a fucking phone, call an
                     ambulance! 

     Schuyler approaches slowly, pulling out his phone, studying the guy as
     Christine gives him mouth-to-mouth. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This is just too weird-- it can't
                     be real-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You really are insane! 

     SCHUYLER leans close to look at the man. 

     ON THE MAN'S FACE-- sweating, contorted, unnaturally pale, his eyes
     rolling back as he GAGS his last...

     CHRISTINE grabs the phone away from Schuyler, dials. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     We need an ambulance, guy's having a 
                     heart attack near the MUNI station at
                     5th and Market-- 
                          (to Schuyler) 
                     What's the number on this thing?! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't give it out-- 
                       (off her horrified look)
                     731-5723-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     731-5723-- yeah, thanks--

     She stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the man's chest, returns
     to the mouth-to-mouth.  Schuyler looks around uncomfortably, 
     starting to believe this is a real heart attack. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Is there anything I can do? 

     CHRISTINE ignores him, all attention on saving this guy's life...

     56A. WIDE as an AMBULANCE pulls up, SIREN BLARING.  A couple of
     MALE PARAMEDICS hurry out with a stretcher. 

     ON THE STEPS, the two PARAMEDICS lift the unconscious HEAVY MAN
     onto the stretcher while Christine and Schuyler stand aside.  Both
     have small EARPIECES that look like hearing aids, with wires into
     their clothes.  Throughout the following, there's a lot of MEDICAL
     BUSINESS-- feeding the victim OXYGEN, giving him INJECTIONS, etc. 

                             PARAMEDIC #1
                          (to Schuyler) 
                     Could you come with us, help us
                     fill out a few forms-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No!  I have work to do-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     I'll go. 

     She climbs into the back, they start to shut the doors. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wait a minute, you've got my phone-- 

     He climbs in to get it back, they SLAM THE DOORS and start moving. 

     THE AMBULANCE peels out.  We now see the LOGO on the back:
     "CITYWIDE RESCUE SYSTEMS," with the C, R and S in RED. 

     57.  I N T .   A M B U L A N C E  -  D A Y 

     The PARAMEDICS are intent on the gasping man.  The SIREN BLARES, a
     bit MUFFLED in here.  Schuyler, looking out the back, is extremely
     pissed, makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Chill, will you?! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I don't want to be here. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Neither do I, now siddown, get
                     outta their way! 

     A BUMP almost sends him flying atop the stretcher.  Schuyler sits
     near Christine on a ledge near the back doors.  Petulant: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'd like my phone back please. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     58(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I T A L   E N T R A N C E / G A R A G E  -  D A Y 

     An UNDERGROUND RAMP, signs reading "EMERGENCY VEHICLES ONLY," a set
     of DOORS leading into the lobby of an EMERGENCY ROOM; MEDICAL
     PERSONNEL visible inside, INJURED PEOPLE, etc., a few PEOPLE mill
     outside the doors. 

     THE AMBULANCE SCREECHES to a stop, the back doors fly open, the
     PARAMEDICS wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance,
     automatic doors OPEN and CLOSE for them.  Schuyler and Christine
     climb out, disoriented, walking more slowly to the doors.  The
     AMBULANCE pulls away behind them.  Schuyler nearly slips in a
     mysterious dark PUDDLE. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh, this day keeps getting better. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What is your problem, you think 
                     the whole fucking world revolves
                     around you? 

     As she says this, she walks right into the ELECTRIC DOORS, which
     fail to open for them. 

     THEIR POV-- THROUGH THE DOORS the gathered STAFF and PATIENTS all
     turn at once to regard Christine and Schuyler.  They GRIN and WINK. 

     ON SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE, who barely get the chance to register
     this before-- 

     THE LIGHTS GO OUT... PITCH BLACKNESS and SUDDEN SILENCE.  We hear 
     only SCHUYLER'S BITTER LAUGHTER.  Dialogue OVER DARKNESS: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     As a matter of fact... 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What the fuck is going on?! 

     We hear RUSTLING in a purse, but still see next to nothing. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It's a little hard to explain...

                             CHRISTINE
                     Try! 

     We hear the STRIKING OF A MATCH, there's some ORANGE LIGHT--
     CHRISTINE holds the match.  The whole area is DESERTED, except for 
     the two of them.  SCHUYLER kicks at the glass doors-- they're not
     going to give, nothing is visible beyond them. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I seem to be playing a game.  This
                     is supposed to be funny-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     I don't get it.

                             SCHUYLER
                     --a challenge, a puzzle. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     OK, I'm puzzled.  Where are we? 

     SCHUYLER has found a STEEL DOOR with a GLOWING RED SIGN:  EMERGENCY
     USE ONLY.  He yanks it open and a PAIL swings down, dumping WATER
     on his head.  He's facing a BRICK WALL through the door. 

     CHRISTINE can't help but LAUGH, then YELPS in pain as the match
     burns her fingers.  LIGHTS another.  Schuyler flips open his phone.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Damn it, no signal. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Here's a lightswitch-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I wouldn't-- 

     She flips it on, A BLINDING STROBE FLASHES for a few seconds-- both 
     CRY OUT-- then the BULB EXPLODES in a shower of sparks. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't know the rules, if there are
                     any, but it seems the obvious move
                     usually backfires...

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Of course.  I have no idea what 
                     you're talking about.

     They've taken a few steps forward, exploring the DARK.  She LIGHTS
     a cigarette with the next match, nearly running into ANOTHER DOOR.
     She RATTLES it-- locked. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Son of a bitch. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I think I have a key. 

     Schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold CRS key-- nope. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Damn it... 
                       (a beat, thoughtful)
                     Wrong key... 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Last match. 

     In the matchlight, we see Schuyler fumbling in his pockets, pulling
     out the ROSY SUNGLASSES from the Rasta.  He puts them on. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Too bright for you, is it? 

     SCHUYLER'S POV as the last MATCH GOES OUT-- CHRISTINE GLOWS RED in
     the matchlight for a moment, then as soon as it goes out, we see a
     GLOW of FLUORESCENT PAINT on the ground... a series of STRIPES and
     ARROWS in DIFFERENT COLORS, GLOWING.  These start PARALLEL near
     where he stands, then RADIATE in different directions.  CHRISTINE
     is but a SILHOUETTE against the COLORED LINES.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I can see now.  Grab my arm. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No way!  You're crazy! 

     CHRISTINE moves away from him. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Stay on the path! 

     A BURST OF FLAME erupts from the GROUND close enough to scare the
     shit out of CHRISTINE, who SCREAMS.  SCHUYLER hurries toward her. 

     The FLAMES VANISH, she lurches in a differrent direction-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Christine, don't move! 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Leave me alone!

     She LOSES HER FOOTING on a slippery surface, falls, sliding down a
     gentle SLOPE. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Help! 

     SCHUYLER follows.  FALLING himself.  They try to reach toward each 
     other for purchase, but it's no good, the slope is getting steeper.

     58A. In a moment SCHUYLER tumbles on top of Christine in a four-
     foot deep round CHILDREN'S POOL, but it isn't full of water.
     There's a bit of BLACK LIGHT here, enough to make out-- 

     --COCKROACHES, thousands of them, a TEEMING ROIL OF INSECTS in a
     CHURNING LIQUID.  There's a BUZZING NOISE, both SCREAM. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Aaggh!  BUGS!! 

     SCHUYLER quickly helps lift Christine out.  She starts to pull him
     upward, but-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Where are the glasses?! 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Fuck the glasses! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     We can't get out of here without them! 

     He steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick,
     finally coming up with the glasses.  He shakes them free of INSECTS
     and clambers out to join Christine, who's GASPING and brushing the
     bugs off of her.  SCHUYLER puts on the glasses and holds up a BUG. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     They're rubber.  Hold onto me,
                     I'll get us out of here.

                             CHRISTINE
                     Ha! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fine, stay. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     No! 

     She grabs his arm; both are now covered in MUCK from the bug soup. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What's your favorite color?

                             CHRISTINE
                     ...Blue? 

     He takes off the glasses, puts them on her.  She looks around.

     HER POV-- the RAINBOW of COLORED LINES on the FLOOR...

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Wow... OK, this is kinda cool.  Hey! 

     SCHUYLER slips the glasses off her, puts them back on.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Sorry, it's my game.  But we'll
                     take blue. 

     HIS POV-- a BLUE LINE moves in a snaking path ahead of them, going
     in circles now and then, INTERSECTING or moving PARALLEL to other
     colors, up a series of ramps.  This space sometimes resembles a
     PARKING GARAGE, scmetimes a SEWER or a STEAM TUNNEL. 

     CHRISTINE keeps a hand on Schuyler as he follows the path. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Talk about the blind leading the
                     blind... what's your name anyway? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Sky Van Orton. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Sky?  Were your folks hippies or
                     something? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Far from it. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I'm Christine Kaminsky. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Nice to meet you. 

     58B. LATER, CHRISTINE almost hugs Schuyler now, as they move in a
     seemingly random pattern in the darkness. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It's a company called Consumer 
                     Recreation Services, CRS.  I never
                     know what's gonna happen next. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Well, who does. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Until recently, I had a pretty
                     good idea... Duck. 

     The BLUE LINE has led them into a NARROW TUNNEL, soon they're
     crawling on hands and knees. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     So are you like a serious masochist,
                     or just really, really bored? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been
                     dragged into this. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Well... I have to tell you 
                     something.  Some guy came into 
                     Leo's yesterday, showed me your 
                     picture, offered me 250 bucks to
                     spill that food on you. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Ah. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Said it was a practical joke.  I
                     figured what the hell, I can use
                     the money-- I got him up to 500. 
                     I hated that fucking job anyway-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wait, so the heart attack, you
                     knew that was a joke too-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No!  It scared the shit out of me-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     But that CPR routine-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I used to be a lifeguard. 

                             SCHUYLER
                             (points) 
                     We're getting somewhere... 

     The TUNNEL has opened up again.  There's even a tiny bit of VISIBLE
     LIGHT now.  He takes off the glasses, gives them to her. 

     HER POV-- the COLORED LINES are all joining up from different
     directions.  A few steps onward they all converge at a point, like
     the spokes of a wheel, at a WHITE SPOT on the ground...

     SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE look around, then Schuyler points upward-- 

     A WHITE RING overhead... it looks like the underside of a MANHOLE
     COVER, with an illuminated CIRCLE OF LIGHT around the rim, a halo. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     How do we get up there? 

     SCHUYLER steps on the circle of WHITE-- it's a BUTTON.  A ROPE
     LADDER drops down. 

     59.  E X T .   W A L K W A Y  -  E V E N I N G 

     A MANHOLE COVER slides aside, SCHUYLER climbs out and helps
     Christine up.  It's a short, covered WOODEN WALKWAY in an alley. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Well, that was pointless... but
                     different... kind of fun... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mm, a different kind of fun.
                     What's your middle name? 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Louise... why? 

     SCHUYLER points to some GRAFFITI-- a HEART with "SVO + CLK." 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're supposed to be here... they
                     picked you for a reason. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     But-- why? 

     They start to move shakily down the CONSTRUCTION WALKWAY, both
     bedraggled, covered in goo.  HANDBILLS cover one wall. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Probably knew you'd play Good 
                     Samaritan for that guy, drag me 
                     along-- but they could have hired an 
                     actor for that, less of a risk...

     ON THE WALL, a series of HANDBILLS say, "AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
     SOMETHING?"  SCHUYLER puzzles over these as they move, gets to one
     last one-- "BEHIND YOU, STUPID." 

     SCHUYLER looks back toward the end of the alley-- 

     A YELLOW DUMPSTER with the logo, "CONSOLIDATED REFUSE SUPPLY" and
     the smaller image of a KEY.  SCHUYLER moves quickly to it, throws
     open the lid. 

     ANGLE IN DUMPSTER-- a MOUNTAIN of SHREDDED PAPER. 

     SCHUYLER rolls his eyes, sorting through it.  Christine approaches.

                             CHRISTINE 
                     This is really sick.  I think
                     they're trying to fix us up. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Maybe you can't play alone-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Who says I want to play?
                             (a sigh) 
                     OK, what the fuck are you doing in
                     the dumpster. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     There's something in here I need. 

     He climbs inside, dives in... and pops up again in a moment with-- 

     CLOSE-- A Z-SHAPED WINDOW CRANK.  Sure enough, there's a KEY
     embossed on the side. 

     SCHUYLER climbs out again, brandishing the small crank. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     What's that for? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I imagine I'll find out. 

     60.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  E V E N I N G 

     SCHUYLER pockets the crank as he and CHRISTINE emerge from the
     alley.  PEDESTRIANS give them a wide berth.  To a PASSERBY: 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What are you looking at? 

     Schuyler heads straight for the CRS doors, the large numbers 636
     printed above-- it's LOCKED.  He tries his little GOLD KEY on a
     deadbolt, it's USELESS of course. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This is their offices.  We must
                     have been in their garage... my 
                     office is just a few blocks from 
                     here, we can get cleaned up there. 

     He walks a few steps on, she stands still for a moment, then nods
     agreeably and follows. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     61.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T 

     START ON THE SKYLINE-- SCHUYLER moves from the window, as we hear a 
     DOOR OPEN.  CHRISTINE emerges from the attached dressing area and
     bath, toweling damp hair, in an oversized Harvard sweatshirt and
     gym shorts, with a large plastic bag containing her filthy clothes.
     She looks good, clearly she put some effort into her make-up. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Your turn. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (moving past her) 
                     Find everything you need? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You're outta conditioner. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     My apologies, I'll have it taken care
                     of.  Help yourself to the fridge. 

     He points to a MINI-FRIDGE, shuts the door, a moment later we hear
     WATER RUNNING.  She looks around the office, letting down her
     facade.  She seems quite impressed, and intimidated, by the place.
     She looks back toward the bathroom door-- maybe this guy isn't so
     bad after all.  From this point, she takes a more seductive tack. 

     62.  I N T .   D R E S S I N G   A R E A / B A T H  -  N I G H T 

     LATER, Schuyler has cleaned up, is finishing dressing, pulling a
     pair of jeans over boxer shorts, tucking in a sport shirt.
     Christine talks through the closed door. 

                             CHRISTINE (O. S.)
                     So um... how rich are you anyway? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                             (amused) 
                     Rich enough.  Bit forward, aren't you? 

                             CHRISTINE (O. S.) 
                     Well, what exactly do you do? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Manage investments, some venture 
                     capital, I'm on the board of a number
                     of publicly traded companies... 

                             CHRISTINE (O. S.) 
                     So you just like, move money around? 

     63.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T

     Schuyler emerges, shoes in hand.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Basically.  Beats working, huh? 

     Christine sits on his desk, with her bag slung over her shoulder,
     eating an APPLE.  She slides off the desk, flirting rather bluntly. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You don't look so bad, without the tie. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, I hope you haven't been too
                     put out... I could probably get
                     you another job, I have a stake in 
                     a couple of restaurants--

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I'm not much of a waitress, really.
                     Y'know, today's been kind of-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Can you type? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Kind of a turn-on, you know?
                       (getting no response) 
                     I didn't mean-- just, the danger...
                     Like fucking in a graveyard. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mm.  So where do you live? 

     Christine realizes her come-on is falling flat, she pulls back,
     tossing her unfinished apple in the trash. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Out in Concord, with my folks,
                     unfortunately.  They're never
                     gonna believe that I've been 
                     hanging out with a guy like you. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What do you mean? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Nothing, just-- most of the guys I
                     see have tats, y'know? 
                       (off his confused look)
                     Tattoos... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Of course.  We'd better head 
                     downstairs, the limo's waiting. 

     Christine nods disappointedly as Schuyler moves to the door. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     64.  I N T .   L I M O  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler and Christine ride in silence in the back seat. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Mind if I smoke in here? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Yes. 
                        (leaning forward)
                     Up here on the left. 

     As the limo pulls over, he and Christine turn to each other.  It's
     a somewhat awkward moment. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     So what's our next move?  I mean, in 
                     the game.  Obviously we need to figure
                     out what that crank thing is for-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm not playing anymore. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                          (disappointed)
                     Why not? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I have a life.  Jack'll take you
                     home, or wherever you want to go. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Yeah, maybe I'll get in a little
                     ballroom dancing before bed-- 

     The limo has stopped now.  Schuyler has started to open the door. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Wait, what about your clothes? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Forget it. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     C'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt. 

     So saying, she pulls it off.  She's wearing a black bra... a ROSE
     is tattooed on her shoulder.  Schuyler can't help but react.  She
     thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, it's not-- just-- back from
                     the cleaners. 

                             CHRISTINE
                            (throatily) 
                     You dry clean your sweatshirts... 

     He nods slightly... as he reaches to take it-- 

     --CHRISTINE leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him
     a LONG, HARD KISS. 

     JACK THE DRIVER, middle-aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a
     glimpse of this, quickly turns away. 

     CHRISTINE breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat,
     waiting for Schuyler to make the next move. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     See ya. 

     Schuyler nods again, torn.  She's looking at him expectantly.  He's
     clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female.  Sadly,
     he waves a hand. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Good night. 

     65.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler shuts the door, sweatshirt in hand, the dome light slowly
     DIMS OUT out on the crestfallen Christine-- we see her mouth a 
     CURSE.  Schuyler moves toward his MBZ, the limo IDLING.  He's about
     to get inside when he sees a TICKET IN AN ENVELOPE under the
     windshield wiper.  He SNORTS-- insult to injury-- tosses it on the
     dash as he climbs in. 

     66.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

     He sits behind the wheel, watching the lights of the limo 
     disappear.  He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment, then STARTS at the
     sound of a MOTOR STARTING across the street. 

     ANGLE THROUGH SIDE WINDOW-- an MBZ the same year, model and color
     as Schuyler's-- pulls away from the curb, Schuyler gets a glimpse
     of something REFLECTING STREET LIGHT in the window of the car-- a 
     gun?  A camera with a long lens?  The car makes a quick U-turn and
     drives in the same direction as the limo. 

     SCHUYLER, curious, STARTS THE ENGINE as if to pursue.  Then he
     glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye.  He
     doesn't put the car in gear, picks up the envelope instead... 

     CLOSE ON ENVELOPE-- The words "OPEN ME" are printed in BLOCK 
     LETTERS on the outside.  He opens it quickly-- there's no ticket
     inside, but he shakes out a RAINBOW-COLORED CONDOM in a clear 
     wrapper and a NOTE in KIDNAPPER LETTERS:  "BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY." 

     SCHUYLER frowns at this and throws the note aside.  He flips on the
     WINDSHIELD WIPERS (it's started to DRIZZLE) and pulls out. 

     POV THROUGH WINDESIELD-- A DARK FIGURE runs from the curb by Leo's,
     right in front of the car, SCHUYLER SLAMS on the BRAKES-- 

     --It's DAVID.  He hurries around to the passenger door and jumps
     in, looking haggard, scared, a man on the run. 

                             DAVID
                     Drive.  Anywhere. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Jesus, David, you scared the shit
                     out of me-- 

                             DAVID 
                     I'm sorry Sky, just drive, please-- 

     SCHUYLER pulls forward. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Where were you today? 

                             DAVID 
                     I almost didn't make it at all.  I
                     been in the bar for hours, waiting
                     for you to come back to your car-- 
                     Jesus, I can't believe I did this to
                     you, I'm so sorry-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Slow down, take a breath-- what
                     are you talking about? 

                             DAVID 
                     The game!  It just doesn't stop! 
                     I thought I'd finished playing a
                     long time ago, I paid the bill,
                     then it started all over again,
                     they won't leave me alone-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                         (slowly, evenly) 
                     Calm down.  What are they doing to you? 

                             DAVID 
                     Everything.  It just doesn't stop. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look.  That's crazy.  Yes, it's a 
                     pain in the ass, but why would they
                     keep playing once you paid them? 

                             DAVID 
                     I don't know!  I paid them MORE to
                     make it stop, God help me I even 
                     gave you to them... but they won't
                     leave me alone! 

     He sees the crumpled note on the floor, picks it up-- 

                             DAVID
                     What's this? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It was on my windshield-- 

                             DAVID
                     Oh shit, oh SHIT they must be
                     following us-- 

     He cranks his neck around, looking for pursuers.  Schuyler looks at
     him for a beat-- BANG!  He almost loses control of the wheel.

     A TIRE HAS BLOWN.  Schuyler drives ON THE RIM, struggles to get 
     over to the curb, BRAKES hard and stops. 

     73.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

     David's losing it, looking around.

                             DAVID 
                     They're shooting at us!

                             SCHUYLER 
                     David, get a grip, it's just a
                     flat tire! 

     He picks up the phone, punches buttons, gets nothing. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Damn it, the phone's not working-- 

                             DAVID
                     Of course not. 

                             SCHUYLER
                          (climbing out) 
                     Fine, I'll change the fucking
                     thing myself. 

                             DAVID 
                     Just hurry-- I'll pop the trunk. 

     David reaches for the glovebox. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, you can't do it from-- 

     CLOSE ON GLOVEBOX-- it POPS OPEN and KEYS SPILL OUT.  There are at
     least fifty of them jammed in there, all kinds, silver and gold...
     and all have CRS stamped on them. 

     SCHUYLER leans closer, intrigued.  David's eyes go wide as he
     fingers a few of these keys. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What the fuck are those-- 

                             DAVID 
                        (whirling on him) 
                     Like you don't know.  Sonofabitch, 
                     they got to you first, didn't they? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Um, David-- hello? 

     74(NEW).  E X T .   G O L D E N   G A T E   P A R K  -  N I G H T 

     David gets out of the car in a hurry, amidst the greenery in the
     park.  RAINING HARDER now. 

                             DAVID 
                     It's more than that isn't it?  You're
                     part of it, you're one of them!  Of 
                     course, it makes perfect sense! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     They planted those keys!  I don't
                     know what the hell they're for-- 

     Schuyler tries hard to be rational, but David is over the edge.

                             DAVID
                     You're behind the whole thing aren't 
                     you?  You and your sick fucking
                     friends set it up-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What?!  What friends?  Get a grip,
                     David-- why would I do that? 

                             DAVID 
                     I don't know, out of boredom, to
                     get back at me--

                             SCHUYLER
                     For what?! 

                             DAVID 
                     For being a weirdo, for trying to
                     be happy?  Well, congratulations,
                     you win.  Now make it stop! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (grabbing him) 
                     I can't!  Listen to me-- 

                             DAVID
                     Fuck you! 

     David SLUGS HIM in the face, Schuyler staggers back, clutches his 
     BLEEDING nose.  David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the
     Japanese Tea Garden. 

     SCHUYLER pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of
     breath, calling after David, who's vanished.  He leans against a 
     tree, PANTING, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a SCRAP OF TISSUE
     from his pocket.  He hears a PHONE RINGING, moves toward it,
     emerging through bushes near the ACADEMY OF SCIENCE... 

     He pauses at the RINGING PAYPHONE.  He decides not to pick it up, 
     looking around at the deserted MUSEUM BUILDINGS and hurrying toward
     civilization.  He passes other PAYPHONES en route to the park 
     exit... each one STARTS RINGING as he approaches it.  He moves
     faster, freaked.  At the edge of the park, he snatches one up-- 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     What have you done to my brother,
                     you bastards?!  This is over, I'm
                     not playing anymore--
                              (beat) 
                     Hello, is anyone there-- 

                             PHONE VOICE 
                     If you'd like to make a call, 
                     please hang up and dial again-- if
                     you need help-- 

     SCHUYLER slams the phone down.  He dabs his nose one more time,
     tosses the paper scrap into the trash. 

     CLOSE ON SCRAP-- "CRS" with the emergency NUMBER, the blue ink has
     BLED with the rain and Schuyler's BLOOD...

     SCENE 75 DELETED 

     76(NEW).  E X T .   F U L T O N   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 

     POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD, as Schuyler emerges from the park.  The
     car suddenly MOVES FORWARD-- 

     WITH SCHUYLER.  He walks to the curb, distractedly raises a hand
     for a cab, which pulls up instantly.  He climbs in.

     77.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     An aged, battered CAB; PLEXIGLAS between the CABBIE and the back.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Six three six Mission, please.

     The cabbie nods and hits the gas. 

     78.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T

     The cab roars down the street, KICKING UP WATER from the gutters. 

     79.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler bites his cuticle, not watching where they're going; the 
     windows are wet and fogged.  Then he looks out, narrows his eyes
     and RAPS on the PLEXIGLAS PARTITION. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're heading the wrong way. 

                             CABBIE (filter) 
                     Relax, pal, you'll get where
                     you're going. 

     The cabbie turns IN PROFILE for a moment.  He appears to be wearing
     a HEARING AID, a round piece of plastic, a tiny WIRE disappearing
     into his shirt.  And there's something familiar about his face.
     Schuyler glances at the driver ID on the back of the seat-- 

     CLOSE ON PHOTO, the man is the RASTA from the airport, with a new
     hairdo.  The COMPANY NAME-- "CONSOLIDATED REGENCY SEDANS."  CRS. 

     SCHUYLER rubs his head, very angry.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Why are you doing this-- 

                             CABBIE/RASTA (filter) 
                     We do it all for you!  We're the best
                     friends you got, no one ever worked 
                     so hard to make you feel alive... but
                     you gotta let it happen...

     The cab STOPS at a RED LIGHT.  SCHUYLER tries the doorhandle-- it
     doesn't work. 

     80.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 

     The cab PEELS OUT when the light turns green, heads for a pier.

     81.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler looks around in increasing panic. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What the fuck is this-- 

                             CABBIE/RASTA
                     Have a nice day...

     The cabbie opens his own door and leaps out of the MOVING CAB-- 

     82.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T 

     The cabbie/rasta hits the ground and ROLLS in a perfect stunt fall.
     The cab rockets to the end of the disused wharf and-- 

     --GOES FLYING off the edge into the San Francisco Bay, illuminated
     by SPOTLIGHTS from the end of the wharf.

     83.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler SCREAMS as the cab plunges and HITS the water.

     84.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T 

     The STEAMING cab's nose slowly DIPS below the surface. 

     85.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     FILLING WITH WATER from the car's floor, from overhead.  EERIE 
     LIGHT from the front of the cab.  Schuyler tries to roll down the 
     window, the handle SPINS, nothing happens.

     86.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T

     The cab GOES UNDER with a BURBLE of BUBBLES.

     87.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler CRANKS the other window handle desperately, now up to his
     waist in water, water GUSHING IN now.  INCREASING BLACKNESS through
     the windows as he sinks.  The handle falls off in his hand.

     88.  U N D E R W A T E R   S H O T  -  N I G H T 

     The sinking cab, HEADLIGHTS and INTERIOR LIGHTS STILL ON, Schuyler 
     inside KICKING at the windows and the Plexi, without any success.

     89.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler stops his frantic kicking, tries to think coolly.  He's up 
     to his neck by now. Angry at himself for not realizing it sooner,
     he pulls what he needs out of his pocket-- the HANDCRANK he found
     in the dumpster.  He takes a deep breath and-- 

     90. SUBMERGES.  UNDERWATER he inserts the crank into the window
     handle hole... a perfect fit.  He CRANKS FAST, WATER FLOODS IN. 

     91.  U N D E R W A T E R   S H O T  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler SLITHERS OUT the open window.  Cheeks puffed out, he kicks
     frantically for the surface. 

     92.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T 

     He BURSTS to the surface, SPLUTTERING, catching his BREATH.  A
     FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him.

                             GIRL 
                     Mister-- are you all right?! 

     Schuyler, treading water, turns around-- 

     A CABIN CRUISER at the dock nearby.  A very beautiful GIRL in a
     yellow rain slicker, holding a powerful FLASHLIGHT leans over the
     edge, tosses him a life preserver, hauls him toward her. 

     93.  E X T .   C A B I N   C R U I S E R  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER clambers onto the rear ladder with the girl's help, teeth
     CHATERING.  HOLD ON the boat's colorfully painted name on the
     stern:  "POSEIDON'S CURSE," and in small letters, "COSTA REY SOL." 

     SCHUYLER boards the large, ritzy craft. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Thank you... I'm very grateful. 

                             GIRL 
                     Shouldn't swim in the Bay, you 
                     could get hepatitis. 

     Schuyler nods, looking around, recovering from the shock.

                             SCHUYLER
                     I have to get in touch with the police.

                             GIRL 
                     You're freezing, I got some dry
                     clothes below. 

     94.  I N T .   B O A T   C A B I N  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler's wet clothes hang from a hook, he's in a towel, starting
     to pull on a fresh set of casual clothes.

                             GIRL
                     Do you need any help? 

     His back is turned as the girl climbs down, opens her raincoat--
     only a STRING BIKINI beneath.  She could be a Playboy centerfold. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Uh, no.  I'm fine.  These fit...
                       (buttoning his pants)
                     ...perfectly. 

     He turns slowly, just as the girl reaches behind her. 

                             GIRL 
                      Sure I can't do something for you? 

     She WINKS as she lets her top drop.  Schuyler smiles strangely. 
     She takes this for lust, approaches him with open arms.  He GRABS
     her by the hair.  Menacingly: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I am finished playing. 

                             GIRL
                     OW!  Let go! 

     She pounds at him, tries to kick.  He wrestles her to the floor,
     kneels on top of her.  He seems about to hit her. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This has got to fucking STOP! 

                             GIRL 
                     You're hurting me! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Who are you!? 

                             GIRL 
                     I just got hired to show you a good
                     time!  C'mon please get off me... 

     Schuyler gets his rage under control, horrified at himself.  He
     climbs off her, she scrambles away, afraid, covering herself.

                             GIRL 
                     I am not into this kinda shit! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Who hired you. 

                             GIRL 
                     I don't know, the service set it up. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     The service? 

                             GIRL 
                     Y'know, Fantasy Girls.  They said
                     you had this wild fantasy, I 
                     should just wait in the boat...

     Schuyler realizes he's not going to get anything more out of her,
     pulls on a shirt, grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin. 

     95.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler leaps off onto the wharf.  The girl, pulling the raincoat
     on, leans over the deck. 

                             GIRL
                     Doncha want your thing?  I'm supposed
                     to give you this, this key thingie...

     Schuyler pauses, turns slowly, approaches. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     A key. 

     THE GIRL nods quickly, reaches over the railing to hand him a SMALL
     WOODEN COFFIN with a BLACK BOW and a RED KEY BURNED into the lid. 

                             GIRL 
                     They said you'd figure out what to
                     do with it. 

     SCHUYLER takes it from her gingerly, undoes the bow, opens the lid:

     ANGLE IN COFFIN-- an ornate HATCHET with a KEY DESIGN on the blade.

     SCHUYLER REMOVES it from its QUILTED resting place.  THE GIRL backs
     away, nervous to see SCHUYLER with a weapon. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm supposed to carry a fucking
                     hatchet around...?  Relax.  I
                     don't want it. 

     He drops the AXE and the COFFIN into the water with a SPLASH-- 

     95PT. THEY GO UNDER and DISAPPEAR...

                                                       CUT TO:

     96.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  D A Y 

     Early morning, the RAIN has stopped-- a RAINBOW arcs behind the 
     office building.  TWO COP CARS, marked and unmarked, pull up at the
     curb, lights FLASHING.

     97.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  D A Y 

     Schuyler, in the clothes from the boat, and Plympton, his lawyer,
     are joined at the elevators by two plainclothes detectives--
     BARNETT and GALLO-- and two UNIFORMS.

                             PLYMPTON 
                     Thank you for your promptness, 
                     officers.  I'm Robert Plympton,
                     Mr. Van Orton's attorney-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Let's go.  Seventh floor.

     98.  I N T .   C R S   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 

     Schuyler enters, followed by the others.  He stops short, reacts.
     WIDE SHOT reveals-- the same offices, now entirely empty.  The
     partitions, the desks, everything has been removed.  A small amount
     of TRASH is scattered on the floor-- the move was evidently hasty. 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     99. LATER.  UNIFORM #1 SPEAKS into his walkie-talkie, COP TALK; #2
     pokes around in a box full of SHREDDED PAPER; Plympton CONFERS with
     Barnett, nods, then both of them cross to Schuyler, who sits on the
     carpet, back to an empty wall.  Barnett checks his notes. 

                             BARNETT 
                     Management company for the building 
                     said this floor hasn't been rented.  We
                     checked with the Secretary of State and
                     the county recorder, there's no listing
                     of a "consumer research service." 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     Recreation service. 

                             BARNETT 
                     Right.  No sign of the boat or the 
                     girl.  Divers got the cab's vehicle 
                     ID, the company junked it a month ago. 

     Gallo, who'd been talking on a phone IN BG, approaches. 

                             GALLO 
                     The numbers you gave us are 
                     disconnected, sir, this was the only
                     address the phone company had.  And
                     we found your car-- it's in impound. 

                             BARNETT 
                     I'm a little confused as to motive 
                     here.  You said your brother sent you
                     to these people...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It's not his fault, he's unstable,
                     he didn't know what he was doing-- 

                             BARNETT
                     And they were supposed to show you
                     a, a good time? 

                             GALLO 
                       (a cautioning look at Barnett)
                     My guess is this Feingold guy's
                     using an alias... is there anything 
                     else you can tell us about him? 

     Schuyler spots an empty CHINESE FOOD CARTON crumpled in the corner.

     CLOSER as SCHUYLER picks up and fingers the container-- Chinese 
     characters on it, the name TUNG HOY. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     He likes Chinese food...

                             BARNETT 
                     Don't worry, Mr. Van Orton, we'll
                     get these jokers. 

     SCHUYLER nods, unconvinced. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     100(NEW).  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   M A N S I O N  -  D A Y 

     PLYMPTON pulls up in his LEXUS, SCHUYLER gets out wearily. 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     There's clearly a civil case once
                     we locate the defendant...

                             SCHUYLER
                     Whatever. 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     Y'know, Sky, things are quiet 
                     since the closing-- you could take
                     some time off. 

     SCHUYLER sighs and nods, closes the car door and waves good-bye.
     He climbs the steps to his front door and Plympton pulls away.

     101(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER enters and automatically reaches for a LIGHTSWITCH-- 

     BLUE SPARKS leap to his fingers, the switch has been RIPPED OUT, 
     leaving exposed WIRING. 

     SCHUYLER CURSES and shakes his hand out.  He looks around in
     disbelief-- the walls are covered in GRAFFITI. 

     "GAME OVER" is the first one we see in the foyer, above the
     HARLEQUIN, who still sits in the only upright chair... but now a
     GLOSSY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO is stuck in its teeth. 

     SCHUYLER pulls out the picture, looks at it, hand trembling-- 

     A POLICE PHOTO of MR. VAN ORTON, his body sprawled in a pool of 
     blood.  It's stamped "PROPERTY SFPD" in red...

                             SCHUYLER
                     Oh, God-- 

     SCHUYLER tosses the picture aside, moves into his living room--

     101B(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  D A Y

     More GRAFFITI everywhere:  "FUCK THE POLICE," "SORE LOSER!," "NO 
     FUTURE," "CRS RULES," assorted OBSCENITIES.  BOOM, as Schuyler
     moves through the living room, CONTACT EXPLOSIVES on the floor
     EXPLODE beneath his feet, making him LEAP and DANCE. 

     OVER THE MANTLEPIECE, A NOTE is stuck into a PAINTING with a
     KITCHEN-KNIFE.  SCHUYLER approaches and rips this down. 

     INSERT NOTE, PAN DOWN SLOWLY, X-CLOSE:  "Like my father before me,
     I kill what I love.  Goodbye, cruel world, blah blah blah..."  A
     RED SIGNATURE ARROW is affixed by a DOTTED LINE at the bottom,
     "PLEASE SIGN HERE."

     SCHUYLER GROANS and crumples the note.  He reaches for a phone-- he
     PICKS up the receiver, it's been MELTED into the body of the 
     telephone.  He throws it aside.  He hears VOICES from the next 
     room, enters cautiously, picking up a SMALL SCULPTURE as a weapon-- 

     lOlC(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   S T U D Y  -  D A Y 

     THE TELEVISION is on, playing a silly-looking CARTOON.  ACTION
     HEROS fly through the air, shooting LIGHT from their eyeballs, etc. 

     SCHUYLER lowers his weapon, moves to shut off the tube.  More
     GRAFITTI over the walls, the books, etc.:  stick figure drawings of
     a MAN HANGING HIMSELF, a BROKEN HEART, a PENIS, a NAKED WOMAN, etc.
     Across the walls, over the TV, are the words, "YOU ARE NOT ALONE."

     SCHUYLER presses the on-off switch-- nothing happens. 

                             ACTION HERO (on TV)
                     Don't touch that dial, Sky! 

     ON SCREEN, THE MASKED ACTION HERO stands proudly, hands on hips,
     before a colorful MOVING BACKGROUND.  It speaks in a cheezy HE-MAN
     VOICE, an ANIMATED MOUTH.  There's a CRS LOGO on its chest. 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Boy oh boy, you fucked up big-time! 
                     Bringing in the cops-- real mistake! 

     SCHUYLER covers his eyes, leans against a chair; this is too much. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     No no no-- 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Oh you're always so negative...

     Schuyler realizes this is a two-way conversation as the CRS-MAN
     WINKS at him, making a stiff WAVE. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     You people are insane...

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Hey, look who's talking to their
                     TV set. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     How did you do this, how did you
                     get in here? 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Simple, we duped your keys the day you
                     came in for your physical, wired the
                     whole house while you were at work. 
                     You rich people all have alarms, but
                     you never set 'em, do you? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, at least leave my brother 
                     alone, he's fragile enough as it is-- 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Don't worry about him, he's just
                     playing his own game-- at a more
                     advanced level, you might say... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You can't just fuck with people
                     like this, you don't know who
                     you're dealing with! 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV)
                             (LAUGHS) 
                     We know exactly who we're dealing
                     with, that's the whole idea!  For
                     a guy with your test scores, 
                     you're pretty slow on the uptake. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What the fuck do you want from me?! 

                             CRS-MAN (on TV) 
                     Sky, I just came to say good- 
                     bye... Too bad it didn't work
                     out, better luck next time.  Uh, 
                     there might be a few loose ends 
                     for you to tie up, but remember--
                     it's not whether you win or lose 
                     that counts, it's how you play the
                     game... ya big loser you... 

     THE SCREEN IMPLODES as SCHUYLER SMASHES IT with the sculpture-- 

                             CRS-MAN (filter) 
                     Ouch!  Take it easy, my hot-headed friend! 

     Schuyler peers into the SMOKING electronics, pulls out a battery
     pack, a small video camera, a loop antenna; the SPEAKER's not dead. 

                             CRS-MAN (filter) 
                     Holy smoke, this was an expensive TV-- 

     He BASHES the equipment repeatedly on the floor with all his might.
     The speaker SPUTTERS OUT, the CRS-MAN'S VOICE at last SILENCED. 

     The PHONE has started ringing during the above.  Schuyler,
     breathless, moves around the room now, trying to find it.  He
     finally tracks it down in the bottom of a GARBAGE CAN, covered with
     disgusting SLIME which he wipes on his shirt. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     Now what?!

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     Yeah, who's this? 

                             MANAGER (filter) 
                     I'm calling from the Claremont 
                     Hotel in Berkeley... we have your 
                     American Express card, you left it
                     at the check-in desk...

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     What?  That's impossible, I've
                     never stayed there-- 

                             MANAGER (filter)
                     Are you sure, sir? 

     SCHUYLER pulls his wallet, spreading his credit cards on the floor. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Son of a bitch.

     START ON THE DUMMY, propped in a chair-- SCHUYLER seizes it,
     SMASHES IT against the wall, the glass head SHATTERS.

     LATE AFTERNOON, the COMPANY LIMO pulls up and Schuyler emerges.

     102B(NEW).  I N T .   C L A R E M O N T   H O T E L  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER crosses the opulent lobby to the desk.  A passing BELLHOP
     gives him a nod and a smile. 

                             BELLHOP 
                     Hello, Mr. Van Orton. 

     Schuyler stares after the bellhop, whom he's clearly never seen
     before.  He proceeds to the check-in desk.  Before he can even 
     introduce himself, the DESK CLERK turns to him with a tight smile-- 

                             DESK CLERK 
                     Mr. Van Orton.  Here's your credit
                     card... and the maid found this
                     under the bed... 

     From under the desk he removes a small ATTACHE CASE, places it
     gingerly in front of Schuyler. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     That isn't mine. 

                             DESK CLERK 
                     It has your initials on it, sir. 

     SCHUYLER examines the case closely for the first time, sees the
     gold monogram, "S. V. O." 

                             DESK CLERK 
                     We'd just as soon you took it with
                     you, in any event... and in the
                     future, you might consider 
                     choosing another hotel for your...

     The man trails off and moves away. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I've never been here before in my life! 

     The man ignores him now.  Schuyler pockets his credit card, thinks
     a beat, then grabs the briefcase.

     JACK drives, Schuyler in back, studying the open briefcase in his 
     lap.  He seems extremely upset, fighting to maintain his wits...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Jack... the woman you took home 
                     the other night, where did you go? 

                             JACK 
                           (puzzled) 
                     Out to Concord... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I know, what was the address? 

     JACK is a bit nervous, he doesn't want to piss off the boss. 

                             JACK 
                     Mmm... it was... Beulah Drive, I
                     think, yeah, offa Oakdale... but
                     didn't you-- never mind. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What? 

                             JACK 
                     Just-- I thought you followed us 
                     there.  There was a black 500SE behind
                     us the whole way, I just assumed...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Shit.  Shit!  It wasn't me, Jack. 

                             JACK 
                     Of course, sir.  It was a white 
                     house, I remember... big tree in
                     the front... with one of those,
                     you know, tire swings...

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Jack, I'm serious.  It wasn't me. 

                             JACK 
                     It wasn't you, sir.

     Schuyler looks at the man, who stares straight ahead, not believing 
     him for a second.  Schuyler shakes his head, looks down at the open
     briefcase in his lap. 

     ANGLE IN BRIEFCASE-- a set of HANDCUFFS, assorted BONDAGE GEAR...
     and a few BLURRY POLAROID PHOTOS, showing a NAKED WOMAN with a
     LEATHER MASK chained to a bed.  ONE SHOT shows her shoulder
     clearly-- we see a ROSE TATTOO.

     A female IMPOUND WORKER with paperwork leads SCHUYLER through a
     maze of SMASHED CARS, etc.  IN BG, the COMPANY LIMO pulls away. 

                             IMPOUND WORKER 
                     Triple A changed your tire... bad
                     blow-out was it?  Anyone hurt? 

     Schuyler shakes his head.  They've reached his MBZ.

                             IMPOUND WORKER 
                     Oh.  Just... we were a little curious
                     about the mess in the back... 

     SCHUYLER bends down to look in the window. 

     HIS POV-- THE BACKSEAT has been SLASHED.  A few SPLASHES OF BLOOD,
     not too much.  Schuyler's HARVARD SWEATSHIRT is torn and STAINED
     with blood, crumpled in a corner of the seat. 

     SCHUYLER swallows, recovers quickly. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     A friend's dog-- he'd been hit by a
                     car, I drove him to the vet...
                        (as the cop nods slowly) 
                     Golden retriever, beautiful animal. 

                             IMPOUND WORKER 
                        (handing Sky a receipt)
                     He OK? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Too early to say. 

     He quickly gets behind the wheel. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     108.  E X T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   N E I G H B O R H O O D / H O U S E  -  E V E N I N G

     SCHUYLER'S MBZ cruises past rows of similar-looking, lower-middle- 
     class homes, a pretty shabby neighborhood.  He parks the Benz.  A
     WHITE VAN is parked just up the street, a LOOP AND RABBIT EAR on
     the roof.  PAN to show THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR... A cartoonish logo
     with the CRS MAN holding a wrench by a TV SET in front of a
     RAINBOW, the words "CABLE REPAIR SPECIALISTS."

     ON THE HOUSE, MOVE from a WHITEWALL TIRE hanging on a rope from a
     tree to SCHUYLER as he RINGS the front doorbell of a WHITE HOUSE. 

     AT THE DOOR, an older, working-class man in a T-shirt appears--
     Christine's dad, MR. KAMINSKY.

                             MR. KAMINSKY 
                     Yes? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mr. Kaminsky?  Schuyler Van Orton-- 

                             MR. KAMINSKY 
                     Is that a name?  Look, I'm kinda busy.
                       (starts to close the door) 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You have a daughter named 
                     Christine?  I'm afraid she might
                     be in danger. 

     MR. KAMINSKY narrows his eyes at him as we hear--

                             CHRISTINE (O. S.)
                     Daddy?  Who is it? 

     Schuyler, very surprised, peers around Mr. Kaminsky-- 

     109.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  E V E N I N G 

     Schuyler does a double-take as CHRISTINE comes down the staircase,
     wearing a sweatshirt and shorts.  She lights up when she sees him, 
     then quickly hides her excitement. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Sky?  Hi, Sky. 

     MR. KAMINSKY allows the relieved Schuyler to enter now. 

                             DAD 
                     Well, I'm gonna get back to that
                     carburetor... nice meeting you. 

     Christine's dad WINKS at his daughter as he moves back to the
     basement.  She rolls her eyes, but mouths, "thanks," and then moves
     to sit beside Schuyler in the modest, over-knick-knacked living
     room:  religious pictures and statues, family photos, etc. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I didn't think I'd-- what are you
                     doing here? 

     SCHUYLER is smiling at himself now, shaking his head.  Christine
     reaches across him to FLIP ON a lamp. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Last night, when Jack dropped you
                     off-- did anything happen? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No... unfortunately.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I thought-- eh, you don't wanna know. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Come on-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I thought they kidnapped you,
                     tortured you-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     What?  Who? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     CRS... I saw pictures, girl with a
                     tattoo on her shoulder like yours-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                        (touches her shoulder) 
                     Ssh, my folks don't know about
                     that yet.  So, what-- they wanted
                     ransom from you or something? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, I thought they were trying to 
                     frame me, they planted evidence... 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Why would they do that? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I have no idea, nothing they do makes any
                     sense.  Forget it, it's just a game. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     So that's the only reason you came 
                     out here to East Hell, your stupid
                     goddamn game. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I was worried about you.  I wanted to
                     see you again.

                             CHRISTINE 
                       (thinks for a beat) 
                     If you pretend to mean that, I'll 
                     pretend to believe it.  Well, looks like
                     your pals are trying to keep us 
                     together.  Buy me dinner at least? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Sure, why not. 

                             CHRISTINE
                             (rises) 
                     I look like a slob, let me change. 

     She hurries upstairs.  Schuyler sighs, wondering what the hell he's
     doing here.  He glances at a VIRGIN MARY statue, squints-- then
     unscrews the head, it's a decanter.  He takes a sniff and puts it
     back with a bemused expression.  He takes another sniff, noticing
     something else in the air...

     A WISP OF SMOKE rises from the lamp Christine turned on. 

     SCHUYLER peers beneath the shade.  On the table is a framed
     PHOTOGRAPH of a LITTLE GIRL who could be Christine in a frilly
     white dress, holding flowers. 

     ANGLE INSIDE LAMPSHADE-- a new PRICETAG dangles from the shade
     against the bulb, starting to TURN BROWN, smoking. 

     SCHUYLER licks his fingertips, reaches inside the shade to PULL OFF
     tag-- in doing so, he burns his fingers on the hot bulb, STIFLES a
     curse and jerks his hand away.  He KNOCKS OVER the picture, which
     FALLS to the floor.  Shaking his hand, he rises distractedly, pokes
     his head through a swinging door. 

     110.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T 

     DIMLY LIT from outside.  Modest, surface clutter, hanging pots,
     etc.  Schuyler moves to a sink, turns on the tap and RUNS WATER 
     over his burned fingertips.  He SHUTS OFF the tap, looks around for
     a towel, shaking his hand-- the paper towel dispenser has no roll
     on it.  He pulls open a kitchen drawer--

     ANGLE IN DRAWER-- completely empty.

     SCHUYLER, curious now, opens a cabinet, absently drying his hand on
     his shirt-- also empty.  He tries another couple of drawers, finds
     nothing but scraps of paper, matches.  No utensils.  He exits, a
     disturbing thought forming. 

     111.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  N I G H T

     SCHUYLER picks up the photo to replace it on the table. 

     ANGLE ON PHOTO:  Schuyler slips the picture from its cardboard 
     mount-- it's an ADVERTISEMENT clipped from a glossy magazine, TEXT
     printed on the portion previously unseen. 

     SCHUYLER quickly returns the clipping to its mount, puts the photo
     back on the table as Christine comes downstairs, dressed and made-
     up for a night on the town. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Can you get us into Chez Panisse?  I
                     always wanted to eat there-- 

     Schuyler nods casually toward the photo as she sits beside him. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Is that you? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                          (quick glance) 
                     Mm-hmm, First Communion.
                        (touches his hair) 
                     What's the matter, you look a 
                     little green around the gills-- 

     He grabs her hand away.  Icily:

                             SCHUYLER
                     Don't touch me. 

     His tone alarms her-- he stares at her with hatred.  A silent BEAT
     between them, each tries to assess the new situation.  She realizes
     he's onto her.  She swallows, makes a quick decision.  Suddenly she
     leans close to him, reaching around him to SHUT OFF the table lamp.
     She leaves her arms around him and HISSES in his ear-- she drops
     her lower-class accent, speaks in a clipped, educated voice: 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Don't be stupid.  Don't say anything,
                     not here, they're watching. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (sickened; to himself)
                     God damn it... 

     She kisses him, he doesn't open his mouth, neither shuts their
     eyes.  Then she gets up quickly, moves to a corner of the room. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                       (back in character, accented) 
                     OK, I know a good place we could
                     go and like, be alone...

     She glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling-- 

     ON CEILING, a large SMOKE DETECTOR with a RED LIGHT, a cable from
     it-- there's a small LENS in the center... A HIDDEN CAMERA. 

     SCHUYLER looks at this, starting to rise.  She moves to a window,
     out of range of the camera, beckons him over. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     It's a beautiful night, isn't it? 

     Schuyler comes up beside her, she nods for him to look outside--

     POV-- THROUGH WINDOW-- the CRS VAN.  Christine WHISPERS urgently: 

                             CHRISTINE
                     There's four of them in the van,
                     they're armed.  Just play along,
                     I'll get us out of here-- 

     SCHUYLER turns to her, his voice is tired. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fuck you. 
                      (to surveillance camera) 
                     OK, that's it, game over-- 

     112.  I N T .   C R S   V A N  -  N I G H T 

     CLOSE on a video monitor, Schuyler framed in a FISHEYE SHOT:

                             SCHUYLER (FILTER) 
                     --you can come out now, assholes-- 

     He moves toward the front door, a panicked Christine behind him--

                             RASTA MAN'S VOICE 
                     We're blown, let's do it-- 

     We hear MEN GETTING TO THEIR FEET, see BODIES MOVE in FG. 

     113.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  N I G H T

     Christine's furious and terrified, dashes in front of him, LOCKS 
     and THROWS A CHAIN across the front door. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You idiot!  Come on!

     She starts to pull him away from the door, he throws off her arm. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No, enough already.  I've had it. 

     He goes to the window and opens the curtain. 

     THROUGH WINDOW-- the Hack/Cabbie, the Rasta/Pilot and a pair of CRS
     AGENTS (JOHN and PETER from the men's club) hurry toward the house,
     the older men reach inside their jackets-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Now what. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Get away from there!!

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (steps toward her) 
                     Oh, now I suppose they're going to-- 

     THE WINDOWS BLOW IN, GUNFIRE, Christine TACKLES HIM and pulls him
     to the ground as--

     KNICK-KNACKS fly to pieces directly behind where he was standing.

     CHRISTINE AND SCHUYLER keep low as they dash for the kitchen-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Holy shit!! 

     114.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T

     Christine pulls him toward a basement door-- 

     115.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   G A R A G E  -  N I G H T 

     They dash down steps to the darkened one-car garage, mostly empty 
     with a few random tools.  MR. KAMINSKY looks up from a game of
     SOLITAIRE, a day player confused by the sudden commotion. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What is this!? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     God, wake up, it's a con game! 

     THE GARAGE DOOR OPENS, Christine pulls Schuyler against a wall-- 

     A "PARAMEDIC" charges out of the shadows, pulling a handgun--

     IN BG MR. KAMINSKY dives for cover with a frightened NOISE--

     CHRISTINE grabs a WRENCH and CLUBS THE PARAMEDIC, who falls with a
     CRY, clutching his skull.  They hear FOOTSTEPS on the stairs they 
     just came down.  Christine hustles the dazed Schuyler out of there. 

     116.  E X T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     Christine and Schuyler dash for the Benz, climb in and SCREECH OFF.
     CRS MEN run for their van to pursue. 

     117.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler drives for all he's worth, Christine watching behind.

     118.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   S T R E E T S  -  N I G H T

     A brief CHASE, the van pursues the MBZ. 

     119.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

     Christine turns forward, her eyes widen--

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Watch out!!

     120.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 

     The MBZ SIDESWIPES a car as Schuyler runs a light, his WINDSHIELD
     CRACKS, the side of the car's CRUNCHED IN, but he keeps driving. 
     He crosses lanes directly in front of an oncoming TRUCK-- the VAN
     HITS THE BRAKES to avoid getting squashed. 

     Schuyler SKIDS into a narrow alley.  THE VAN, having lost a half a
     block, misses this and continues straight. 

     121.  I N T .   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

     Christine's looking behind as Schuyler drives.

                             CHRISTINE
                     OK, we lost 'em-- 

     She's THROWN FORWARD as Schuyler SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, reaches 
     across her and THROWS OPEN the passenger door, which CREAKS from 
     the collision.  He gives her a shove, she clings to the doorframe-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What are you doing!? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Get out of my car. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I coulda handed you to them!  They
                     find me now I'm dead-- 

     Schuyler pushes harder. 

     122.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   A L L E Y  -  N I G H T

     Christine tumbles into the wet gutter.

                             CHRISTINE
                     Listen to me you bastard-- I know
                     what's going on!  No one else is
                     gonna tell you! 

     Schuyler pulls the door shut, the car starts BACKING AWAY. 
     Christine gets to her feet, looks after him.  He reaches the end of
     the alley and stops-- then SCREECHES FORWARD.  She jumps to the 
     edge of the alley, fearing he's trying to run her down.  Schuyler
     HITS THE BRAKES a few feet away.  He leans across, calls to her. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Get in. 

     123.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You can talk while I drive to the
                     police station. 

     Christine puts a hand on the wheel before he can back up again. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     No cops, I got an outstanding warrant.
                        (off his look) 
                     Mail fraud.  I'll get nailed, but 
                     you'll never be able to prove a thing.
                     Just drive. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     124.  E X T .   H I G H W A Y  -  N I G H T 

     The MBZ SPEEDS out of a tunnel on the highway toward SF.

     125.  I N T .   M B Z  -  N I G H T 

     Christine looks out the side window, lights a cigarette.

                             CHRISTINE
                     Heard about this big swindle and--
                     I needed the money.  You wouldn't
                     know what that's like. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Spare me the snide comments.  And
                     please don't do that in here-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Second-hand smoke is the least of
                     your problems. 
                        (blows it in his face) 
                     Shit, they really screwed up, I can't
                     believe they didn't take the time to
                     get the house right. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Wait, how did-- before the game,
                     you were working in that bar-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     They planted me in advance, your
                     brother set you up. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Oh God, David's in on it...? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     It's not his fault, he thought it was 
                     the only way out... just another victim. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     How the hell did they think they 
                     were gonna get my money?

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Honey, they already got it. 

     She gives him a pitying look.  Schuyler throws her a sidelong
     glance; this is absurd.  She gestures at his car phone. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You don't believe me, check your 
                     bank accounts.  Listen, that night
                     in your office, remember?  I 
                     downloaded files off your computer
                     while you were in the shower...

     CAMERA MOVES IN ON SCHUYLER'S FACE during the following and--

                             CHRISTINE (V. O.) 
                     I stuck in a code-breaking program
                     to glve CRS remote access to Van
                     Orton Group files...

     127. --RAPID INSERTS from the CRS OFFICES-- Schuyler's SIGNATURE, 
     financial FORMS, a TAPE RECORDER, TEST FORMS, etc.

                             CHRISTINE (V. O.) 
                     --you'd already given them everything
                     else they needed.  Your handwriting, 
                     voice samples, personal information, all
                     the tests you took... they used the data
                     to generate your passwords. 

     --ON A CRT SCREEN as various combinations of letters and numbers
     SCROLL BY, too quickly for the eye to read. 

                             CHRISTINE (V. O.) 
                     From there they just had to break into
                     the financial networks, transfer your
                     holdings into some dummy accounts--

                     Remember Jim Feingold, guy who 
                     signed you up?  He's one of the 
                     original hackers, did a five-year
                     stretch for zapping Citibank.

                     the whole show. 

     END SERIES OF SHOTS, DISSOLVE TO: 

     128. SCHUYLER'S FACE... LIGHTS through the FRAGMENTED WINDSHIELD 
     cast weird PATTERNS on it.  He's pumping sweat now, reaches for his
     cell phone, dials, hand shaking.  Christine flicks her cig out the
     window; she sounds regretful. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     I'm sorry.  They already did your
                     brother, I guess they figured you
                     for a family of suckers...

                     Bet you haven't really been taking 
                     care of business the past few days,
                     huh?  This "game," the psych shit
                     about your dad going sui...

                             SCHUYLER (on phone)
                     Guten tag-- Vilen dank, Englisch... 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     All of it was just to buy time,
                     keep you from paying attention... 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     Blue Two-Five... 6-9-0-D... Yes, I
                     consent to voice-print... My name
                     is Schuyler Van Orton.  I'd like 
                     to know my balance, please... that
                     account is closed?! 

                             CHRISTINE (nervously) 
                     I think maybe you should pull over...

     Schuyler sets his jaw, drops the phone-- and turns the wheel hard.

     129.  E X T .   H I G H W A Y  -  N I G H T

     The MBZ SCREECHES for an offramp. 

     130.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler's on his portable phone at a gas station/convenience 
     store, leaning on the Benz as he pumps gas.  Christine stands out
     of earshot, arms folded, staring at the dark horizon. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     Bob, listen carefully, this is an 
                     emergency.  Feingold and his people,
                     I've called all my banks, they've 
                     drained the accounts, personal and 
                     corporate, everything-- tell the cops
                     I've got one of them with me, we'll 
                     make her testify.  They're trying to
                     kill us, I'm heading for the island
                     in Oregon, if I can still find it. 
                     Bob-- call when you get this message
                     and-- be extremely careful... 

     131.  I N T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 

     START ON-- a thermos full of coffee, foodstuffs, miscellaneous 
     camping supplies as a CLERK holds a credit card, hangs up a phone.
     He looks up at SCHUYLER and CHRISTINE.

                             CLERK 
                     They say I gotta confiscate your card... 

     Schuyler sighs, "of course," Christine fishes in her pocket. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     I think I have some cash. 

     132.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 

     They emerge from the store with a couple of grocery bags, Christine
     sucks an ice cream pop.  They toss the bags in the trunk.

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Money isn't everything, right? 

     Schuyler is seething, clutching the trunk lid for a beat, then
     SLAMS it hard when she steps back, making her jump.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     It might be best if you didn't 
                     speak.  I very nearly crushed your
                     skull just now. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     C'mon chill, what'd they take you for, a
                     couple hundred G's?  Chump change for a
                     guy like you, chalk it up to experience. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                       (quietly, restraining himself)
                     Just under a billion dollars. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     A bil--? 
                          (nervous laugh) 
                     You're kidding, right? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Do I look like I'm kidding?
                     This is about more than my 
                     personal lifestyle-- your pals 
                     raided pension plans, charitable
                     foundations, company payrolls...

                             CHRISTINE
                     Oh my God-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't know what kind of jerk-off
                     con games you've played in the 
                     past, but now you're in the big
                     leagues, hon.  You just helped
                     sabotage a small portion of the 
                     national economy-- and destroy a
                     whole lotta lives. 

     He stares at her, she looks sick and truly scared.  He climbs in
     the car.  For once without a comeback, she gets in the car quietly. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     The Benz ZIPS AROUND a logging truck on a DIRT ROAD.

     134.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A W N 

     Schuyler, bleary-eyed, drains coffee from the thermos and tosses it 
     aside.  He glances over at the sleeping Christine, her head tilted
     toward his shoulder; she looks pretty sexy.  He stares at her for a
     moment, SIGHS and turns away. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     A beautiful Northern lake-- dense forests on the mainland, pines 
     and fall foliage.  A STORM coming in, ominous CLOUDS.  The Benz is
     parked at the shoreline.  MOVE TO FIND Schuyler and Christine, as
     they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly
     humble, somewhat decrepit cabin on it.  A FLASH OF LIGHTNING. 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     136.  I N T .   O R E G O N   C A B I N  -  D A Y

     CHRISTINE pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood-burning
     stove in which a FIRE CRACKLES.  This cabin is genuinely rustic and
     run-down-- hewn wood, fishing rods, cobwebs, rain damage, dust.
     WATER DRIPS from the ceiling in a few places.  LIGHTNING FLASHES in
     BG through the scene, the STORM has gotten pretty bad. 

     SCHUYLER finishes taking out his contacts, DROPPING them in cups
     full of water. He slips on his glasses, then looks at a few framed
     family photos on the coffee table in front of him.  Christine,
     barefoot, brings him a cup of coffee, which he sips gratefully. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're not having any? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Never drink it.  Makes my tits hurt. 

     Schuyler gives her a sidelong glance, looks back at a photo. 

     ON PHOTO-- he rubs away the dust from a shot showing Schuyler's
     father, with young Schuyler, on a boat with fishing equipment. 

     CHRISTINE takes a step and CRIES out, clutching her foot and 
     sitting beside Schuyler.  A small FISHHOOK protrudes from her foot, 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Hold still. 

     He talks while he carefully removes the hook from her foot. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Sorry, this place hasn't been cleaned
                     in a while.  My dad built it himself,
                     spent a lot of time here alone.
                         (regards a LEAK)
                     Rotten carpenter...

     He pulls out the hook, puts it aside; she rubs her foot. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Thank you. 

     SCHUYLER suddenly starts LAUGHING, wipes tears from his eyes. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     What's so funny? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Just-- private joke...

                             CHRISTINE
                     Tell me. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Well... I always told myself I 
                     wasn't gonna end up like him.  And
                     now here I am, running his 
                     corporation, living in his house,
                     hiding in the cabin where he went
                     to hide right before he... I even
                     look like the bastard. 

     Christine looks at the photo of MR. VAN ORTON, then at Schuyler. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Not that much. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Mm, plus I'm a helluva lot more
                     gullible than he ever was...

     THE CELL-PHONE CHIRPS, Schuyler shakes off his self-pity, snatches
     up the handset. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Yes. 

     CHRISTINE mouths, "Who is it?" 

                             PLYMPTON (filter) 
                       (careful, worried)
                     It's me, Schuyler... I got your message... 
                     I'll admlt, I was very disturbed... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                        (hand over phone)
                     My, lawyer. 
                          (to Plympton)
                     So.  What's our next move? 

     During the following, Christine's eyes go wide, she shakes her head
     frantically, draws a finger across her throat-- 

                             PLYMPTON (filter) 
                     I've been on the phone all morning... your
                     funds are intact, nothing's changed, 
                     there's been no activity whatsoever...

     SCHUYLER struggles to absorb the import of this as well as
     Christine's behavior.  She shakes her head with a sigh, rises to
     refill his coffee cup. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Wait-- that's not true-- 

                             PLYMPTON (filter)
                             (firmly) 
                     It is true, no one is after your 
                     money, no one is trying to hurt you-- 

     SCHUYLER looks at Christine with horror.  She nods and WHISPERS: 

                             CHRISTINE
                     He's in on it. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Oh, God...

                             PLYMPTON (filter)
                     Listen to me, Sky! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What are they paying you, Robert?
                     Piece of the action? 

                             PLYMPTON (filter) 
                     Schuyler!  Look, you've done the 
                     right thing going up there, maybe 
                     it's best if you just sit tight for
                     a while, forget about everything,
                     it's all under control-- 

     Schuyler HANGS UP, breathing hard, pacing, clutching the phone. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     We have to get out of here! 

     Christine approaches him with a fresh cup of coffee, which he sips.
     The PHONE CHIRPS again, Schuyler THROWS it violently against the 
     wall, it's silenced.  He gulps more coffee, rising again, looking
     at the smashed phone, sickened by his own loss of control. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Well, that was stupid. 

     Christine watches him closely.  He keeps balling his hands into
     fists as he paces, trying to think out his next play. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     OK, they've gotten to him.  OK.
                     Is there anyone I can trust? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Mm... I wouldn't worry about it. 

                             SCHUYLER
                             (a beat) 
                     What do you mean? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     It's out of your hands. 

     He takes a step, stumbles, shakes his head to clear it.  She rises,
     picks up his half-empty cup and heads for the kitchen area.  His
     gaze follows this, he realizes he's been drugged. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Christine!!

                             CHRISTINE 
                     That's not my name. 

     With a CRY OF RAGE he lunges after her, but CRASHES into the wall,
     clutching at a hanging ROD, which falls when he does-- he KNOCKS
     OVER the table of photos as he goes down, PANTING for air like a
     fish out of water, clutching his stomach, nauseated. 

     HIS POV-- SIDEWAYS, LOW ANGLE.  SFX, BLOOD POUNDING in his head.
     Schuyler's eyes FOLLOW the GROOVES of the wet, warped hardwood
     floor, they lead to-- and almost seem to point to-- Christine. 

     ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE-- from the counter she picks up a small vial
     with a bit of powder at the bottom, slips it into her pocket. 

     SCHUYLER's eyes roll into his head as he struggles against the
     effects, tries to get to his hands and knees.  He gasps:

                             SCHUYLER
                     Why...

     CHRISTINE approaches, stands a few feet away, lights a cigarette, 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     We needed you to call your banks. 
                     Cellular calls can be intercepted,
                     rerouted, y'know.

     She crouches by him, flicking ashes a few inches from his nose. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     All those calls to Switzerland and 
                     Chase Manhattan-- you were talking to
                     our people.  See, we were still
                     missing a lotta pieces-- access 
                     codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton
                     didn't have-- but now we have 
                     I everything.  I guess you are pretty
                     fucking stupid-- but thanks. 

     He CLAWS at her helplessly with a GROAN, but misses.  His glasses
     fall off, he collapses again.

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- everything a BLUR NOW, except in EXTREME FG-- the 
     photo of himself and his father, which now lies on the floor.

     137. FLASH-CUT TO:  FLASHBACK POV-- THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, as MR. 
     VAN ORTON'S FACE SMASHES into the ground, his GLASSES SHATTERING,
     BLOOD SPRAYING from his head. 

     138. CUT BACK TO:  SCHUYLER writhes, fighting the drug. 

     139. FLASH-CUT TO:  The moment of his father's jump-- only in this
     HALLUCINATION, SCHUYLER himself wears the robe, leaps into space. 

     140. SCHUYLER'S POV-- FROM FLOOR-- Christine moves INTO FOCUS,
     crouches near him, studying her victim almost clinically. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     It's over.  Just let go...

     The SFX POUNDING STOPS, and-- 

                                                  CUT TO BLACK

     BREATHING... THEN SCREAMING, POUNDING and KICKING...

     141.  I N T .   C R Y P T  -  D A Y 

     A WOODEN LID SPLINTERS as SCHUYLER pounds his way out of a COFFIN.
     DIM LIGHT through CRACKS in the walls, this is an old and moldering
     MAUSOLEUM, other COFFINS nearby.  FRESH FLOWERS surround his 
     resting place, otherwise everything is completely DECAYED.

     By the time SCHUYLER gets out of the coffin, his arms are BLOODIED.
     He's been dressed in an ALL-WHITE BURIAL SUIT.  A RED ROSE is TAPED
     to his chest.  He blinks and stares about wildly-- 

     HIS POV-- BLURRY, can't make out much. 

     SCHUYLER blinks, breathing hard, utterly freaked.  He notices the
     ROSE on his chest, tears it off, SNIFFS it, then THROWS IT aside
     with a frustrated CRY.  He stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt,
     tugs, then realizes it opens the other way-- he gives it a PUSH-- 

     142.  E X T .   C E M E T E R Y  -  D A Y 

     IT COLLAPSES immediately.  SCHUYLER tumbles out of the crypt into
     the HOT SUNLIGHT.  He's in a ramshackle city of the dead, a SPANISH
     GRAVEYARD.  There are endless rows of TOMBS, rioting tropical
     VEGETATION, many FLOWERS, impossibly bright COLORS.  It should be
     quite beautiful and peaceful...

                             SCHUYLER
                     What? 

     He walks around tentatively, SQUINTING.  AN OLD WOMAN in black sits
     contemplating a grave, fingering her rosary.  SCHUYLER slips a hand
     absently into his pocket, and finds something there, pulls it out-- 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- BLURRY shot of a NOTE in SPANISH, with a KEY on
     the stationery...

     SCHUYLER blinks, slips the note in his pocket. 

                                                       CUT TO: 

     143.  E X T .   C E N T R A L   A M E R I C A N   S T R E E T  -  D A Y 

     TIGHT SHOT on Schuyler blinking, disoriented, JOSTLED by a sea of 
     HISPANIC PEOPLE on this busy street. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- WALKING TENUOUSLY.  The world's a BLUR, FACES move
     in and out of FOCUS.  They're dark, foreign, many POOR PEOPLE, 
     poverty-scarred features.  Scraps of SPANISH.  He grabs a DARK MAN.

                             SCHUYLER
                     Where am I?! 

     The man replies with an EXCLAMATION in SPANISH, pushes Schuyler
     away, CAMERA TUMBLES-- 

     OBJECTIVE SHOT-- Schuyler's on his knees in the middle of this
     third-world thoroughfare, utterly disoriented.  STREET VENDORS sell
     weird-looking foods, squads of SQLDIERS march with rifles, 
     MUSICIANS PLAY odd instruments... Schuyler clutches his head, as if
     trying to wish it all away. 

     A COP IN BEIGE UNIFORM suddenly prods at him with a nightstick,
     YELLING AT HIM in SPANISH to move on. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- the COP looming over him, a BLURRY menace, the end
     of the nightstick SHARP in FG as it POKES at him. 

     ANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler pleads with the man: 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Please, help me, I'm an American!
                     I'm lost!  Please!! 

     This doesn't seem to help.  He tries to get away from the stick,
     but the cop pursues.  He bangs into people as he tries to move
     quickly, the stick right behind him. 

     Schuyler FALLS over a BEGGAR on the ground, in far worse shape than
     he is.  The cop YELLS at him.  Schuyler covers his head, holding 
     out the NOTE WITH THE KEY, which the cop finally snatches away.  He
     studies it for a moment, then BARKS with LAUGHTER. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- the cop reaches down to him-- 

     OBJECTIVE ANGLE-- Schuyler cringes, expecting a blow, but the cop
     just pulls him to his feet.  He drags him away with him, speaking
     more gently IN SPANISH, amused.  Schuyler nods thankfully. 

     HIGH ANGLE-- the THRONGS on this crowded street. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     144.  I N T .   F O R E I G N   P O L I C E   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y 

     A DESK SERGEANT studies the note, approaching SCHUYLER, whose face
     is now red, SUNBURNT.  He sits on a bench with a VAGRANT or two.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Hello.  Where am I? 

                             DESK SERGEANT
                     Tegucigalpa. 
                       (off Schuyler's blank look)
                     Tegucigalpa.  Tegucigalpa? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     That's gibberish! 

                             DESK SERGEANT
                            (annoyed) 
                     It is the capital of Honduras. 

     SCHUYLER buries his face in his hands, nods.  He's relieved to have
     found an English speaker at least. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Right. 

                             DESK SERGEANT 
                     So-- you have become, lost from,
                     from your father...? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     My father's dead, God damn it.  I have
                     to get to the United States embassy. 

     The sergeant cocks his head, confused.  Indicating the note:

                             DESK SERGEANT 
                     Do you know what this says? 

                                                       CUT TO:

     145.  I N T .   A M E R I C A N   E M B A S S Y   L O B B Y  -  D A Y 

     An Hispanic embassy WORKER behind a desk with a U. S. flag
     TRANSLATES THE NOTE aloud in amazed, unaccented English. 

                             WORKER 
                     "I am an American.  I am an idiot.
                     My father is very rich.  If I 
                     become lost, please take me to the
                     police.  There is a reward." 

     ANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler, utterly humiliated, sits in a chair on
     the other side of the desk. 

                             WORKER 
                     Mr. Van Orton... is this a joke of 
                     some sort?  What are you doing here? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     I don't know. 

                             WORKER 
                             (a beat) 
                     Well, without any identification it 
                     will take at least a week to get you
                     a temporary visa-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                             (rising) 
                     A week?!  Christ knows what they
                     can do in a week-- and what the
                     hell am I supposed to, to live
                     on?!  What day is it anyway? 
                        (squints at his watch, thinks)
                     Where's the nearest pawn shop? 

                                                       CUT TO:

     146.  I N T .   W E I R D   B O D E G A  -  D A Y 

     A middle-aged Latina-- the BODEGA LADY-- counts out a stack of
     bills on the counter, beside Schuyler's watch.  Her store displays
     JEWELRY, KNIVES, MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, as well as mystical CANDLES,
     POTIONS and BOTTLES with DEAD ANIMALS in formaldehyde. 

                             PAWN SHOP OWNER 
                     This will buy you a plane ticket.

     On the other side of the counter, SCHUYLER Sorts through A BOX OF
     EYEGLASSES, trying on different pairs. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yeah, well I, I seem to have lost my
                     passport... 

     The pawn shop owner nods knowingly.  There's one other CUSTOMER, a
     shabbily-dressed but honest-looking HONDURAN MAN, looking through a
     BIN full of sports equipment.  He seems to have been eavesdropping,
     the pawn shop owner now exchanges a few words with him IN SPANISH,
     clearly they're coming to some kind of deal.  Meanwhile, Schuyler
     puts on a rhinestone-studded pair of woman's glasses, looks around. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Huh, close enough...

                             PAWN SHOP OWNER
                     I throw them in.

                     This man says he can help you...

     Schuyler narrows his eyes at the Honduran man, who flashes a
     crooked-toothed smile.

     A large, covered STAKE TRUCK RUMBLES BY on a hilly jungle highway.

     In the back of the truck, Schuyler rides among HUNDREDS OF BAGS of
     COFFEE BEANS, marked "CAFE, PRODUCTO DE HONDURAS."  He wears the
     silly rhinestone glasses, as well as cheap new clothes-- shorts, a
     Spanish message T-shirt, sneakers.  He munches on a mango, peeks
     out a hole in the tarp at the passing scenery.

     HIS POV-- a VISTA of spectacular beauty, ideally jungle-encrusted
     MAYAN RUINS against the backdrop of the rising sun. 

     SCHUYLER's quite taken with the view, despite his troubles.

     The stake truck is parked at a U. S. BORDER CROSSING in the desert. 
     The Honduran man-- the truck's driver-- shows his papers to an
     INSPECTOR as he walks him to the back of the IDLING truck. 

     ANGLE FROM INSIDE TRUCK as a tarp is lifted.  The inspector glances
     inside, examines a couple of COFFEE BAGS.  IN FG, Schuyler hides
     below a bag or two, holding his breath.  The tarp falls again,
     Schuyler exhales with relief in the darkness.

     MOS, SCHUYLER has been reduced to pan-handling for bus fare in 
     front of a San Antonio BUS STATION.  An OLDER MAN takes pity, gives
     him a bill, he moves on to a couple who shake their heads and avoid
     looking at him.  He hurries off at the sight of a disapproving COP.

     POLARIZE to show SCHUYLER through the bus window, exhausted, numbly
     taking in the glorious view.

     All seems quiet, the house dark-- late at night.  There's a 
     movement in the bushes near the street-- SCHUYLER emerges, on the 
     lookout for any surveillance.  It seems safe.  He digs out a hidden
     KEY from within a FAKE ROCK then goes to the front door, gathers up
     NEWSPAPERS and a thick stack of MAIL from his box.  He flips 
     through it quickly, finds a postcard that interests him and shoves
     it in his pocket-- the rest of the mail he leaves in the box.  He 
     punches in his code on the alarm pad, unlocks the door and enters. 

     CLOSE ON ALARM PAD-- the light goes from GREEN to RED.

     152.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER blinks as he enters the house-- the graffiti is gone, the 
     mess cleared up, it actually looks cleaner than ever. 

     QUICK SHOTS, JUMP-CUTS, the rhythm jarring.  LIGHTS LOW throughout,
     Schuyler wants to attract as little attention as possible... 

     152A(NEW). IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER gobbles handfuls of dry cereal,
     grabs for anything he can find in the refrigerator. 

     153. IN THE SHOWER, Schuyler scrubs away the grime.

     154. IN THE BATHROOM, he inserts a CONTACT LENS. 

     154A. IN A DESK DRAWER he finds a few $20.00 bills. 

     154B. IN THE BEDROOM-- Schuyler changes into jeans and a sport
     jacket, tucking the MONEY and the POSTCARD into the pockets.  As he
     turns to leave, he spots something on his dresser-- 

     A WHITE ENVELOPE, with a handwritten "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN..."

     SCHUYLER frowns at this. tears it open. reacts with fear...

     155. IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER holds the handwritten note to the 
     BLUE FLAME.  He tosses the BURNING PAGE into the sink. 

     CLOSE SHOTS on the curling, burning note, we make out KEY WORDS: 

     "MY FATHER WAS RIGHT," "NO REASON TO CONTINUE," "TAKE MY OWN LIFE,"
     "I WANT ONLY DEATH..." and finally the signature, "SCHUYLER VAN
     ORTON..."  This suicide note is no joke. 

     SCHUYLER backs away from the sink.  Quiet, determined:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     No.  Fuck you... I'm going to live...

     156.  I N T .   S T U D Y  -  N I G H T 

     Schuyler moves to a bookshelf, looking for a volume, finds--

     CLOSE-- a large, leather-bound BLACK BOOK with no title. 

     SCHUYLER clutches the volume.  HEADLIGHTS shine in the window, a
     VEHICLE in the drive.  Schuyler moves for a back door.

     157.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 

     A CAR DOOR CLOSES, we see a UNIFORMED FIGURE MOVE O. S., revealing 
     A POLICE STYLE CREST, the words "CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL SECURITY,"
     the initials "CRS" in the center. 

     SCHUYLER, sneaking around the side of the house, takes this in,
     waiting for the RENT-A-COPS with FLASHLIGHTS and WEAPONS to enter
     his house.  Then he hurries away, book under his arm.

     UNDER A STREET LAMP on a hilly street, SCHUYLER reaches into his
     pocket and squints at THE POSTCARD-- 

     INSERT POSTCARD, the message side:  "S - IT'S SAFE HERE - D."  An 
     ARROW points to a printed ADDRESS.  Schuyler FLIPS the card over--
     a PAINTING of a COLONIAL MANSION down a tree-lined DRIVE...

     THE SAME VIEW of the same mansion, a very beautiful, peaceful spot.
     SCHUYLER moves down the drive toward the entrance.  He carries the
     thick book, as he will through following scenes.

     A NURSE leads Schuyler down a door-lined corridor, no one in sight.
     This place turns out to be an incredibly ritzy SANITARIUM. 

                             NURSE 
                     The medication seems to be helping. 
                     Unfortunately we're going to have to
                     transfer your brother to a public 
                     institution in a few days, his funds 
                     are entirely exhausted-- unless you're
                     prepared to take responsibility...

     She KNOCKS at a door, OPENS IT a crack and lets Schuyler in.

     160.  I N T .   S A N I T A R I U M   R O O M  -  D A Y 

     A pleasant bedroom, and safe-- no sharp objects or primary colors 
     in sight, discreet decorative BARS on the window. 

     DAVID, in pajamas, sits in a chair, eating bland food from a 
     plastic lunch tray.  He watches a GOLF MATCH on a tiny WATCHMAN TV,
     we'll hear it IN BG-- CLAPPING, etc.  He doesn't react as Schuyler
     enters, moves to his side. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     David... 

     David turns to him, half-smiles; food particles on his lips. 

                             DAVID
                     Hello Sky...

     Schuyler sits close to David, upset. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What are you doing here? 

                             DAVID 
                     Sorry, I was just eating...  I'm
                     much better.  Really. 

     David does seem in control now, if a little hazy. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Thank God... Listen, I know you put
                     them onto me-- but I understand, 
                     we're both victims of this thing...
                     They've stolen everything we ever
                     had, they're trying to drive us both 
                     crazy-- but we won't let them. 
                     We'll find a way.  There's gotta be 
                     a way to beat these bastards!  We're
                     in it together...

     He clutches his brother's hand.  David narrows his eyes, confused. 

                             DAVID 
                     In what together? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     The game. 

                             DAVID 
                     Oh, Schuyler, there is no game.  It
                     was just a fantasy of mine, a self-
                     aggrandizing delusion... I can't 
                     believe you took that shit seriously. 

                             SCHUYLER
                       (clutching his hand)
                     No, David-- please... 

                             DAVID 
                         (pulling away) 
                     Oh, man, stop fucking with me! 
                     You know the game doesn't exist...
                     it never did!  It never did...

     Schuyler stares at him for a beat-- no getting through.  David
     leans forward, turns UP THE TV VOLUME, aiming the set at Schuyler. 

                             DAVID
                     Can you see? 

     ON SCREEN-- a golf ball rolls on a green and PLOPS into the cup.

     Barnett, the detective from earlier, has come out to the reception 
     area to speak with Schuyler, who's trying very hard to be rational. 

                             BARNETT 
                     So the waitress was in on it--

                             SCHUYLER 
                     She isn't really a waitress. 

                             BARNETT 
                     --and now you're brother's been 
                     institutionalized... is there a history
                     of mental illness in your family? 

     SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the question.  GALLO, beyond a METAL
     DETECTOR in the rear area of the station, gestures to Barnett, who
     holds up a finger. 

                             BARNETT 
                     'Scuse me. 

     Moving away, Barnett glances at the leatherbound book, which
     Schuyler clutches very possessively. 

                             BARNETT 
                     Whatcha reading? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Nothing. 

     Barnett purses his lips, nods, steps around the metal detector to
     chat with Gallo. 

     WITH GALLO AND BARNETT 

                             GALLO 
                     I just spoke with his lawyer 
                     Plympton, he thinks Van Orton's
                     having a nervous breakdown, we 
                     should probably hold onto him till 
                     his people can get down here...

     WITH SCHUYLER as GALLO AND BARNETT glance in his direction, gesture
     for him to approach.  Gallo WINKS casually at Schuyler. 

     SCHUYLER, wary now, moves toward them through the METAL DETECTOR--
     which GOES OFF with a WHINE.  The ALARM MONITOR woman approaches
     with a wand-- but Schuyler steps back, wide-eyed. 

                             ALARM MONITOR
                     Probably just your keys, sir-- 

     SCHUYLER turns and moves quickly for the exit. 

                             BARNETT
                     Yo, Schuyler, wait up-- 

     He's through the door.  The WHINE OF THE DETECTOR continues as we--

     THE WHINE dissolves into the SCREECHING of a TRAIN on an EL TRACK.

     163.  I N T .   B A R T   T R A I N  -  N I G H T 

     LIGHTS FLICKER on and off in a moving train car. 

     SCHUYLER scribbles intently in a brand new kid's school notebook, 
     open in his lap.  He sits at the end of the moderately crowded 
     train car.  Suddenly, he looks up, eyes wild, starts SCANNING the 
     subway car slowly, sensitive to it all.  By now he's definitely the
     sort of person you'd avoid in a public place. 

     INTERCUT POV with his REACTIONS, as everything falls into place in
     his increasingly febrile mind...

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- SLOW PAN OVER the assortment of nighttime RIDERS--
     a couple of TEENAGERS, an OLDER WOMAN with shopping bags, a DRUNK. 

     CAMERA PAUSES on a patch of GRAFITTI:  typically unreadable SCRAWL,
     but the letters could be CRS. 

     CAMERA MOVES to the overhead ADVERTISEMENTS:  one for hemrnorhoids,
     a seasonal bank ad featuring the EASTER BUNNY... PAUSE ON a PHOTO
     of an ecstatic CALIFORNIA LOTTERY WINNER holding up a wad of cash
     with the words "YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU DON'T PLAY."

     A MAN READS the SPORTS PAGE:  "GAME FINAL 23-2." 

     ON THE FLOOR, a CANDY BAR WRAPPER with A GOLD KEY printed on it,
     part of a contest. 

     SCHUYLER picks this up, examines and discards it. 

     SCHUYLER' S POV-- an ELDERLY MAN with a clunky HEARING AID is 
     looking at Schuyler with a blank expression.  The man suffers from
     a facial TWITCH that causes one eye to BLINK rapidly. 

     SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the man, then looks away pointedly.
     He puts the notebook into A PLASTIC BAG.  Beneath it, cradled in
     his lap, is the mysterious black book.  He opens this carefully-- 

     CLOSE, the book is hollow.  Inside is an expensive HANDGUN. 

     WIDE SHOT from the next train car-- A FIGURE IN FG is staring
     through the scratched, fogged window AT SCHUYLER as he puts the
     leather book into the bag with his notebook...

     Schuyler is using the plastic bag and his jacket as a pillow, his 
     eyes closed.  Suddenly there's a KNIFE at his throat. 

                             PUNK
                     End of the line, man. 

     SCHUYLER starts; the PUNK keeps the knife on him.  He's a young,
     glassy-eyed junkie.  He wears a RADIO EARPLUG in one ear, a wire
     heading down to his waist.  Schuyler nods, starts studying the
     man's arms, heavily TATTOOED with crude cabalistic SYMBOLS. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Are the tattoos supposed to mean
                     something? 

                             PUNK 
                       (momentarily thrown) 
                     Yeah, they mean you're dead, you
                     don't gimme what you got. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                      (touches the punk's arm)
                     OK, there's the C... 

                             PUNK 
                     Give me the fucking bag! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (cold, deadly) 
                     Come on, you're not going to put 
                     me through all this shit and then
                     kill me on a fucking train, it
                     won't look like a suicide... 

     As Schuyler speaks he sits up, the PUNK grabs the bag-- Schuyler 
     grabs the guy's knife hand, they wrestle on the floor of the car,
     clawing at each other.  The punk drops the knife, it gets knocked
     beneath the seat, both men reach for it...

                             TRANSIT COP
                     Freeze assholes! 

     Schuyler and the punk look up to see a TRANSIT COP pointing his
     WEAPON.  The punk throws his hands up, scrambles to his feet-- 

                             PUNK 
                     Psycho pulled a knife on me! 

     The cop has grabbed the still prone Schuyler, flipping him over and
     slapping a handcuff on him-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What do you think you're doing,
                     this guy attacked me! 

     The cop has dropped his guard; the punk spins and bolts into the
     next car, squeezing through the door.  The TRANSIT COP hastily
     cuffs Schuyler to an armrest-- 

                             TRANSIT COP
                     Wait here--

     He dashes into the next car after the punk.  Schuyler looks at the
     floor of the car, sees-- 

     THE SMALL RADIO and its EARPLUG attached by a WIRE.  The radio has
     a tiny LOOP/RABBIT EAR antenna on it.  He snatches it up, then
     YANKS at the cuff.  He spots the knife under the seat, grabs it,
     starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post.

     FROM THE NEXT CAR he hears SHOUTS, SCREAMS, a serious commotion
     going on, he doesn't know who's winning.  Schuyler's almost gotten
     free as the TRAIN SLOWS, when-- 

     --the DOOR at the far end of the car opens, it's the PUNK, bruised
     and bloody, ready to kill. 

     He lunges at Schuyler just as he PRIES THE ARMREST off the seat and
     CLOBBERS him with it.  The punk reels back.  The train has stopped,
     the doors have opened-- Schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out
     onto the platform just before they shut again. 

     166.  I N T .   B A R T   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER locks the free cuff on to the same wrist as the other,
     sliding his jacket over them, moving briskly up the stairs. 

     167.  E X T .   B E R K E L E Y   S T R E E T  -  D A Y 

     SCHUYLER emerges and walks quickly, checking over his shoulder,
     BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN.  He fiddles with the RADIO, the
     PLUG to his ear.  We hear STATIC, BLEEPING NOISES, FILTERED VOICES.
     For a few moments the VOICES ON THE RADIO become CLEARER. 

                             RADIO VOICE #1 
                     --can't let him get away with this,
                     he's outta control!  The next thing
                     you know, he'll push the wrong
                     button and we'll all be dead-- 

     SCHUYLER listens intently, leaning against a wall in the shadows,
     breathing hard.  He stares nervously at a couple of nearby STREET
     PEOPLE huddled by a shopping cart, they stare back.  Another VOICE
     on the radio talks OVER the first: 

                             RADIO VOICE #2 
                     --Whoah whoah whoah-- OK the guy's a
                     moron, sure, but he doesn't have the 
                     balls to end the world!  Anyway I'm
                     sicka talking politics, let's get back
                     to the business of nipple piercing--
                     you got a ring, don't ya Robin? 

     We hear the HYSTERICAL GIGGLING of ROBIN QUIVERS.  SCHUYLER blinks,
     recognizing the voice of RADIO DJ HOWARD STERN. 

                             RADIO VOICE #2 (HOWARD STERN)
                     Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this is
                     the Howard Stern show...

     SCHUYLER fiddles frantically with the dial and antennas, calling up
     RANDOM RADIO MUSIC, COMMERCIALS, etc.

     CLOSE ON A TRASH CAN-- Schuyler tosses his hollowed leather book
     into it.  It falls open, we see the gun is gone. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     168(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I C E  -  D A Y 

     TRACK DOWN an institutional corridor, a few EMACIATED PATIENTS in
     wheelchairs... they only come here to die.  ELIZABETH, Schuyler's
     ex, 4Oish, fit and attractive, a few months pregnant, READS to a
     couple of sad PATIENTS in a lounge area.  She trails off as she
     looks up, astonished to see-- 

     SCHUYLER, bruised, frightened, almost looking like he belongs here. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Hello Elizabeth...

     168A(NEW).  I N T .   S P O R T S   C A R  -  D A Y 

     Elizabeth backs out of a parking lot in a 3OO-ZX CONVERTIBLE and
     pulls into traffic, Schuyler beside her, babbling emotionally. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm sorry, I shouldn't be 
                     bothering you-- you're a genuinely
                     good person, your work is 
                     important, it's real, nothing that
                     happens to me is real anymore-- 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     What has happened to you, Sky? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I need your help, you're the only 
                     one left, the only one I can trust--
                     not that I deserve your help, God 
                     how could you have even married me,
                     I was a shit to you-- 

                             ELIZABETH
                     No you weren't-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yes I was.  Sometimes I think I'm
                     being punished for my sins, I
                     mean, there has to be a reason...

                                                       CUT TO:

     169.  I N T .   B R E A K F A S T   P L A C E  -  D A Y 

     ELIZABETH FLIPS THE PAGES of Schuyler's notebook-- page after page 
     of psychotic-looking scribbling, dense UNDERLINES, many EXCLAMATION 
     POINTS.  ON ONE PAGE-- "CRUEL RANDOM SHIT." 

     WIDER-- a few BUSINESS PEOPLE read papers, pick at eggs; A LARGE-
     SCREEN TV plays MORNING PROGRAMS.  Schuyler stares at Elizabeth,
     awaiting reaction... she seems incapable of speech.  He puts the
     tiny radio and earplug on the table between them. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     This is one of their devices, I
                     pulled it off their assassin in
                     the subway.  It's how they 
                     communicate with each other. 

     Elizabeth picks the thing up, studies it, puts the plug to her ear. 

                             ELIZABETH
                     It's... a radio... 

     Schuyler waves dismissively, "you don't understand," takes the
     radio back from her and pockets it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I can't find the right channel...
                     Listen, I may not make it through 
                     this-- if anything happens, get that
                     notebook to, to, the press, or the
                     FBI or something.  Someone you can 
                     trust, I don't know, assuming you can
                     trust anyone.  I just want you to 
                     know I'm not crazy, and I didn't kill
                     myself, no matter what they say-- 

     She stares at him, trying to be strong, but she's very freaked out.
     A BARMAID brings their order.  Schuyler stares at the barmaid
     suspiciously as she puts a cup of coffee before Elizabeth, and
     gives him a bottle of water and a glass.  He tests the seal.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Has this been opened? 

                             BARMAID 
                     No sir.  Just like you said. 

     He watches her as she retreats, leans toward Elizabeth, puts his
     hand on top of her cup. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't think coffee is safe. 

     Schuyler opens the bottle and drinks straight from it thirstily.
     Elizabeth registers the CLINKING HANDCUFFS on his left wrist. 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Schuyler, try and listen to me.  I
                     love you, I always have, I always
                     will.  And maybe this is... good.
                     Maybe this a point you had to
                     reach, before-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                         (staring at her)
                     Before what? 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Before-- I'm just glad you came to
                     me for help.  I don't know if I'm
                     strong enough to, to handle this
                     on my own but I know a lot of
                     excellent crisis people-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Crisis people.  Crisis people?

     A CELL-PHONE RINGS in her purse, she makes an exasperated noise and
     pulls it out, with a "one sec" gesture at Schuyler.  He rises 
     during her conversation, a new look on his face-- he can't trust
     her either. 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Hello?  Hi, hon, I'm OK... um,
                     could I call you back...?

     Schuyler's distracted by something on the TV... he lets out a
     STRANGLED CRY.  Elizabeth turns her head to see. 

     ON TV SCREEN-- It's JIM FEINGOLD, clutching his head, rubbing his
     temples with a look of pain.  CHEESY MUSIC, THROBBING SPFX. 

     SCHUYLER approaches the set, shouting at it. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You bastard!  You fucking bastard!
                     How did you find me here!? 

     Elizabeth gets up, tries to pull him back to the booth, he pushes
     her away, not taking his eyes from the set.  PATRONS react
     nervously to the deranged man. 

                             FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)
                     Ooof-- my head is killing me! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fuck you! 

     THE TV IMAGE WIDENS, a COMMERCIAL ACTRESS rubs Feingold's neck.

                             SCHUYLER
                     Who are you? 

                             ACTRESS (ON TV, filter)
                     Honey, have you taken anything? 

                             FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter) 
                     Sure, some aspirin-- 

     The actress CLUCKS her tongue, shakes her head.

     SCHUYLER's starting to get the picture.

                             SCHUYLER
                     He's an actor... 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Of course he's an actor, it's a commercial. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (a revelation) 
                     He's just a fucking actor... 

     ON TV-- Feingold holds up a colorfully marked bottle of pills,
     studies them with a shit-eating grin.  SOOTHING MUSIC.

                             FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)
                     My head feels great!  Thanks to 
                     Ambutol, I'll never use aspirin again! 

     FEINGOLD gives way to the image of A BOX OF AMBUTOL. 

     SCHUYLER lets Elizabeth escort him back near the booth.  He's
     completely absorbed in his own thoughts. 

                             ELIZABETH
                     Have you taken something? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     What? 

                             ELIZABETH
                     Are you on drugs?

     He shakes his head, waves his hand dismissively.  He's thinking
     about something else.  Elizabeth starts dialing. 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Schuyler, I'm calling a friend 
                     right now, I want you to wait here
                     with me until-- 

     Schuyler tries to sound normal, claps her on the arm.  WHILE HE
     TALKS, CAMERA FINDS Schuyler's other hand, which slips stealthily 
     into her PURSE, lying on the seat of the booth. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Elizabeth, please... I'm sorry, 
                     I'II be alright, it's just been a
                     hard day... Listen, I gotta use
                     the restroom, be right back-- 

     He moves quickly down a corridor marked RESTROOMS and EMERGENCY 
     EXIT.  She looks after him, quite puzzled, phone still to her ear. 

     170.  E X T .   R E S T A U R A N T   P A R K I N G   L O T  -  D A Y 

     Schuyler emerges from a back exit, looking behind him, the 
     EMERGENCY ALARM SOUNDING.  He twirls Elizabeth's car keys on his
     finger as he jogs toward her sports car.  He unlocks it and the
     ALARM SCREAMS for a moment before he figures out how to shut it
     off, then he starts it and PEELS OUT.

     173.  E X T .   C H I N A T O W N  -  D A Y 

     Elizabeth's car zips through traffic in a Chinatown neighborhood 
     full of festive restaurants and shops.

     SCENE 174 DELETED

     175.  E X T .   T U N G   H O Y  -  D A Y 

     Hanging red ducks in the window, a SIGN with a phone number in the 
     window:  "TUNG HOY-- WE DELIVER" in English and Chinese.  SCHUYLER
     argues with an OLD CHINESE WOMAN behind the counter-- 

     175A(NEW).  I N T .   T U N G   H O Y  -  D A Y 

     A cramped, funky restaurant, rows of CELEBRITY HEAD SHOTS on a wall
     behind the delivery counter.  SCHUYLER pursues the CHINESE WOMAN as
     she serves bowls of noodles to a CHINESE FAMILY. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     He's an actor, does TV 
                     commercials, I know he's ordered 
                     from you, he had food delivered to
                     an office building on Mission-- 

                             CHINESE WOMAN 
                     Many customers, very busy, I don't
                     know, I don't know--

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Damn it! 

     Schuyler stalks away from her, finds himself facing the wall of 
     signed photographs--

     ON WALL, old and stained pictures, the most famous being the likes
     of ED McMAHON and CHARO.  Among them is a newer HEAD SHOT of 
     FEINGOLD with a shit-eating grin... below, the name WILLIAM FISHER. 

     SCHUYLER leaps on the counter and tears the photo off the wall-- 

                             CHINESE WOMAN 
                     Stop that, what you doing?! 

     Schuyler's already leapt off the counter, bolts out the door.

     175B(NEW).  I N T .   E L I Z A B E T H ' S   C A R  -  D A Y

     SCHUYLER is on the CARPHONE, glances from the road to-- 

     THE OBVERSE OF THE HEAD SHOT in his hand, a PHONE NUMBER before the 
     (short) list of credits, he flips it to show Feingold/Fisher. 

                             SCHUYLER (on phone) 
                     Yes, Mrs. Fisher, I know it's 
                     short notice but we were hoping 
                     your husband could come in for an
                     audition today, he's perfect...

     SCHUYLER looks annoyed at what he's hearing. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Isn't there any way we can get in
                     touch with him now...?  I see... 

     He makes a quick U-TURN, the tires SCREECHING.

     SCENES 176-179 DELETED

     180.  E X T .   Z O O  -  D A Y 

     Late afternoon.  PAN FROM THE ENTRANCE to find SCHUYLER buying a 
     ticket and hurrying in. 

     181. IN THE ZOO, Schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy. 

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- ZOO-GOERS gazing at the ANIMALS... CAMERA FINDS 
     Feingold/Fisher, wearing casual clothes, eating a popsicle.  He's
     doing his best to supervise THREE OBNOXIOUS CHILDREN, two boys and
     an older girl.  He's just another dad at the zoo, far from 
     impressive-- the Wizard of Oz after the curtain's been pulled. 

     When he makes eye contact with Schuyler, he pales, trying to herd
     the children together as Schuyler moves in on him... he can't get 
     away.  Schuyler grabs the man's shirt. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Bill Fisher, hi!  I really admire
                     your work... 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Oh please... I got my kids here... 

     Schuyler releases him, Feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes.
     Schuyler casually shows him the gun, the man's eyes widen. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Get rid of them. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                          (to the kids) 
                     Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty!
                     Snack time!

     He dangles the bill over their heads, the KIDS CHEER, leap like
     dolphins after fish.  The girl's tallest, grabs the cash, they run
     for a nearby concession.  Schuyler and Feingold stroll together. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Look, buddy, it was just a job-- 
                     nothing personal, y'know?  I play
                     my part, improvise a little, 
                     that's what I'm good at, I still
                     do a little stand-up-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I've seen your resume.  I'm sick
                     of foot soldiers, I've gotta get
                     to whoever's in charge. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Of CRS?  Christ, nobody knows, nobody
                     gets the big picture--
                          (looking away) 
                     Jason, Tommy, cut it out! 

     FEINGOLD'S BOYS ARE THROWING ROCKS at the monkeys.  They give their
     father a look and saunter along. 

     SCHUYLER's not interested in the zoo drama. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Goddammit, why do they do that. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     How do I find them!?  Their
                     offices were abandoned-- 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     They own the whole building, they
                     just move from floor to floor. 

     Schuyler takes this in for a moment, thinking. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     OK... They know you, you've worked for
                     them.  You're going to get me inside. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                        (shaking his head) 
                     Uh-uh, I'm sorry and all, but-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Tell them anything, tell them the cops
                     are after you, you've gotta talk to
                     someone or you'll blow the whistle. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     No way, it's too dangerous.

     Schuyler cocks his head, steps in front of him.  Right in his face:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You don't seem to understand.  Right
                     here, right now-- I'm the danger. 

     Feingold gets the message. 

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     182.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  N I G H T 

     LIGHTS OFF in the building.  A battered STATION WAGON rounds a
     corner, PAUSES before the ramp to the garage entrance-- the same
     garage he and Christine were once tormented in. 

     183.  I N T .   S T A T I O N   W A G O N  -  N I G H T 

     FEINGOLD drives, looking very tense; a kiddie seat strapped next to
     him, junk galore; he's apparently alone. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     We're here, Sky.  They said they're on
                     the twelfth floor. 

     BEHIND THE SEAT-- Schuyler crouches under a blanket. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Drive in, then. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Look-- what are you gonna do?  Really? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Really-- I don't know.  Improvise.  Go! 

     183A.  I N T .   C R S   G A R A G E  -  N I G H T 

     The station wagon stops at the bottom of the ramp.  A BEEFY GATE
     GUARD behind glass glares at Feingold, who waves timidly.  The
     STEEL GATE RISES and the station wagon drives in. 

     THE STATION WAGON parks near an elevator bank; a handful of CARS, a
     few white CRS SECURITY VEHICLES and VANS parked nearby.  Feingold
     climbs out, trying hard not to look scared.  ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN 
     and a beefy, frightening-looking SECURITY MAN in a suit steps out.
     He looks around carefully as Feingold joins him.  He takes
     Feingold's arm and pulls him toward the elevator.  They wait.

     SCHUYLER'S POV from the back seat-- just as the DOORS OPEN, the
     Gate Guard steps up behind Feingold, puts a gun in his back. 

                             GATE GUARD 
                     You're not authorized to be here. 

     HE FIRES-- Schuyler glimpses a SPRAY OF BLOOD, Feingold collapses.
     The Security Man grabs the body as it falls, starts dragging it out
     of sight while the Gate Guard puts a hand to his ear, talks into a
     mini-transmitter in his other hand.  He follows the Security Man
     out of sight.  The elevator doors remain open. 

     With the guards out of sight, Schuyler rises slowly.  He looks
     stunned and sickened as he lets himself out cautiously, sneaking 
     behind vehicles.  The main gate is sealed, he has no idea how long
     the guards will be gone.  THE OPEN ELEVATOR DOORS beckon. 

     Schuyler crawls on his belly the last few yards, starts, finding--

     CLOSE, a RUBBER BUG on its back. 

     SCHUYLER creeps military style, on hands and knees, the rest of the 
     way to the elevator.  He puts a hand in some of Feingold's BLOOD,
     winces, then gets in the elevator. 

     184.  I N T .   C R S   E L E V A T O R  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER presses the button for 12-- the top floor. 

     ON PANEL-- nothing happens, the button LIGHTS for an instant but 
     GOES OUT again.  The elevator won't move.

     SCHUYLER's getting exasperated. 

     ON PANEL-- he tries BUTTONS allover, same story. 

                             GATE GUARD
                     Yo! 

     ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the gate guard jogs TOWARD the elevators,
     pulling his gun. 

     SCHUYLER starts to panic, pulls his own gun and POINTS IT AT THE
     GUARD, who freezes and raises his hands.  Behind him, the Security
     Man approaches Schuyler from a different angle, his gun out. 

     Schuyler can't get a bead on both of them. 

                             SECURITY MAN
                     You're a dead man. 

     Schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel-- 

     AT BASE OF PANEL, a gold keyhole.  CLOSER-- the letters CRS are
     printed beneath it, very small. 

     SCHUYLER shakes his head-- it couldn't be; but what else can he do?

     ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the guards are fanning out and getting closer. 

     SCHUYLER reaches with one hand for his keys, fumbling for the small 
     gold key he received at the start of the game. 

     ON PANEL-- his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key... it
     fits into the hole; he turns it and PUSHES THE BUTTON for 12. 

     WIDER-- as the DOORS CLOSE, both guards train their guns-- but too
     late.  Schuyler's on his way up. 

     184A. THE GLASS ELEVATOR RISES through completely blackened spaces. 

     SCHUYLER stares at a BULLET HOLE in the back of the glass elevator,
     a remnant of Feingold's murder.  He holds the gun in front of 
     himself in both hands... then he closes his eyes, steeling himself,
     almost in an attitude of prayer. 

     185.  I N T .   A T R I U M  -  N I G H T 

     PITCH BLACK but for the LIT ELEVATOR ascending swiftly through the
     darkness... Schuyler, like a solitary spaceship pilot, looks upward
     toward his unknown destination. 

     186.  I N T .   C R S   E L E V A T O R  -  N I G H T 

     The DIGITAL READOUT slows as it comes to 10, 11 and STOPS at 12. 

     SCHUYLER comes out of his trance, slips the revolver back into his 
     jacket pocket, keeps a hand there, and stands against a wall of the
     elevator as the DOORS OPEN ON-- 

     187.  I N T .   1 2 T H   F L O O R   C O M M I S S A R Y  -  N I G H T 

     --A BUSTLING, NOISY COMMISSARY.  Schuyler keeps the gun concealed
     as he steps out of the elevator-- nobody here is paying any 
     attention to him anyway.  There's a cafeteria style counter along
     one wall, people CHATTING and LAUGHING at Formica tables... amongst
     others, everyone from his game appears to be here... there's the 
     RASTA, the PARAMEDICS with the HEART ATTACK VICTIM, JOHN and PETE
     from the men's club, the GIRL from the boat, the DESK CLERK and 
     BELLHOP... also the HONDURAN TRUCK DRIVER, the SECURITY PEOPLE from
     his house, the PUNK and the TRANSIT COP... and a lot of ENGINEERS. 

     SCHUYLER inches into the room, meets the eyes of-- 

     CHRISTINE, who's just come away from the cafeteria counter with a
     tray of food.  She nearly drops it, looks over her shoulder to see
     if anyone is watching.  Suddenly, Schuyler is in front of her, 
     backs her into an alcove-- she holds the tray between them as if to
     protect herself.

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What are you doing here? 

     For a moment, Schuyler's not sure.  His voice is flat, monotonal:

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I'm back from the dead. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Listen, everything's OK, nobody 
                     touched your money, nobody stole a
                     thing, that's impossible-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I don't give a fuck about the money,
                     I wanna know who's behind this, who 
                     did this to me, how, why-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     It's just a game! 

     Even though she's keeping a surface cool, he notices the GLASS and
     SILVERWARE on her tray RATTLING.  She starts to move toward a
     table, he blocks her path. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're not going anywhere. 
                     Feingold, or or Fisher, was that
                     just a game too? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     What are you talking about?

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I watched him die...

     Schuyler shows her his BLOOD-STAINED HAND.  Christine looks utterly
     perplexed, then shrugs, finding a place to put down her tray. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Seemed like a nice guy, actually,
                     father of three-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Well, look, I'm sure it's just
                     another stunt-- that can't be 
                     real, taste it.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You taste it, you fucking vampire. 

     He pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then
     puts a finger to her ear as-- 

     THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and the guard and security man from
     downstairs burst into the commissary. 

     Suddenly the ROOM QUIETS, many others are touching their ears. 

     They all TURN in the direction of Schuyler and Christine.  The gate
     guard gestures at Schuyler, attempting a smile. 

                             GATE GUARD 
                     Could you come with us, please? 
                     You're not authorized to be here. 

     Schuyler grabs Christine, wraps an arm around her throat, puts his
     GUN to her neck. 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Back off.  Everybody back off. 

     He uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally
     toward the nearest door, she CHOKES and GASPS.

     188.  I N T .   S T A I R W E L L  -  N I G H T 

     The door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead UP.

                             SCHUYLER
                     Shit, how do we get out-- 

     Christine STOMPS his foot and ELBOWS his gut, breaks free and bolts
     up the stairs.  Schuyler catches his breath and pursues.  Beneath
     him, the stairwell door opens, GUARDS PURSUE. 

     189.  E X T .   C R S   R O O F  -  N I G H T 

     A HIGH LEDGE surrounds the roof on all four sides, a ROOF ENTRANCE
     at each side as well.  The NUMBER "636" is painted large for
     helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc.  A
     MUFFLED ALARM sounds as Christine bursts through the door, followed
     by Schuyler.  She spins, her back to the EDGE of the atrium, a 
     black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken GLASS SKYLIGHT, a
     white RAILING around it. 

     Schuyler SLAMS the door, a large number 1 painted on it in BLUE.
     He throws the HEAVY BOLT.  He and Christine circle each other 
     warily, his gun trained on her.  POUNDING from the other side,
     MUFFLED VOICES that can't be heard. 

     For the first time, Christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then
     clutches the railing. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Wait a minute.  What's that? 

     Schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child: 

                             SCHUYLER
                     It's my gun...

                             CHRISTINE 
                     We didn't give it to you?  Where did
                     it come from? 

                             SCHUYLER
                     A gun store. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     We searched your house! 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Guess you fucked up again. 

     Christine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her
     hand to her mouth, speaks urgently. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     He's armed, he's got a real gun. 
                     Real Situation, real-- 

     Schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the EAR PIECE and
     HAND MIKE away from Christine, the wire tears her blouse open. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yeah, it's real all right. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Schuyler this is all fake, tricks,
                     it's all part of the game--

                             SCHUYLER
                     Stop it.  Every word out of your
                     mouth is a lie-- 

     Christine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     The key!!  They, we gave you a key
                     to the elevator!  Why would we do 
                     that?!  We wanted you to come up-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Of course you did.  So you could kill 
                     me or, or frame me for murder--

                             CHRISTINE
                     No, no, it's THE GAME!!  Blanks, 
                     squibs, high-tech special effects,
                     none of it's real!  Just open that
                     door and I'll show you! 

     Schuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I open the door and I die. 

     ON THE DOOR-- POUNDING DESPERATE, but the ALARM DROWNS out the
     sounds of VOICES on the other side. 

     SCHUYLER turns quickly as she takes a step towards him.  He points
     the gun at her again.  He looks ready to use it.  The following
     DIALOG overlaps and collides, growing AURAL CHAOS-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You move again I swear I'll kill
                     you, you bitch. 

                             CHRISTINE
                     THINK ABOUT IT!!  They followed you
                     every step of the way, the cab, in 
                     the trunk, we had a diver--

                             SCHUYLER
                     They?  We?

                             CHRISTINE
                     --the guy in Honduras, the cop on
                     the train, there was always a
                     safety net, always-- 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Shut up, shut the fuck up!! 

     AXES DENT the metal door, which BULGES. 

     He looks at the monitor in his hand, the one he tore from her body,
     putting it in his own ear, letting the rest of the device dangle. 

                             RADIO VOICE (filter)
                     --just hang in there, keep talking
                     him down, we're on our way-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     We've been trying to end it since
                     you got back, our people came to
                     your house, they tried to bring 
                     you in from the subway, you kept
                     running, you weren't supposed to
                     keep getting lost-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You just said you wanted me to 
                     come here-- you're making this up
                     as you go along! 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Please Sky, please.  Take a breath
                     and think about it! 

                             SCHUYLER
                     Stop.  Fucking.  With my head! 

     Schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead, the gun TREMBLING
     in his hand.  Christine's regaining control.  Schuyler's mind
     whirls, he GROANS, almost crying as he considers for the first time
     that she might be telling the truth.  She steps closer.

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You're all right, it's OK, just relax... 

                             RADIO VOICE (filter) 
                     Are you there?  How's he doing?

                             CHRISTINE
                     Please... when you open the door, the 
                     game ends... just open the door... Bill
                     Fisher's out there, he's fine, nobody
                     got hurt.  Why would we do the crazy 
                     things we did, if it wasn't part of a
                     game?  We thought you knew that... 

     He looks at her, almost ready to lower the gun.  He raises his
     bloody hand to his lips, about to taste it. 

                             RADIO VOICE (filter) 
                     --we're at the North entrance, 
                     Number 2, just a few more seconds
                     and we'll nail him-- 

     Schuyler's eyes dart toward--

     ANOTHER DOORWAY, on the other side of the atrium, like the one
     that's bolted.  The number 2 is painted on it in RED.  The handle
     starts to TURN just as-- 

     --CHRISTINE LUNGES AT HIM to wrest the gun away. 

     SCHUYLER comes to his senses, struggling.  The GUN GOES OFF, the
     report should be DEAFENING. 

     He spins, points the gun at Door #2 and FIRES again, several times.
     THE ALARM STOPS-- SILENCE. 

     Christine STIFFENS, falls backwards onto the ground, clutching her
     BLOOD-DRENCHED stomach.  Schuyler just stares.  Dark blood SPILLS 
     from her mouth as she CHOKES in pain...

                             CHRISTINE
                     Oh God.  I blew it... we blew it...

     DOOR #2 OPENS and-- 

     DAVID steps through.  He wears a brightly colored, silly looking
     PARTY HAT, carries a magnum of CHAMPAGNE bearing a huge BOW that
     reads, "SURPRISE."  BLOOD PUMPS from HIS CHEST.  He DROPS THE
     BOTTLE, which SHATTERS... David collapses amidst the broken glass. 

     A BLOW OF THE AXE SEVERS the deadbolt and Door #1 flies open behind
     Schuyler.  FEINGOLD is the first of a group to come charging 
     through, he wears a TUXEDO with a ROSE in the lapel, holds the axe.

     SCHUYLER spins, points the gun at this axe-wielding man, then,
     utterly stunned, lowers it in disbelief. 

     FEINGOLD looks from Schuyler to the wounded Christine-- her agony
     is painful to watch.  He drops the axe with a CLATTER and runs to
     her side, kneels.  His voice CRACKS. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     You shot her!?  No!
                       (looking toward David) 
                     Qh God no... 

     THE GUARD and SECURITY MAN come out on the roof looking very
     disturbed, followed by the RASTA and a few OTHERS.  Many are
     dressed for a party now.  Feingold looks to their horrified faces. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     He fucking shot them!! 

                             RASTA 
                     I'll call an ambulance. 

     The Rasta dashes downstairs.  Schuyler backs away, drops the gun,
     staggers over to David.  He's GASPING for breath.  CRS EMPLOYEES 
     give the brothers a wide berth, move toward Feingold and Christine.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     David, David, no, no-- 

                             DAVID 
                     Oh God, Oh God, Sky, save me, I 
                     don't wanna die, I don't wanna-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     You're not gonna die.  I'm here,
                     you're not gonna die... 

     David's already DEAD, eyes wide, body limp. 

     WITH FEINGOLD and CHRISTINE.  He holds his colorful cummerbund over 
     her stomach to staunch the bleeding.  She CHOKES in pain.

                             FEINGOLD
                     Hang on, just hang on, you're
                     gonna make it-- 

                             CHRISTINE
                     That stupid... 

     They stare over at Schuyler, registering David's death.  Schuyler
     is now drenched in his brother's blood, rocking him in his arms.
     Most of the assorted CRS people move to get out of the building
     before the cops show, MURMURING amongst themselves in fear. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Oh God.  I thought you could 
                     handle it.  All the tests... they
                     said you could handle it...

     CHRISTINE yells at Schuyler, unable to stand-- 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     You fucking psycho, you piece of 
                     shit, how could you-- 

     SCHUYLER gently lowers his brother and rises, like a zombie now.
     The big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it,
     keeping it out of his reach. 

     Schuyler backs away from the body, starts to SHAKE, looks as if he
     really has lost his mind.  Feingold SOBS aloud.

                             FEINGOLD 
                     God, why-- there was no point.  It was
                     supposed to be fun...

     Schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded Christine-- who
     GASPS silent curses, beyond speech-- to David's body...

     He slowly turns to the Atrium pit directly in front of him.  He's
     strangely calm...

                             SCHUYLER
                     Fun... 

     SHIFT TO SLOW MOTION: 

     SCHUYLER moves for the edge of the atrium pit...

     THE OTHERS react in HORROR, SHOUT "NO!!", lunging TOWARD HIM...

     DAVID'S HEAD suddenly MOVES, he BLINKS...

     SCHUYLER leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit.

     CHRISTINE jumps to her feet, perfectly alert, a hand extended,
     SCREAMING, just as-- 

     SCHUYLER CATAPULTS HIMSELF INTO SPACE, and--

     DAVID SITS BOLT UPRIGHT. 

                             DAVID 
                     SKY, NOOOO!!

     SCHUYLER sees this, too late-- 

     HE AND DAVID make terrified, helpless eye contact across the void, 
     arms outstretched.  Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable
     error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an
     agonizing MOMENT. 

     THEN HE FALLS...  LEAVE SLOW MOTION.

     190.  I N T .   A T R I U M  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER CRASHES through the skylight, TUMBLING-- SPARKLING SHARDS 
     surround him like stars as he PLUNGES, SPINS, SCREAMING. 

     191. RAPID CUTS-- the CLOWN, CHRISTINE's face, SCHUYLER and DAVID
     as CHILDREN, HIS FATHER's head striking the landing.  These FLASH
     PAST so rapidly we can't quite process them. 

     192. INTERCUT WITH:  INCREASING DARKNESS, GROUND RUSHING CLOSER... 

     ON SCHUYLER'S FACE as he experiences the epiphany that comes before
     the end.  BRILLIANT ANGELIC LIGHT suddenly illuminates him, his
     eyes roll into his head, closing-- 

     ANGLE FROM ABOVE-- the LIGHTS are real, they've COME ON to show-- 

     SCHUYLER'S IMPACT-- he LANDS on his back, arms outstretched, eyes
     squeezed shut-- 

     --and is swallowed by an ENORMOUS INFLATED LIFESAVING CUSHION that
     covers the floor of the atrium. 

     SCHUYLER BOUNCES in the cushion a few times, gradually coming to a
     rest, harmless bits of BREAKAWAY GLASS showering down around him. 

     He doesn't move a muscle, his eyes still closed. 

     CLOSER ON HIS FACE... muscles twitch.  His eyes open. 

     HIS POV-- UP the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the 
     building around the atrium.  THE FULL MOON in the very center
     through the hole in the glass. 

     All the lighted GLASS ELEVATORS COME TO EARTH, packed with people.

     SCHUYLER stares upward, mouth open, motionless. 

     DAVID comes running from an elevator, leaps up onto the cushion and
     bounces over to Schuyler, a huge smile on his face. 

                             DAVID 
                     Hey, bro, how you doin'? 

     Getting no response, David hops closer, squats by Schuyler's side. 

                             DAVID 
                     Admit it, you weren't bored...

     SCHUYLER remains motionless, David's worried now, grabs his arm and
     starts shaking him.

                             DAVID 
                     Jesus.  Sky, c'mon Sky-- 

     SCHUYLER begins to LAUGH, a tremendous catharsis.  DAVID laughs
     too, greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet. 

     THE TWO BROTHERS clutch each other for support on the BOUNCING 
     surface, LAUGHING.  CRS EMPLOYEES have gathered around the cushion,
     CHEERING and APPLAUDING. 

     SCHUYLER wipes his eyes, shaking his head with amazement.  Then he
     hauls back and SLUGS DAVID in the jaw, sending him flying onto his 
     back on the cushion.  MORE CHEERS from the crowd, as if they were
     watching a boxing match. 

                                                       CUT TO:

     193.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  N I G H T 

     THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS from Handel's "Messiah" plays.  SCHUYLER and 
     DAVID enter together from the atrium, the CUSHION deflates behind
     them.  David licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw. 

                             DAVID 
                     You've been wanting to do that for
                     a long, long time, haven't you? 

     Schuyler half-smiles.  The SECURITY MAN unlocks Schuyler's 
     handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which Schuyler stares at. 

                             DAVID 
                     Like they'd really leave a loaded gun
                     lying around.  They went over the 
                     whole place with a metal detector, 
                     then packed that thing with blanks. 

     They turn a corner into the main lobby, Schuyler absently pockets
     the gun, looks up in wonder...

     SCHUYLER'S POV-- a SURPRISE PARTY:  A STEREO, STREAMERS and
     BALLOONS, a CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN, CAKE and FOOD.  CRS EMPLOYEES
     (mostly ordinary-looking office workers) CLAP and CHEER for
     Schuyler.  They wear PARTY HATS, blow PLASTIC HORNS. 

     SMILING PEOPLE eager to offer CONGRATULATIONS surround him.  He's
     pretty shaky, like a newborn calf.  JOHN and PETE shake his hand.

                             JOHN 
                     Good one, buddy, really had you
                     going, didn't we? 

                             PETE 
                     Wait'll you try level two...
                             (a wink)
                     Joke. 

     The RASTA SLAPS his back, Schuyler instinctively looks over his
     shoulder for a gag message.

                             RASTA 
                     That look on your face up there?
                     Shit, man, I almost lost it. 

     The RECEPTIONIST POPS a bottle of Dom Perignon, hands it to Sky. 

                             RECEPTIONIST 
                     Awesome game-- best I've seen. 

     Not knowing what else to do, Schuyler takes a slug.  The GIRL from
     the boat KISSES his cheek.  TECHNICIANS, men with STUNTS UNLIMITED
     T-SHIRTS, the NURSE from the asylum, the SECURITY PEOPLE, CRS
     GUARDS, AGENTS, all want a piece of him at once. 

     The "MESSIAH" FADES and an R & B BAND breaks into ROUSING MUSIC as
     Feingold approaches and sticks a CIGAR in his mouth, LIGHTS it. 

                             FEINGOLD 
                     Sure glad you jumped, compadre. 
                     Otherwise I was supposed to throw
                     you off. 
                           (whispering) 
                     It's not strictly legal, so don't 
                     tell anyone... 
                        (a beat, off Schuyler's look)
                     The cigar.  It's a Monte Cristo,
                     straight from Havana. 

     Christine approaches, wobbly and dazed herself; she touches his
     arm.  Her voice is soft for the first time, accents gone. 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Hey... you all right? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                          (nods slowly)
                     I think so.  You? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Little shook.  I'm pretty much a
                     method actress, y'know? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What's your name? 

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Susan.  Susan Waters. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Nice to meet you, Susan...

                             CHRISTINE 
                     Can I have a puff? 

     He gives her a DRAG on his cigar.

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Look, I have to know.  Who's
                     really in charge? 

     She shrugs, blows a SMOKE RING and sticks her finger through it.

                             CHRISTINE
                     God?

     She winks and strolls off.  Schuyler smiles, looking after her. 

     DANCING is starting up IN BG.  A clutch of non-CRS people approach
     tentatively-- including PLYMPTON, ELIZABETH, MARIA and JACK.  They
     all look very confused. 

                             PLYMPTON 
                     What is this, Sky?  We got a call
                     from your brother, said there was
                     a surprise party...

                             ELIZABETH 
                     Kind of late for your birthday,
                     isn't it? 

     Schuyler LAUGHS, gives her a hug, surprising her.  He still has a
     giddy smile plastered on his face. 

                             ELIZABETH 
                     If you wanted to borrow my car,
                     you could've just asked-- 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     I know, Liz, I've been an idiot,
                     and I'm sorry...

                             PLYMPTON
                     You OK? 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     Yeah-- I'm good, really.  Happy to 
                     be alive... Listen, it's great to 
                     see all of you, thanks for coming--
                     but there's something I have to do.
                     Excuse me. 

     He moves away quickly.

     SCENES 194-197 DELETED 

     198(NEW).  I N T .   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T 

     SCHUYLER FLUSHES and moves away from a urinal.  David waits a few
     feet away by the sinks and mirrors; Schuyler starts slightly. 

                             DAVID 
                     So what's the object of the game? 

                             SCHUYLER
                             (a beat)
                     What game? 

                             DAVID
                     Very good... 

                             SCHUYLER 
                       (rinsing his hands) 
                     Is it always like this? 

                             DAVID 
                     Mine was a little weirder.  Tell
                     you about it sometime. 

     David pulls out A COLORED ENVELOPE, slips it into Schuyler's shirt.
     Schuyler looks at him curiously as he dries his hands. 

                             DAVID 
                     The bill.  It's itemized.  Don't
                     bother opening it now...

                             SCHUYLER 
                           (opening it) 
                     I thought it was a gift. 

                             DAVID 
                     Well, no, the card was the gift,
                     the rest was up to you. 

     CAMERA FOLLOWS as David hurries out of the rest room, Schuyler
     behind him, flipping pages of a long, long bill--

     199(NEW).  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  N I G H T 

     --we rejoin the PARTY, which is now in full swing.  Schuyler stands
     alone at the periphery of the dance floor with the bill.  He hits
     the bottom line... he blinks and GASPS. 

     CHRISTINE appears, taking his hand and pulling him away. 

                             SCHUYLER 
                     What?  Where are we going? 

                             CHRISTINE
                     Does it matter? 

     They move into a stairwell and start climbing O. S., their hands
     all over each other.  We hear the MUSIC and FESTIVITIES continuing
     in BG. 

     CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on a SIGN painted on the wall with an arrow
     upward:  "LEVEL 2..."

          1 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 1

          From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell
          fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns.
          Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window,
          lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes.
          He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if
          he might run back into the flames. But the heat is
          unbearable. He runs toward us then past us through black
          shadows. We cannot see his face,

          1A EXT. WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (WINTER 1930S) 1A

           Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun.
           A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes!

          2 EXT. YARD - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 2

           The rock thrower, TOM ( 10) is hightailing it away from an
          isolated Appalachian SHACK as the door bangs open, a shotgun
          barrel appears, and a chicken comes SQUAWKING out from under
          the porch!
          Thinking he's sure to be shot, Tom runs into the old barn!

          3 INT. BUSH'S BARN - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 3

          Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light,
          trying to see through the cracks. There is a loud SNORT and
          the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his
          shoulder.
          Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the
          barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him!
          Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up!
          When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a
          fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a
          handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then
          takes it and wipes his mouth.
          Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the
          boy will never forget before waving him away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          4 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 4

          Looking back over his shoulder, Tom runs for the road. Two of
          his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust.
          BUSH (72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with
          a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper.

          5 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 5

          Bush enters the barn to check on his companion. MULE is older
          than Bush in mule years and just as gray. He wears an old
          mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets
          nervously from all the excitement. Bush comforts him.

                         BUS H
          Just a boy, that's all.

                         6 SERIES: 6
          7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7
          fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'. Bush checks
          the road in both directions. All clear for now.
          8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8
          dozes in the shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn
          into his road, right past his new sign. He glances at his
          shotgun leaning against the shack.
          The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees
          Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation.

                         HORTON
          Mornin', sir.

                         BUSH
          Hard life if you can't read..

                         HORTON
          Pardon? I'm uh, Reverend Gus
          Horton, sir, how you doing?
          Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton.

                         BUSH
          Don't need saving, preacher.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         HORTON
          Uh, well, Mr. Wiley Starke has
          passed on, sir. His funeral is
          tomorrow and I thought you might
          want to know since..

                         BUSH

                         (SOFTLY)
          What got him?

                         HORTON
          Just got old, sir.

                         BUSH
          Yeah, well..
          Bush returns to chopping wood.
          Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops.

                         HORTON
          Mr. Starke told me that you and him
          ran away from home when you were 6
          years old. Is that true?

                         BUSH
          I talked him into it.
          Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping.

                         HORTON
          Well.. anyway.. I.. alright..
          Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves.
           Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying.

          9 EXT. CEMETERY - EVENING 9

          The loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by Wiley
          Starke's fresh grave. The mounded earth is covered with
          beautiful flowers and wreathes, a loving send off from his
          family and friends. As we pan past the flowers and cards..
          we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty.
          Hunkered down nearby, Bush is as still as a gravestone,
          staring at the last resting place of his old friend.
          As Bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands frozen,
          staring at a pot of YELLOW FLOWERS on a distant grave. Now he
          turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          10 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 10

          Rain drums hard on the tin roof as Bush, soaked to the bone
          and shaking with chills, rummages through an old hat box by
          lamp light: Letters, news clippings and keepsakes. He finds
          what he's looking for: A PICTURE of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.
          She smiles at us from happier days. Realizing that he is
          raging with a serious fever, he tries to stand up only to
          collapse back on the bed.

                         11 OMIT 11/12/13 11

          14 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 14

          Wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp, Bush moves
          slowly toward the barn. But he is so wracked with fever he
          has to stop. It stuns him that he can't go on. He never
          thought anything could stop him. Stuck in the rain with the
          shaking lamp sizzling, he stares into the forever darkness,
          the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light.

                         BUSH
          Well hell..

          15 INT. BUSH'S BARN - NIGHT 15

          Somehow he has made it. Sopping wet and shivering, Bush is in
          bad shape and knows it.
          Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises.
          Bush blindly pours Mule some feed and the poor old thing
          snatches his first meal in days.
          Bush tries to think through the fever. He stumbles back to
          the door and swings it wide open so Mule can get out if Bush
          doesn't make it. Satisfied, he comes back and drops hard onto
          a pile of hay near Mule.

                         BUSH
          Always thought you'd go first..
          White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running
          out of oil, the light fading fast to darkness. Thoughts
          tumble through his mind, troubling him, stirring the dark
          waters of memory.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

          16 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 16

          PAN across the stillness of the foothills to the barn. The
          door is still swung wide open.
          Back from the brink of death, Bush emerges into the blinding
          sunlight. Mule is dozing in his favorite spot. He swings his
          big gray head over at Bush.

                         BUSH
          Ahh, don't look so disappointed.

                         17 OMITTED 17

          18 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 18 

          Mule watches Bush heave a creaky old wagon out from behind
          the barn. Mule climbs up on all fours. Bush gets a set of
          reins and walks toward him. Mule starts to take a stroll,
          knowing what the reins mean.

                         BUSH
          You better not.
          Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops.

                         BUSH
          And coffee when we get there.

          19 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 19

          Old wheels creak and moan. Bush and Mule ease up Main street
          with the cart. PEOPLE try to catch a glimpse of the infamous
          recluse.
          Mule comes to a wearied stop, breathing hard. Bush climbs off
          the cart and walks Mule, ignoring the eyes upon him.

          20 INT. CHAPEL - DAY 20

          Reverend Horton, stoking the wood stove, hears FOOTSTEPS.

                         HORTON
          Buddy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          But as he turns he sees Bush silently looking around.

                         HORTON
          Oh! Hello..
          Horton comes to Bush but Bush ignores him and keeps
          critically looking around.

                         HORTON
          What can I do for you, sir?
          Suddenly BUDDY and KATHRYN ROBINSON (20's) enter from the
          vestibule with their new BABY. In their own world, and not
          realizing that there is anyone in the chapel, Kathryn picks
          some lint from Buddy's jacket. He catches her fingers and
          kisses them.
          Bush is transfixed by the loving moment.

                         BUSH
          I can wait.
          Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush. Buddy nods
          to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into the vestibule to
          give Bush and Horton privacy.

                         HORTON
          It's alright, have a seat.
          Bush sits down uneasily in a pew. Horton sits down in the pew
          in front of him and twists around to face him. The wintry
          light from the near window washes over them.

                         HORTON
          What's on your mind, sir?

                         BUSH
          Bout time for me to get low.

                         HORTON
          Get what?

                         BUSH
          Down to business
          Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of
          MONEY on the pew. Horton's eyes bulge.

                         BUSH
          Need a funeral.
          Horton looks up from the money.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         HORTON
          For who?

                         BUSH
          Me.
          Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as
          hell, until Kathryn pulls him back.

                          HORTON
           For you?
          (off Bush's impatient nod)
          You want to buy a funeral for you?

                         BUSH
          Am I not talking right?

                         HORTON
          No, yes, I'm sorry. Are you sick
          sir?

                         BUSH
          Everybody dies.

                         HORTON
          True, but..

                         BUSH
          I don't take care of my bones it
          won't get done, will it?

                         HORTON
          All right, I see. Well the church
          can help you get your affairs in
          order, arrange a service..
          Horton glances at the strange wad of money again.

                         BUSH
          What would you say?

                         HORTON
          About what?

                         BUS H
          Me.

                         HORTON
          A eulogy? I.. don't know. What do
          you want me to say?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         BUSH
          Say what you'd say right now to my
          face.

                         HORTON
          Well. I uh, I don't know much about
          you, Mr. Bush. I mean, I've heard
          stories but..

                         BUSH
          What stories?
          Bush leans in and stares into Horton. It feels like
          everything in the world stops dead.
          Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too.

                         HORTON
          Just stories..
          (off Bush's intense look)
          .you know, people talking.

                         BUSH
          What kind of stories? Say one.

                         HORTON
          Sir.. my mother used to say that
          gossip is the devil's radio..

                         (UNFORTUNATE ASIDE)
          .not that she didn't play that
          radio at full volume now and then,
          bless her heart, but..
          (back to business)
          .what matters when you come to the
          end of your life is that you're
          ready for the next one. Have you
          made peace with God, sir?

                         BUS H
          I paid.
          Horton has no idea what Bush means. He looks at the money,
          back at Bush.

                         HORTON
          Well.. you can't buy forgiveness,
          Mr. Bush. It's free. But you do
          have to ask for it.

                         BUSH
          Nothing in this world is free,
          preacher.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Bush abruptly grabs his money and starts out. His hand bangs
          into the pew and the money FALLS.
          Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops
          back into the vestibule.
          Bush storms past Buddy, Kathryn and the baby like a hot wind.

          20A EXT. CHURCH - DAY 20A

          Bush heads off down the road on his wagon. Horton, Buddy, and
          Kathryn appear at the door and watch him go.

                         HORTON
          That was, uh, different.

                         KATHRYN
          I heard such awful things about him
          when I was a kid.

                         HORTON
          My mother probably told you some of
          them.
          Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing
          at the baby. Buddy lingers, staring at Bush, thinking..

          21 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 21

          Bush's wagon loaded with bags of feed and supplies, sits in
          front of the Diner.
          Bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for Mule who is
          drinking it and loving it.
          Tom (the kid who threw the rock) comes from behind the diner
          with a full garbage can to empty into the big trash barrels
          on the back of an old pick-up truck. He sees Bush and
          freezes.
          Bush looks up and stares at him.
          The diner door snaps open and BONNIE (30's), Tom's mother,
          steps out. She sees Tom and Bush staring at each other.

                         BONNIE
          What are you doing, son?
          Now Tom is scared to death that Bush is going to tell on him.
          Bonnie doesn't like this staring match at all.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         BONNIE
          Empty those cans in your daddy's
          truck and get back in here. Now.
          Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the hook.
          Relieved, Tom heaves the can up into the truck. Bonnie
          hesitates then goes back into the diner just as...
          .CARL (30s), his sidekick, GARY, and two other MEN come
          across the street toward the diner. Gary sees Mule slurping
          coffee from the big tin cup.

                         GARY
          Look at that. A mule drinking
          coffee!

                         CARL
          Finally found somebody that likes
          Bonnie's coffee.
          As they move past, they see Bush standing there..

                         WORKER
          Ya'll better hush, that's old Bush.
          Carl eyes him. Gary and the others throw curious glances as
          they head into the diner. Carl stops.

                         CARL
          Hey..

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          I'm talking to you..
          Carl picks up a handful of gravel, tosses some over
          nonchalantly in Bush's direction. Bush ignores it.

                         CARL
          We know about you. You stay out of
          this diner. There's women and
          children here and we don't want you
          around them.
          Bush stands to mount up, never turning around.

                         CARL
          You better hear me. I see you here
          again, I'll.. Hey! Hey!
          Hearing the hollering, Tom looks up from the pick-up.
          Carl throws a stone, harder this time to get Bush's
          attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          But the rock misses Bush and hits Mule, startling him. Old
          instincts kick in and he has a VIOLENT FIT.

                         CARL
          Shit..
          Carl moves up to try and calm him..
          .as Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a
          GASH in Mule's hind-quarter. Mule whinnies painfully, slowly
          surrendering.
          As Carl steps up, Bush yanks the BRAKE HANDLE off the cart
          and hits Carl in the chest. Air explodes from Carl as he
          gasps with pain. Before he can move, Bush hits him again in
          the same place. Carl wants to hit back but he has no air.
          Lightning quick, Bush steps back and hits Carl again in the
          exact same place.
          Carl falls like a bag of bones. He looks up and sees Bush
          towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in him.
          It has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to
          Carl.

                         TOM
          Daddy!
          Wild with fear, Bonnie and Tom run toward Bush.

                         BONNIE
          Stop it!! Get away!
          Gary, the Worker burst from the diner but see the brake
          handle in Bush's hand and slow down.
          Bush comes to himself, sees everyone staring, sees Carl in
          tears, and now Tom and Bonnie, trying to get him away..
          Gary and the others slowly move toward Bush. More patrons
          step out from the diner.
          Buddy races up, sees Mule bleeding, and eyes Bush as he grabs
          the reins and leads Mule down Main street, still holding the
          brake handle.

                         CARL

                         (GASPING)
          I'll kill him!
          Bonnie shushes him softly as Carl moans in pain.
          Tom stares after Bush, mirroring his father's hatred.

          23 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 23 

          An EMPTY CASKET, awaits its passenger in a small but
          serviceable funeral hall. Through the office door, FRANK
          QUINN sits at his desk, his head completely buried behind a
          paper that he shakes hard every few seconds. His feet are up
          on the desk revealing a pair of lovely burgundy silk socks.

          24 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - SAME 24

           Frank's hand slips the flask next to his coffee cup into a
           drawer when he HEARS the front door open. But his face
           remains hidden as Buddy enters. Buddy is troubled by the
          fight.

                         BUDDY
          Frank?
          (off Frank's grunt)
          There was a fight. It was..

                         FRANK
          .let me guess. Hmm. Carl?

                         BUDDY
          Well yeah but this time it was with
          that old man Bush.

                         FRANK
          Old man?

                         (DISTANTLY HOPEFUL)
          Is there a body?

                         BUDDY
          No, the old man did the beating.
          Never seen anything like it.

                         FRANK
          Social event of the year and I
          missed it.
          Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear. He has no
          southern accent and doesn't look small town.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         FRANK
          Read the paper today?
          (off Buddy's no)
          Something strange is happening in
          the world right now.

                         BUDDY
          What?

                         FRANK
          People are dying in bunches.
          (off Buddy's look)
          Everywhere. But here.
          He puts the paper down and studies his socks.

                         FRANK
          I wonder what the odds are of a
          funeral home going broke? I mean
          you have a business everybody on
          earth needs, you can't make that
          work, it's got to be you right? And
          yet.. I don't know.. what do you do
          when people won't die?

                         BUDDY
          Well..

                         FRANK
          Onethingabout Chicago, people
          knowhowto die; they drown, get
          runover,shot, whatever it takes.

                         BUDDY
          We get it done down here, we're
          just not in a hurry about it.

                         FRANK
          It's them or us.
          Frank sighs and stares forlornly out at a casket.

                         BUDDY

                         (QUIETLY)
          I might know someone who is looking
          for a funeral.
          Frank's eyes crawl over to him.

          30 EXT./INT. FRONTAGE ROAD/FRANK'S CAR - DAY 30

          The Quinn Funeral Home Packard Hearse makes it way down the
          road. Frank drives as Buddy searches ahead.

                         FRANK
          How much did he have?

                         BUDDY
          It was all wadded up.

                         FRANK
          Ooo, hermit money. That's good.
          Buddy sees Bush's signs.

                         BUDDY
          There it is..

          31 INT/EXT. FRANK'S CAR/FRONTAGE ROAD - DAY 31

          They stop at Bush's sign: 'No Damn Trespassing." Frank
          squints up at the old shack and doesn't like what he sees at
          all. Buddy opens his door but Frank doesn't.

                         BUDDY
          What are you doing?

                         FRANK
          You've been wanting a shot at
          sales..

                         BUDDY
          But..

                         FRANK
          As of right now, you're on
          commission.
          (off Buddy's look)
          Remember; foot in the door,
          establish trust, and drop the
          hammer.
          Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack.

                         BUDDY
          I'd feel better if you'd go too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         FRANK
          No doubt but if you don't do this
          by yourself, you won't know if
          you're any good. And you'll never
          be any good if you don't know you
          are. Go get him!

          32 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 32

          As Buddy uneasily approaches the shack, he feels the
          beautiful stillness and mystery of the place. He KNOCKS
          timidly on the door, pressing an ear to listen.

                         BUDDY
          Hello?
          Nothing. He shoots a look back to the hearse - miles away,
          and knocks a little louder. Nothing. He inches to the window
          and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to
          slide away..

          CLICK.
          Buddy spins and discovers Bush standing on the ground behind
          him, his shotgun barrel pointed between Buddy's eyes.

                         BUSH
          Want to see in my house, do you?
          BOOM! Bush blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at
          Buddy's head.

                         BUSH
          How's it look?
          Buddy closes his eyes, his last words are for his wife..

                         BUDDY
          Oh, Katie..
          It makes Bush peek out from behind the barrel.

                         BUS H
          You was at the church with your
          wife and baby.
          Buddy opens his eyes and can't believe he is still alive.

                         BUDDY
          Yes, sir.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         BUSH
          What the hell you doing here?

                         BUDDY
          I can't remember.

                         BUSH
          What?
          They stand there while Buddy thinks..

                         BUDDY
          Oh yeah, I heard.. you wanted a
          funeral.

                         BUSH
          Funeral?

                         BUSH
          Yes sir. I work at uh.. I work at..
          (tries to think of it)
          .Quinn Funeral Home. I thought I
          could help you.
          Bush glances at his blown out window: 'Damn'. He lowers his
          gun, walks up onto the porch.

                         BUS H
          You like rabbit?

                         BUDDY
          What?
          Bush goes inside.
          Buddy looks desperately back at the hearse but can't see
          Frank. He doesn't know whether to run for it or not.

          33 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 33

          The shack is spare as a monk's chamber but has wonderful HAND
          MADE FURNITURE in it.

                         BUSH
          Sit down.
          There is only chair at the table so Buddy dumps the glass off
          a small stool under the window and sits down low. The wonder
          of not being dead makes him look at everything with new eyes.
          On a window sill he sees a beautiful little CARVED MULE
          emerging from a block of wood.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Bush is at the stove tending to a iron skillet of rabbit
          pieces covered with bacon and white gravy.

                         BUSH
          It's how you put things together,
          see? Some things go, some things
          never will. Indians said that
          everything spoke to them. That's
          how they made medicine and knew
          what to eat. Things talked to them
          clear as we talk. You believe that?

                         BUDDY
          I.. I don't know, sir.

                         BUSH
          If you don't listen you won't hear
          nothing.
          Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down.
          Buddy is so low he can look under the table and sees how the
          table legs run right into the top without screws or nails.

                         BUDDY
          Did you make this furniture, sir?
          Never seen any like it. Can't even
          tell what's holding it up.

                         BUSH
          Magic.
          Buddy looks up. Bush is dead serious. The word lingers.
          Finally..

                         BUDDY
          Alright. Well. Sir, if you do want
          to plan for a funeral service,
          which I hope will be a long long
          time away, we'd treat you with
          respect and offer a good..

                         BUSH
          What'd everybody say about what
          happened in town?

                         BUDDY
          I don't..

                         BUSH
          That crazy old son of a bitch tried
          to beat a man to death for no
          reason? That it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          Buddy is caught off guard by Bush's lucid candor and finds
          himself automatically responding differently to him.

                         BUDDY
          There's two sides to every story.
          As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddy's old yellowed plate..

                         BUSH
          People say that. But they don't
          mean it. They think what they think
          and they don't want to know
          anything else.

                         BUDDY
          Yes, sir, but I think people are so
          scared of what they don't know that
          they make things up to feel better
          about it.

                         BUSH
          Like life after dying. Heaven.

                         BUDDY

                         (THINKS)
          I hope that part's true, don't you?

                         (BEAT)
          But I don't think we know the
          actual truth about much of
          anything. I know I don't. I'm just
          guessing most of the time.
          Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the
          rabbit. Fearing the worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes
          a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise..

                         BUDDY
          Lord, that's good..

                         BUS H
          You boys been coming out here to
          throw rocks through my window for
          20-30 years.

                         BUDDY
          I never..

                         BUSH
          Ya'll know lots of stories about
          me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         BUDDY

                         (SQUIRMS)
          Yes, sir, I guess, but..

                         BUSH
          Tell one.

                         BUDDY
          I'd rather not.
          Bush eases forward, his eyes slit. The old Bush is back.

                         BUSH
          I rather you did.

                         BUDDY
          (startled/leans back)
          Well. When I was kid I heard you
          killed some men in a fist fight.

                         BUSH
          Is that all?
          Bush leans back stone-faced.
          In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous
          carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and
          long face that are being born from the rough block. It makes
          him smile. But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole
          through him.

                         BUS H
          What's your name again?

                         BUDDY
          Buddy Robinson, sir.

                         BUS H
          Well, if I need you -- I know where
          you are.
          It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops
          eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that
          he's been dismissed.

          34 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 34

          Buddy heads to the hearse, glancing back over his shoulder.
          As he recalls his encounter, he stops, looking back at the
          shack. The old legend has gotten deep under his skin.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         35 OMITTED 35

          35A EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD 35A

          The morning sun breaks over the mountains.

          36 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - MORNING 36

          Bush is on the porch, straining boiled herbs, grass, and bark
          into a jar. There is something not right with him and he
          knows it. While the medicine cools he looks out across the
          mountain and draws a deep breath.

          37 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MORNING 37

           A well crafted live-in home doubling as a funeral parlor. A
          sign, 'QUINN FUNERAL HOME', hangs from the porch.

          FRANK (O.S.)
          Oh yes Ma'am, I do respect your
          wishes but you see..

          38 INT. FUNERAL HOME/FRANK'S OFFICE - SAME 38

          Frank is looking a little hung over. Buddy walks in. Frank
          points at the phone and rolls his blood shot eyes.

                         FRANK
          .state law requires.. No ma'am, we
          can't bury him under the house..
          There is a loud KNOCK at the door. Buddy goes to get it.

          39 EXT. FUNERAL HOME/FRONT DOOR - DAY 39

          Buddy swings the door open. Bush is standing there. Buddy
          leans back unconsciously, not knowing what to expect.

          FRANK (O.S.)
          Well just for argument's sake,
          Ma'am, how would we get the casket
          under the house? No casket?

                         BUDDY

                         (TO BUSH)
          Would you like to come in, sir?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          Bush stares suspiciously into the room then back at Buddy.

          FRANK (O.S.)
          But you have to have a container of
          some kind, Ma'am for decency and
          uh, sanitation.
          Bush enters the Funeral Home. As Buddy starts to close the
          door, Bush catches it.

                         BUSH
          Leave it.

          40 INT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS 40

          Frank is still on the phone and pouring himself a drink from
          the flask into his coffee cup in the drawer.

                         FRANK
          Yes, Ma'am, but there's lots of
          natural things that aren't decent.
          (listens, eyes widen)
          He did what?! Good God. No, Ma'am,
          I didn't know that about your
          husband. Well, yeah now I
          understand why you want him under
          the house but still..
          The phone goes dead. FRANK sighs as Bush walks in.

                         BUDDY
          Frank Quinn, Mr. Bush.
          Frank takes a quick swallow from his cup to fortify himself,
          then jumps up, smiling, and goes to Bush with his hand out.

                         FRANK
          Come in, come in, pleasure. Coffee?
          As Bush shakes Frank's hand, he stares into him, taking
          everything in, his bloodshot eyes, the wrinkled shirt beneath
          his suit, his breath. Frank feels downright naked.

                         BUSH
          You from anywhere?

                         FRANK
          A little bit of everywhere, I
          guess. Get him a chair, Buddy!
          Buddy stands behind the waiting chair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.
          Bush scrapes up a different chair. Frank goes behind the
          desk. Buddy pulls up a chair.
          Bush reaches into his coat and pulls out the wad of hermit
          money and lays it on the desk. Frank does something
          phenomenal. He ignores the money.

                         FRANK
          How can we help you, sir?
          Bush gives Buddy a look, then looks back at Frank who
          steadfastly refuses to look at the ball of money.

                         BUSH
          I'm after a funeral.

                         FRANK
          Boy, are you in luck.

                         (GETTING UP)
          Follow me.

          41 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 41

          Frank and Buddy stand with Bush in a room dedicated to sales.
          Three caskets are lined up for display. All tanks.
          Bush steps up to a cheap cloth covered box, bangs it with his
          knuckles, and scowls. Frank points to a wooden casket.

                         FRANK
          Solid pecan, steel handles..
          Bush eyes it, repulsed.

                         BUDDY
          Mr. Bush is an amazing carpenter.

                         BUSH
          Forget the box. What else?

                         FRANK
          Whatever you want, flowers..

                         BUSH
          No.

                         FRANK
          Burial plot..

                         BUSH
          Got it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         FRANK
          A service?

                         BUSH
          Party.

                         FRANK
          A what?

                         BUSH
          A party.

                         BUDDY
          What kind of party?

                         BUSH
          Funeral party.
          Stumped for once in his life, Frank looks at Buddy. Then
          years of honed instincts surge back to life.

                         FRANK
          We can do that.

          42 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - DAY 42

          As they come back into the office..

                         BUSH
          And I want to be there.
          Frank goes behind his desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit..

                         FRANK
          You will be, I guarantee it.

                         BUSH
          I want to be there now.

                         BUDDY
          You want to be at your funeral..
          party.. alive?
          (off Bush's nod)
          But.. it's not a funeral if you're
          not, you know, deceased..

                         FRANK
          Hold on now, it's a detail, we can
          look at it.

                         BUDDY
          Pretty big detail.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          Frank cuts Buddy a look then smiles at Bush.

                         FRANK
          So you'd like to have a funeral
          party while you're alive so you can
          go?

                         BUSH
          Yes or no?

                         FRANK
          Yes.
          Buddy is lost.

                         FRANK
          Buddy, get some paper. We need to
          make of list of who Mr. Bush wants
          to invite..
          As Buddy starts to get up.

                         BUSH
          Sit down.
          Buddy sits right down.

                         BUSH
          I want everybody to come who's got
          a story to tell about me.

                         FRANK
          Say again.

                         BUDDY
           That probably covers 4 counties..
           Bush shoots him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks
           about how great an outdoor life would be.

                          BUSH
          Then I want 4 counties worth of
           people at the party.

                         FRANK
          Well, sir, the thing is, how would
          you get people to come and tell
          stories about you that I'm guessing
          might get them, you know.. shot?
          Bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out. Now all Frank
          can see is the money, leaving.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         FRANK
          You know what, you go ahead, don't
          worry about it, we'll think of
          something. A couple of ideas just
          came to me.

                         BUDDY
          Like what?

          43 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 43

          As Bush starts out the open door, he nearly bumps into
          Buddy's wife, Kathryn, and MATTIE DARROW. Mattie is carrying
          Kathryn and Buddy's baby boy.
          Frank sees Mattie and flicks his hair back nervously and
          quickly brushes his teeth with his finger as..
          .Bush gives Mattie a glance and tries to be invisible.

                         MATTIE
          Felix?!
          Feigning deafness, Bush walks on. Sensing something, Kathryn
          takes the baby so Mattie can go after him.

                         MATTIE
          Felix! Say hello to me!
          Frank, eyes wide with surprise, mouths, "Felix?".
          Bush's shoulder hunch then fall as he turns. He looks into
          her, taking everything in. When he speaks his eyes and voice
          are soft.

                         BUSH
          Hey Mattie.
          Buddy comes out, surprised to see Mattie and Bush together.
          Frank walks up behind him and scowls. Kathryn steers them
          back inside to give Mattie privacy.

                         BUSH
          Heard you moved off.

                         MATTIE
          I've been back a while.

                         BUSH

                         (LOOKING AWAY)
          Well.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         MATTIE
          How are you?

                         BUSH
          You look like you always did.
          He abruptly rips himself away and is gone.

          44 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 44

          Buddy and Frank are peeking out the window. They see Mattie
          standing alone as Bush walks away.

                         FRANK
          How would she know him?

          KATHRYN (O.S.)
          It's none of our business.

                         FRANK
          So? We got to know.
          Kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside. FRANK has
          another look at Mattie then lets the curtain fall back.

                         FRANK
          See the size of that thing?

                         BUDDY
          What?

                         FRANK
          What do you mean, what? Goddamn
          ball of money! He wants a party
          with pink balloons on his ears,
          we're gonna give it to him.

                         BUDDY
          But..

                         FRANK
          I sold 26 of the ugliest cars ever
          made one December, in Chicago, with
          wind blowing so hard up my ass I
          was farting snow flakes in July so
          don't tell me we can't do this.

                         BUDDY
          But..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         FRANK
          That's the last "but" I want to
          hear out of you. You're a salesman
          now, sell!

                         FRANK
          (looking out again)
          She called him Felix.

          45 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 45

           Kathryn rocks the baby in a carriage. Mattie is beside her.

                         MATTIE
          A thousand years ago he was the
          most interesting man I'd ever met.

                         KATHRYN
          Get out of here.

                         MATTIE
          He was. And I don't mean just the
          way he looked.

                         KATHRYN
          I hope not.

                         MATTIE
          Oh no, listen, he was beautiful.

                         KATHRYN
          Are you serious?

                         MATTIE

                         (SIGHS/THINKS)
          Most people are just laid out nice
          and simple, you know? You always
          know what they're thinking and
          where you are with them. But he was
          this.. big old cave that went
          deeper and deeper. You'd never get
          to the end of him.

                         KATHRYN
          Good Lord, you had a crush on him!

                         MATTIE
          All the girls did. I know he's
          something wild that crawls out of
          the hills once in a while and gets
          into trouble now but there's still
          nobody like him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          46 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 46

           Bush comes out of the barn. Frank and Buddy are there.

                         FRANK
          We have a plan. All we need is a
          little bit of your time.

                         BUSH
          What for?

                         BUDDY
          Seeing it is better than hearing
          about it.
          Bush looks at the hearse, back at Buddy and Frank.

                         BUSH
          How much is it gonna cost?

                         FRANK

                         (TO BUDDY)
          Did you say anything about money?
          (touches his own chest)
          I didn't say anything about money.

                         (TO BUSH)
          If we can't get you what you want
          you don't owe us anything.

          47 INT. HEARSE - DAY 47

          Frank, Buddy, and Bush ride in the front seat of the hearse.
          They are together but in very different worlds. They don't
          even look at each other when they talk.
          Buddy is lost in serious thought.
          Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast.
          Bush is scrunched up to the door. He is going much faster
          than he is used to going. He kinda likes it and kinda
          doesn't.

                         BUSH
          It moves, don't it?

                         FRANK

                         (DISTRACTED)
          This is nothing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         BUSH
          Fancy car for the dead.

                         FRANK
          Didn't buy it for them.

                         BUDDY
          (out of nowhere)
          We say that funerals are "For the
          Living" but we forget what that
          means sometimes, I guess.
          (to Bush but almost to

                         HIMSELF)
          I was thinking about your funeral
          party before I went to sleep last
          night and I think I understand it a
          little now. When I was a kid, my
          folks where killed in a bad car
          wreck and the people at the funeral
          home... they did the impossible as
          far as I was concerned. I don't
          know what I would've done without
          them. And I remember wishing that
          my mother and daddy were there to
          see how beautiful they made
          everything.
          Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush
          glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at the
          world rushing by too fast. All at once he gives in to it.

          48 EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY 48

          The hearse pulls up on main street. Frank, Buddy, and Bush
          get out and head toward Feldman's Clothing Store.

          48A INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE- DAY 48A

          Frank and Buddy enter the store and find MR. FELDMAN and a
          PHOTOGRAPHER setting up a large camera and backdrop. As they
          turn to show Bush what is happening they see him go by the
          window outside.

                         FRANK
          Where's he going?

                         49 OMIT 49

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          50 INT. TOLLERUDE'S BARBER SHOP - DAY 50

           A barber's drape falls over BUSH who is seated in a chair.
          Frank and Buddy rush in. The barber, an anxious Mr.
          Tollerude, pumps Bush's chair upward.

                         FRANK

                         (TO BUSH)
          I wish you wouldn't do that yet.
          Bush gives him the hairy eyeball then speaks to Mr.
          Tollerude, a clear threat.

                         BUSH
          Don't leave me naked.

                         FRANK
          Mr. Bush, you can get all the hairs
          cut you want after we take your
          picture, I'll pay for it.
          Mr. Tollerude doesn't know whether to cut or not.

                         BUSH
          Why you want my picture made?

                         BUDDY
          That's what we're trying to tell
          you. We're gonna run an ad in some
          papers about your party and put up
          posters of you.

                         BUSH
          And you want me to look like this?

                         FRANK
          Yes.

                         BUSH
          Why?

                         FRANK
          Why?

                         BUDDY
          It's how people recognize you, sir.

                         FRANK
          And you want as many people to come
          as possible so..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         BUSH
          So a crazy old nutter draws more.

                         FRANK
          Basically. Don't you think?

                         BUSH
          Do you ever say what you mean?
          Bush rips the bib off as Tollerude whooshes him to the floor.

          51 INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE 51

          Bush is seated in front of a backdrop painted with a bridge,
          a swan, and a pond. The Photographer is trying to tidy up
          Bush without offending him. As he walks back to camera, Bush
          roughs himself up and looks truly wild.
          Buddy snickers. When the Photographer gets back to the
          camera, he cocks his head, what?!

                         FRANK
          Take it.
          (leans in to Buddy)
          I'd go see that.

          52 INT. TOLLERUDE'S BARBERSHOP - DAY 52

          Mr. Tollerude, nervous as hell, brings Bush up from his
          reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror.
          Bush studies his well trimmed hair and beard for a moment.
          It's impossible to tell what his thoughts are as he looks
          into his own eyes.
          Buddy and Frank are in the mirror too, staring at him.

                         BUDDY

                         (GENUINELY SURPRISED)
          Damn. You look pretty good..
          Bush suddenly gets up and nods at Frank.

                         BUSH
          He's paying.
          As Bush blows out the door, Mr. Tollerude leans against the
          chair with relief.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          53 INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE - DAY 53

          Bush stands in front of a full length mirror. He has on a
          decent black suit, pinned to be hemmed, and a plain white
          shirt, open at the collar. It is a startling change. But we
          still can't tell what he is thinking.
          Buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief.
          Frank is quietly trying to get Mr. Feldman to lower the price
          for the suit. He looks over and double-takes Bush.

                         FRANK
          Son of a bitch, it's almost worth
          it.

                         BUSH

                         (TO BUDDY)
          What do you think?

                         BUDDY
          I wouldn't know you, sir.

                         BUSH
          Maybe the Devil won't either. Might
          work out.

                         (TO FRANK)
          Where's the shoes?

                         FRANK
          Well, normally people don't wear
          shoes in a casket so..
          (off Bush's scowl)
          .what are you, about a 10D?

          54 INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE - MOMENTS LATER 54

          Buddy stands beside Frank who is still trying to get a deal
          on the clothes. Bush walks up with two pairs of pants and two
          new shirts, puts them on the counter, gives Frank a hard
          look, and walks away. Frank looks down at the clothes, over
          at Buddy.

                         FRANK
          Pretty optimistic taking a change
          of clothes to the grave.
          (calls over his shoulder)
          How you set for underwear?

          BUSH (O.S.)
          Don't wear none.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         FRANK
          One question too many.

                         55 OMIT 55

          56 INT. HEARSE - DAY 56

          Everyone is back in the hearse. Something is eating at Frank.

                         FRANK
          I don't mean to be nosey but uh..
          how do you know Mattie?

                         BUSH
          She's a peach.
          Frank and Buddy cut Bush a look. He looks ahead.

                         BUSH
          We had a go.
          Frank nearly drives off the road.

          57 INT. FUNERAL HOME/ FRANK'S ROOM - NIGHT 57

          Late night Poker. Cigarette smoke drifts into the air.
          Frank, Carl, Rev. Horton, Mattie, and RAY, a banker, are at
          the table. Ray has the untouchable presence of someone
          privileged which appears to be driving Frank up a tree
          tonight. Horton gathers up his winnings.

                         HORTON
          "The Lord loves a cheerful giver.."

                         MATTIE
          Oh please.. you think the Lord's
          taking sides in a poker game in a
          funeral home?
          Horton shrugs and points to the divine evidence.

                         FRANK
          If He is, the Divine's cheating.

                         RAY
          Exactly.

                         FRANK
          Don't agree with me Ray, it makes
          me doubt myself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Ray sighs and studies his perfectly cut nails.

                         RAY
          I would have turned down your loan
          if you were my own dear mother,
          Frank.

                         FRANK
          You made my point and don't even
          know it.

                         MATTIE
          Jesus, would you two stop it!
          You're worse than two old women..
           Ray shrugs, sweetly blase. Frank tries to rein in his temper
           for her. The loss of the hand is especially hard on Carl who
          has only a couple of dollars left.

                         CARL

                         (TO FRANK)
          What were you doing with that old
          bastard in town today, anyway?

                         RAY
          Oh yes. Buying him clothes, getting
          him a haircut..on credit.
          Frank shoots him a look.

                         HORTON
          Took out ads in a bunch of papers
          too, something about a party?

                         FRANK
          God, I love small towns.

                         MATTIE
          Who are you talking about?

                         RAY
          That hermit, what's his name..

                         FRANK
          (a knowing look at Mattie)
          "Felix" Bush.

                         MATTIE
          You're giving him a party?

                         FRANK
          A funeral party.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         MATTIE
          Whatever you're drinking is not
          being good to you at all.

                         CARL
          What the hell is a funeral party?

                         FRANK
          Hey, the man wants to be at his own
          funeral. What can I say? I'd like
          to be at my funeral so I could tell
          my ex-wife to kiss my..

                         MATTIE
          What makes you think she'd show up
          for you?

                         FRANK
          Because, Dear, vultures are
          constitutionally unable to ignore
          the dead.
          Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end.
          Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank.

                         HORTON
          It's that big wad of money of his
          you're after.
          There is a crack in Ray's disinterest that he tries to hide.

                         RAY
          What money is that?

                         MATTIE
          Felix has money?
          Everyone is looking at Frank but he shuffles the cards.

                         HORTON
          He came to see me, wanting a
          funeral, had a big old greasy ball
          of money. Talked like he thought he
          could buy his way to heaven with
          it.

                         RAY

                         (SERIOUSLY)
          How much has he got? Maybe he can.
          Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is
          suddenly truly concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         MATTIE
          Is he sick, Gus?
          Horton shrugs. Frank notes the concern and doesn't like it.
          Carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat.

                         CARL
          I'll tell you one damn thing, ain't
          nobody gonna go to a funeral for
          that son of a bitch.
          Mattie gives Carl a look

                         HORTON
          Language..

                         FRANK
          They might. He's inviting everyone
          who has a story about him to come.
          You could tell about him kicking
          your ass, Carl.
          Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him.

                         RAY
          Old man is going to ride the Weird
          Train right into the ground, isn't
          he?

                         FRANK
          Wouldn't you like to know what
          everybody says about you behind
          your back, Ray?
          (off his look)
          Yeah, probably not.

                         HORTON
          I already know way more about
          people than I need to.

                         MATTIE
          Or want to.

                         HORTON
          Amen.

                         FRANK
          Let's play some cards.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         RAY
          Oh for God's sake, face it Frank,
          you're broke.
          This is not about cards. It's a declaration meant to
          embarrass Frank in front of everyone. Frank feels their eyes
          on him as he starts to pull off his watch. Ray waves it off.

                         RAY
          Please. I've won that 4 times
          already.

                         FRANK
          It's who has it last that counts.

                         CARL
          Say what you want but if there
          hadn't been anybody there the other
          day he would've killed me. And I
          guarantee you it wouldn't have been
          his first time.
          It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie.

                         MATTIE
          Everybody knows you started it.
          (off his glare)
          Don't look at me like that. I
          remember when you were born. You
          were the sweetest little boy. What
          is wrong with you?
          Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a
          better man there. He struggles to hold on to it but..

                         CARL
          I made a mistake. But there's a
          line.. and he crossed it.. and
          everybody knows that too. Ya'll go
          on and have a party with the devil
          for his money but I'll dance on his
          grave someday.
          Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out.

                         HORTON
          You kind of hate to admit it when
          it comes to Carl but he's got a
          point. You don't know what Bush is
          doing. What if he just wants to get
          everybody in one place so he can
          turn his shotgun on them?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         MATTIE
          He wouldn't..

                         HORTON
          I looked in his eyes. The truth is
          nobody knows what he's capable of.
          Maybe even he doesn't know.
          She looks into him. Frank starts to deal the cards.

                         RAY
          Go ahead and lay your watch down,
          Frank. But I am going to keep it
          this time, alright, on principle.

                         FRANK
          I got an idea. Let's try something
          different.

                         (TO RAY)
          The cards in your sock? Leave'em
          there.
          Everyone freezes. Ray shakes his head.

                         RAY
          What are you trying to pull now?

                         FRANK
          You really think you're that good
          that nobody sees?

                         RAY
          Sees what?

                         FRANK
          You cheat at everything you do.
          Even at the bank, you loan people
          just enough to get'em deeper in so
          you can foreclose on them.

                         RAY
          You are a pathetic man. And a
          goddamn..

                         FRANK
          Am I? Then stand up and roll down
          your socks.
          (a deep dark look)
          Stand up or I'll stand you up.
           Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is
           irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank's chair
          scraping the floor makes him jerk up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         39
          He walks out, trying to find his old confident rhythm and
          failing. Everyone sits in uneasy silence.

          58 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 58

           Horton waves and walks out, leaving the door open. Frank
           walks Mattie to the door, helping with her coat, trying to
          work up his nerve to say..

                         FRANK
          I'll walk you home.

                         MATTIE
          No. Thank you.

                         FRANK

                         (HURT)
          You sure?
          (off her firm nod)
          You're not going to play anymore,
          are you?

                         MATTIE
          Oh, I don't know. Thank you for
          inviting me though.

                         FRANK
          I'm sorry about the..we don't
          always fight, okay, we do, but he's
          had that coming for..

                         MATTIE
          It's not that. I just..(trails off)

                         FRANK
          You came because you don't know
          what to do with yourself.
          (off her look)
          I slept on the same side of the bed
          my whole life, right? But after my
          wife left me, I switched sides,
          just like that, and never been able
          to go back.

                         MATTIE
          When someone you love is gone, you
          can pour everything, even a
          lifetime of things into the place
          where they were but it's still
          always empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          He sees that her thoughts are not with him at all but a
          million miles away. She hardly glances up when she says..

                         MATTIE
          'Night.
          He stares after her, wishing that she could see him the way
          he sees her.

                         59 OMIT 59

          60 INT.BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 60

          Dim lamp light glows. We see Bush sitting on the edge of the
          bed wiping the sweat from his face with a sheet. He looks up
          at the picture of the beautiful woman.

          61 INT.BUDDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 61

          Buddy sits in the dark, rocking his son who is asleep. A
          small lamp casts a shadow across them. Kathryn comes in.

                         KATHRYN
          I didn't hear him wake up.

                         BUDDY
          He didn't.

                         KATHRYN

                         (KNEELING DOWN)
          Everything's all right, hon.

                         BUDDY
          I'm glad you don't know how quick
          it can change.
          She gently kisses his arm and the baby's head. Buddy looks at
          her, haunted by the very possibility of their absence.

          62 EXT. STREET - DAY 62

          Mattie is standing on the sidewalk at Feldman's store with
          her coat collar pulled up against the cold, giving someone we
          can't see a bemused affectionate scolding..

                         MATTIE
          Good Lord. Have you completely lost
          your mind?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40A.
          MATTIE (cont`d)
          Straighten up for heaven's sake
          before somebody throws a net over
          you! 
          But she smiles in spite of herself, glances around to see if 
          anyone was watching and moves discretely on. As she does we 
          see that she was talking to a striking WANTED POSTER of a 
          wild man sitting in front of a pond, a swan, and a bridge.
          The text reads: 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          MYSTERIOUS HERMIT OF CALEB COUNTY THROWS A FUNERAL PARTY!

          EVERYONE IS INVITED. MUSIC! FOOD! STORIES! DANCING!

                          

          63 INT. WCGM RADIO STATION - NIGHT 63

          A tiny PLACE, cramped with radio gear.
          Buddy and Frank peer through a glass window into a small
          control booth.(We will cut back and forth between the glass)
          Buddy is having misgivings about being here. But Frank gives
          the thumbs up to the young WCGM ANNOUNCER in the booth, a
          hopeful kid with a smooth voice and dreams of the big-time.
          The Announcer hands Bush a set of headphones. Bush is wearing
          his new clothes and truly looks like a different man.
          Bush is puzzled by the headset. The kid takes it and clamps
          it onto Bush's head. He starts to yank them off then hears a
          song playing inside his head and loves it. But now the
          announcer cuts the record off and Bush scowls.

                         ANNOUNCER
          Friends, we have a treat for you
          today on WCGM. Our special guest is
          going to tell us about an event
          that everyone is talking about. And
          here he is, Mr. Felix Bush, the
          mysterious hermit of Caleb County!
          How are you today, sir?

                         BUSH
          I am.
          Bush is surprised by the sound of his own voice.

                         ANNOUNCER
          So tell us, sir, exactly how did
          you come up with the idea of having
          a funeral party before you die?

                         BUSH
          I dreamed it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         ANNOUNCER
          Really?

                         BUSH
          Why would I make that up?
          Two seconds of dead air as the announcer finds his feet.

                         ANNOUNCER
          Okay. Now I have to say that you
          don't look quite like you do on the
          posters.

                         BUSH
          I got pruned.

                         ANNOUNCER
          Well, you're a bit of a local
          legend, sir. I was a little nervous
          about our interview. I've heard
          some pretty wild stories..

                         BUSH
          Like what?

                         ANNOUNCER
          Well uh, just.. from what I
          understand, you want everyone who
          has a story about you to come and
          tell it. Is that right?

                         BUSH
          You come and tell yours.

                         ANNOUNCER
          Thank you. Now how long have you
          been living out there by yourself?

          64 INT. MATTIE DARROW HOUSE - NIGHT/CONTINUOUS 64

          Mattie is cutting the stems of some lovely yellow flowers and
          arranging them in a vase.

           BUSH (O.S.)
          40 some years.

           ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          40 years with nobody to talk to?

           BUSH (O.S.)
          First 38 are the hardest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          Mattie grins.

          65 INT. WCGM - CONTINUOUS 65


                         ANNOUNCER
          But why would you do that, Mr.
          Bush, shut yourself off like that?
          Frank isn't happy with this but Buddy wants to hear.

                         BUSH
          Come to the funeral and maybe
          you'll find out.

                         ANNOUNCER
          You heard it here on WCGM, folks,
          find out the answer to the mystery
          February 16..

                         BUSH
          One more thing, boy.
          FRANK and Buddy tense. What's this?

          66 INT. DARROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 6 6

          Mattie tenses at the sound in Bush's voice.

          BUSH (O.S.)
          Gonna be a drawing.

           ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
           What kind of drawing, sir?

                          BUSH
           You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day
           of the funeral we draw names. Then
           when I die, the winner gets my
           place, 300 acres of timber that
           hasn't been touched in 40 years.
           Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower.

          67 INT. WCGM - SAME 67

           Dead air. The kid, Frank, and Buddy are all staring at Bush.

                          ANNOUNCER
          For 5 dollars?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         BUSH
          Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home.
          Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost
          yelps! Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad.

                         ANNOUNCER
          You heard him! If you want a chance
          to win 300 acres of virgin timber
          worth thousands and thousands of
          dollars, send 5 dollars along with
          your name and address to..
          (off Frank waving and
          pointing to himself)
          Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home.
          As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head in time
          with the music. Frank and Buddy rush into the control booth.

                         FRANK

                         (TO BUSH)
          I could almost kiss you on the
          mouth!

                         ANNOUNCER
          I'll take a ticket.

                         BUDDY
          You're betting on a man dying..

                         ANNOUNCER
          I didn't mean it like..

                         FRANK
          Hey, it's his idea!
          They look at Bush who has taken off the headset and looking
          at it like he wants to take it home.

                         FRANK
          It's what you want, right?

                         BUSH

                         (TO BUDDY)
          Buy a ticket, son.

          68 INT. DARROW HOUSE - SAME 6 8

          Mattie puts the vase of flowers on table with a group of
          family photographs. The picture beside the vase is the SAME
          PHOTOGRAPH of the beautiful woman that Bush has. Is it
          Mattie? It looks a little like her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          INSERT PHOTO: The BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN stares at us as we
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we are now looking at the identical
          photo tacked to Bush's wall.

          70 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - LATE DAY 70

          Bush starts out of the barn, draws back, and peeks through
          the wall boards: A FIGURE approaches. He jerks..
          REVEAL Mattie walking

                         BUSH
          Mattie?

                         MATTIE
          Felix?
          Mattie enters, straining to see into the barn. Her eyes
          adjust to find him standing near Mule. She is startled and
          pleased by his new do.

                         MATTIE
          Look at you. I wondered if you were
          still under that beard.

                         BUSH
          Wasn't nowhere else to go.

                         MATTIE
          I heard you on the radio.

                         BUSH
          Well.

                         MATTIE
          You've gotten downright chatty.

                         BUSH
          I reckon so.

                         MATTIE

                         (GLANCING AROUND)
          This is nice. I drove by a few
          times after I got back but..

                         BUSH
          You want to see it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         MATTIE
          Do you want me to?

          71 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY 71

          The first stop on the tour is a small fenced grave site near
          the shack. Three grave markers with names carved into them:

          KEEPER, CHARLIE, MAUDE.
          Bush is squatting down staring at the markers. Mattie stands
          close beside him. Since his attention is elsewhere she looks
          at him in an unguarded way. Her mind is full of questions,
          old and new.

                         BUSH
          You always know where you stand
          with a dog. Want to lay here with
          them someday if they'll have me.

                          

          72 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY/LATER 72

          Mattie and Bush walks side by side through the last of the
          glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees. It is a
          chilly and Mattie's cheeks are flushed. She is enchanted by
          the place. Bush tries to hide how winded he is..

                         MATTIE
          It really is beautiful. Probably
          looked like this everywhere a
          hundred years ago.

                         BUSH
          You leave things alone, they know
          what to do.

                         MATTIE
          Like you?

                         BUSH
          No, Ma'am. I don't know what to do
          about anything much.

                         MATTIE
          You've been alone a long time.

                         BUSH
          Some people are more suited to it
          than others, I reckon.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46A.

                         MATTIE
          That's funny cause I never thought
          that it'd suit you. I knew you
          wouldn't be like anybody else but..
          no one to talk to, no one to.. be
          with.. never.
          He looks into her then looks away at something.

                         BUSH
          How you sleeping these days, girl?

                         MATTIE
          How am I what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         BUSH
          You sleep good?

                         MATTIE
          No, not lately. How'd you know?
           He veers off the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back
           to her.

                          BUSH
           Chamomile, it's good when the 
           nights get long. Helps you nod off.
           She takes it and smiles up at him.

                          BUSH 
           Want to go on a ways? 

                          MATTIE 
           Yes. 

                          BUSH 
           Would you stay for supper? 

                          MATTIE 
           I don't want to be any trouble. 

                          BUSH 
           A supper guest every 30-40 years is 
           not much trouble, Girl. 

                          MATTIE 
           Alright then. 
           He holds out his arm. 

                          BUSH 
           Better stay close, some big old 
           wild cats been eating my chickens.. 
           She looks around and takes his arm. 

                          BUSH 
           .or maybe it was me.. 
           She snorts and slaps his arm but doesn't let go..

          74 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 74

          They enter the dark room together. Bush lights a lantern,
          gets a chair from a corner and holds it out for her. She sits
          and watches him check a cast iron pot on the warm stove and
          put a log on the fire. She notices the beautiful table.

                         MATTIE
          You always were good with your
          hands.
          He puts a glass of tea in front of her and sits down.

                         BUSH
          You still play the piano?

                         MATTIE
          I teach a few girls.

                         BUSH
          I got a good feeling when you
          played. Remember that time you was
          playing and the lamp burned out?
          And you went right on in the dark?
          I hear that song sometimes at
          night.
          She shrugs shyly and sips the tea. Seconds tick by.

                         MATTIE
          Sure is quiet out here.

                         BUSH
          (cocks his head)
          What?

                         MATTIE
          I said it's..
          (stops/gets the joke)
          I tried to write you at times but I
          didn't know what to say.

                         BUSH
          Well. I heard you married.

                         MATTIE
          He was a Doctor; a real good man.
          We lived in St. Louis for awhile.
          He died unexpectedly about a year
          ago. I came back here because.. I
          have no idea why.
          (sips tea/thinks)

                         49

                         MATTIE (CONT'D)
          The list of people who are gone is
          getting longer and longer and
          sometimes I feel like all I'm doing
          is waiting for my name to come up.

                         BUSH
          You have a tender heart, always
          did.
          She gives him a curious look.

                         BUSH
          You can't wait for anything,
          Mattie. Close your eyes, hold your
          breath.. stay in one spot your
          whole life, but you're still
          moving, like the world's moving
          under you. There's no waiting.

                         MATTIE
          And there's no getting over some
          things either, is there?

                         BUSH
          Reckon not, Little Bit.

                         MATTIE
          Little Bit?! Oh my God, nobody's
          called me that in..
          But suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong
           ropes. She stares at the wall as she walks toward Bush's bed.
          Bush is stricken and white. He would stop her if he could but
          it is too late.
          She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp
          light and stares into it as if it is a mirage that will
          disappear if she blinks.
          Finally she whirls and looks at him, her face a tortured
          mask. A strangled sob escapes her.
          He gets up and stands there staring at the floor.
          Suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out
          the door. Her shadow merges with the darkness. Bush stands
          with his head down, staring into oblivion.

          78 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - DAY 78 

          Buddy comes in frowning and lugging a heavy mail sack. What
          the hell? He looks up and sees more sacks dumped on the desk.
          Frank is grinning and ripping open envelopes from the sacks
          and each one has 5 dollars in it! Buddy looks down and sees
          even more mail sacks on the floor!

                         FRANK
          Jesus, kid!

                         BUDDY
          Yeah! But, but it's not our money.

                         FRANK
          Well yeah, no, but some of it's
          gonna be! We're putting this thing
          on!
          Frank rips open two more envelopes and dollar bills rain down
          to the floor. He's beside himself. Buddy eyes him warily.

                         BUDDY
          He should be here. I'm gonna go get
          him.
          They lock eyes. Frank finally tosses him the hearse keys.

                         79 OMITTED 79

          80 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - DAY 80

          Buddy, Frank, and Bush are staring reverently at the money
          stacked across the desk and the full paper sacks all around
          the desk. Bush eyes Buddy who is still quiet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         FRANK
          I don't know exactly how much your
          land's worth but looks to me like
          you could get maybe 10 times that
          or more. I don't know what to do
          with it. I mean it's yours to do
          with what you want but I'm getting
          a little nervous about it. Never
          thought I'd see enough money to
          make me nervous. We should probably
          talk about the price for
          everything, the clothes, the ads,
          the food and drink for the party,
          the music.. our fee for everything,
          we'll be fair about that, I'm not
          worried about it.
          Bush is looking at Buddy who is looking across the room.

                         BUSH
          What do you think, boy?
          Buddy jerks, looks at Frank, at Bush.

                         BUDDY
          Money makes people do funny things.
          Frank scowls.

                         BUDDY
          I think you should probably put it
          in the bank, sir.

                         FRANK
          No! Ray is not..
          (off Bush's look)
          I mean, if it was my money I'd put
          it in a bank out of town so
          everyone didn't know my business.
          This bank here, you can't trust,
          that's all I'm saying.

                         BUSH
          Can I trust you?

                         FRANK
          Every name, every dollar, is right
          there!

                         BUSH
          Not what I asked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         FRANK
          I've done a hell of a job for you.
          I don't see why..

                         BUDDY
          Mr. Bush, I didn't mean to imply..

                         BUSH
          Hush.

                         FRANK
          I've sold horses, cars, houses,
          hell, pocket watches pinned to the
          inside of my coat. I'm not ashamed
          of it. I don't rob banks, don't
          cheat at cards, and I sleep all
          right the nights I sleep. What was
          the question..?

                         BUSH
          They goddamn..
          He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the "other" Bush.

                         BUSH
          Take out for the expenses you've
          already had and give me the
          receipts. As the bills come in for
          things, give them to me and I'll
          pay them. Put this money in a box
          and the boy and I'll take it
          someplace in the morning. Whatever
          new comes in, keep it in the bottom
          of one of them ugly caskets in
          there 'till I come get it. After
          the party, name a fair price for
          what you've done and we'll settle
          up.

                         (WALKING OUT)
          I'll be at the car.
          After he's gone, Frank and Buddy stare at each other.

                         FRANK
          Is it just me or is he extremely
          fucking articulate when he wants to
          be?

                         BUDDY
          I don't know who's selling who what
          anymore.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         FRANK
          It's not clear, is it?

                         BUDDY
          Not only that but something feels
          really wrong.

                         FRANK
          Hold on. I told you that you were
          working on commission..

                         BUDDY
          Yeah, but..

                         FRANK
          So whatever our end of this is, you
          get a piece.

                         BUDDY
          A piece?

                         FRANK
          Half. It could help set you up,
          Buddy. So whatever feels wrong is
          gonna feel right pretty damn
          quick,okay? We just have to close
          it out. From here on, watch me, do
          what I do, and we'll be fine.

                         BUDDY
          But..

                         FRANK
          He wants you to go with him to take
          this money somewhere which means
          that it's you he trusts. And that's
          fine because I trust you too. Just
          don't trust him, okay?

                         BUDDY
          I'm lost again.

                         FRANK
          Look, that funny feeling you have..
          I have it too. And it's not funny.
          So go along, be friendly, but
          that's it.

                         (BEAT)
          There's a euphoria that comes with
          closing a deal, Buddy, and the
          bigger the deal, the higher you

                         FRANK (CONT'D)
          But the critical time is just
          before it closes. It's like a
          witching hour and everything tries
          to come apart. We're not going to
          let that happen.

                         BUDDY
          All right.

                         FRANK
          Now go.
          (as Buddy starts out)
          You know.. I always wondered why
          you wanted to work here. I thought
          you could do a lot better.
          (off Buddy's look back)
          I didn't know about your folks, I'm
          really sorry.

                         BUDDY
          Thank you.
          He goes on.
          Frank turns and flips through a large stack of bills,
          hungrily entranced.

          81 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 8 1

          Buddy's son is crying his heart out. Kathryn comes in
          unbuttoning her blouse, picks him up, sits down, slips her
          blouse off her shoulder, brings the boy to her breast and
          voila, his sorrow miraculously vanishes.
          Buddy appears in the doorway, his eyes soft with love.

                         BUDDY
          I might have a crying fit coming on
          too.

                         KATHRYN
          Is that right?

                         BUDDY
          Feeling a little weepy.

                         KATHRYN
          You boys..

                         BUDDY
          (leans against door frame)
          I can maybe do something really
          good for us, Katy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         KATHRYN
          You already have.

                         BUDDY
          I mean, money wise.

                         KATHRYN
          About Mr. Bush?

                         BUDDY
          Yeah. I'm getting half of whatever
          we make off of him.

                         KATHRYN
          So why aren't you happy about it?

                         BUDDY
          Didn't know I wasn't.
          (off her look)
          I was happy for a minute. And then
          the whole thing of making a
          carnival out of a person's death, I
          don't know if it's right.

                         KATHRYN
          Is it what he wants?

                         BUDDY
          He says it is.

                         KATHRYN
          You are not responsible for what
          other people do, Buddy, just you.

                         BUDDY
          You're right. You're always right.

                         KATHRYN
          At least I am when I'm half naked.

                         BUDDY
          Right.

          82 INT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 82

           A very determined little GIRL is working her way through a
           song on the piano that is unrecognizable in this form, even
           to her.
          Mattie sits just behind the girl with tears in her eyes, not
          really listening. On the table beside the piano is a stack of
          picture albums and old yellowed newspaper articles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

          83 EXT/INT BUSH'S SHACK/HEARSE - MORNING 83
          Sitting in the hearse outside of Bush's shack, Buddy watches
          Bush get in the car with his shotgun. There is a big wooden
          box of money on the seat between them. Bush props his shotgun
          against it.

                         BUDDY
          Where to, sir?

                         BUSH
          North.

                         BUDDY
          (starting the hearse)
          How far?

                         BUSH
          Till I say, son.
          Buddy gives him an uneasy look and pulls off down the tree-
          lined path.

          84 EXT. ROAD - DAY 84

          The hearse slips around the narrow road that cuts through
          miles of farm land lying fallow in the winter.

          85 INT. HEARSE - DAY 85

          Buddy looks out at the highway. He is driving slow. Bush is
          leaning against the money, thinking.

                         BUDDY
          How much further now?
          Bush waves him on. Buddy scowls then decides to get serious
          about this. He presses on the accelerator and the hearse
          takes off down the highway.

          86 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 86

          Frank is hopelessly lost in a sea of envelopes. The phone is
          ringing off the hook, there are full sacks around him, and
          some Reporter is trying to take a picture through the front
          window. Frank scowls and lowers the blinds.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          87 EXT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - DAY 87

          Frank is at Mattie's door entranced by the troubled but
          beautiful piano music coming from inside. It stops abruptly
          when he knocks. In seconds, Mattie appears.

                         FRANK
          Hey Mattie.
          He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in.

                         FRANK
          Was that you? It was really..

                         MATTIE
          This is a surprise.

                         FRANK
          Yeah, sorry.
          He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here.
          She waits it out as long as she can, not sure how she feels
          about this adoring look.

                         MATTIE
          Was there something you..?

                         FRANK
          Uh, yeah.. Help!

                         MATTIE
          What?

                         FRANK
          I'm up to my ears with this funeral
          and I thought, you know, we haven't
          had time to talk much lately so
          maybe you'd like to come over and
          rip open envelopes with me and

                         MATTIE
          I'm sorry, I have lessons all
          afternoon. I have to get back in.

                         FRANK
          Oh, okay, I just..

                         MATTIE
          Sorry.
          She slips back inside. Frank stares at the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          88 INT. MATTIE`S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 88

           Mattie leans against the door with her eyes closed. There is
           no student at the piano.

          91 EXT. CHURCH/SOUTHERN ILLINOIS - AFTERNOON 91

          The hearse is parked in front of a beautiful white board
          church.

          91A INT. HEARSE - AFTERNOON 91A

          Close on Bush and Buddy.

                         BUSH
          Don't say nothing.

                         BUDDY
          To who?

                         BUSH
          You can say "hi".
          Bush gets out. Buddy sighs, mimes "Hi" and gets out.

          92 INT. ILLINOIS CHURCH ENTRY - AFTERNOON 92

          Buddy quietly creeps in through the front door, looks back
          over his shoulder, scowls, and enters the church.
          93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93
          sanctuary.
          Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door
          behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window
          at the driveway, and then at Buddy.

                         BUDDY
          Hi.

                         CHARLIE
          Hello.
          Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say. He glances
          at the door but Bush is not coming in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         BUDDY
          Hi.
          Charlie holds out his hand, Buddy shakes it.

                         CHARLIE
          Are you sure you're in the right
          place? Not expecting a funeral.
          Suddenly Bush steps into the church. Charlie squints over
          then stares at Bush with utter disbelief.

                         CHARLIE
          Felix?!

                         BUSH
          Hey, Charlie.
          They shake hands, then hug. Buddy is blown away that Bush
          would hug anyone. Bush looks up at the church rafters.

                         BUSH
          Still standing.

                         CHARLIE
          Yes.
          Charlie give Bush a look then holds out his hand to Buddy
          again.

                         CHARLIE
          Reverend Charlie Jackson.

                         BUDDY
          Hi!

                         BUSH
          That's Buddy Robinson, he don't
          talk much.

                         CHARLIE
          Someone better talk. A ghost pulls
          up in the driveway in a hearse, you
          expect a little bit of a story.

          94 INT. CHURCH - LATER 94

          Bush, Buddy and Charlie, sit in pews near a lovely altar.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         CHARLIE
          My hearing is not what it was. It
          sounded like you said you want me
          to preach at your funeral party
          with you sitting there?

                         BUSH
          Yes, sir.

                         CHARLIE
          (shaking his head)
          You know I've talked to God a lot
          about you over the years and he
          said he broke the mould when he
          made you. Said you were sure
          entertaining to watch but way too
          much trouble.
          Buddy grins.

                         BUSH
          Well.

                         CHARLIE
          What would you want me to say at
          this funeral?

                         BUSH
          Whatever you want to, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE

                         (TO BUDDY)
          Could you give us a minute?
          Buddy starts to get up.

                         BUSH
          Sit still.
          Buddy plops back down.

                         CHARLIE
          What's the matter? You scared to be
          alone with me?

                         BUSH
          He can hear what's said.
          Buddy is surprised again. So is Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
          All right. After you left here..
          did you do the right thing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Felix looks up at the beautifully crafted pulpit.

                         BUSH
          I did.. what I thought was right.

                         CHARLIE
          You confessed? Asked forgiveness?
          Bush looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw.

                         CHARLIE
          Did you tell her, Felix?
          Charlie sighs, leans on his knees, and drops his head.

                         CHARLIE
          You came a long way for nothing
          then.
          Bush's eyes jerk back to Charlie and they are hot.
          Buddy tenses.

                         BUSH
          You self-righteous..

                         CHARLIE
          Don't you dare..

                         BUSH
          I built my own jail and put myself
          in it! And I stayed in it for 40
          goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no
          friends! That's not enough?

                         CHARLIE
          You know it isn't.

                         BUSH
          (tears welling up)
          Well. Why don't you come and say
          that then, Charlie? Hell, say it
          all! I don't care.

                         CHARLIE
          Not on your life.
          The air is so heavy you can't breathe it. Bush suddenly gets
          up and leaves. Buddy starts to follow. Charlie puts his hand
          on him to stay. They sit in silence a moment.

                         CHARLIE
          How much do you know about him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         BUDDY
          Almost nothing, sir. I just work at
          the funeral home.

                         CHARLIE
          Do you know he built this church?

                         BUDDY
          No?!

                         (LOOKING AROUND)
          How's a man like him make something
          like this? I mean, I know he's a
          good carpenter but this is..

                         CHARLIE
          Magic?
          (off Buddy's look)
          Maybe it's the best of him, maybe
          he put his soul into it, I don't
          know.

                         BUDDY
          What ya'll were talking about..
          what did he do? Who was he supposed
          to tell?

                         CHARLIE

                         (THINKS)
          For him and God to know I guess. I
          wish I'd never been put between
          them, that's for sure.

                         (BEAT)
          I will tell you that he showed up
          here half dead. I had just started
           preaching. Over the next 4 years we
           built this.

                          BUDDY
           Are you coming to the funeral?
           Charlie sighs and looks around.

          Can I ask you something?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         BUSH
          Do you have to?

                         BUDDY
          Yes. What are we doing? Since the
          day you came into the funeral home,
          I don't think anything has happened
          that you didn't want to happen. I
          just don't know where it's going.

                         BUSH
          There's a whole lot of things that
          you don't know. Like what a dog
          dreams. You can make up a story
          about him chasing rabbits but you
          don't know if there's rabbits in
          there or not. And he can't tell
          you, can he?

                         BUDDY
          Not unless he's a very special dog.
          They snort together.

                         BUSH
          People don't say what they mean
          either so you don't really know any
          more about them then you do about
          that dog's dream.

                         BUDDY
          But what..?

                         BUSH

                         (LOOKING AWAY)
          That time you left my house I saw
          you stop and look back. You wanted
          to know what could make somebody
          like me.
          (off Buddy's uneasy look)
          Well here you are, son, here you
          are.

          96 INT. FUNERAL HOME - EVENING 9 6

           Frank is putting money into a casket. He checks his watch.

                         FRANK

                         (MUTTERS)
          Where are you..?
          Lighting flashes and the lights suddenly go out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          97 EXT.OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHT 97

          The hearse creeps down the road

          98 INT.HEARSE - NIGHT 9 8

          Buddy looks tired. Bush is sitting up ramrod straight,
          thinking hard about something.

                         BUDDY
          I better stop and tell Frank we're
          back. He's probably had 2 or 3
          hissy fits by now.
          (looks out at the rain)
          Why don't you stay the night at the
          house and I'll take you home in the
          morning?
          The simple kindness seems to short Bush out. Buddy doesn't
          notice, he's still looking ahead.

                         BUSH
          Well, I... I ain't stayed with
          nobody in a.. in a long while.

                         BUDDY
          It's fine if you want to.
          Bush looks as if he might say yes but he NOTICES where the
          car is passing through and..

                         BUSH
          Let me out.

                         BUDDY
          What?

                         BUSH
          Stop the car.
          Bush starts to open the door. Buddy stops abruptly.

                         BUDDY
          You can't walk. It's too far..
          Bush climbs out with his shotgun.

                         BUSH
          Put the money in a casket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         BUDDY
          You might as well get back in, I'll
          follow you all the way.

                         BUSH
          (snaps the gun closed)
          Get the hell out of here, boy!
          Buddy's eyes are defiant. Bush slams the door and walks away,
          crossing over a fence and out into a dark field.

                         BUDDY
          Not responsible. Not responsible.
          Shit.
          He slams the steering wheel.

                         100 OMITTED 100

          101 INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT 101

          Buddy is putting the money into the foot of a casket. A lit
          candelabra sits nearby. There is NOISE, like the muted sound
          of something breaking. Buddy jerks and listens.

                         BUDDY
          Frank? Hello? Mr. Bush?
          He stuffs the money into the casket, grabs the candelabra,
          comes back, seals the lid, and starts into the office.

          102 EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 102

          Under the trees crooked rows of cold ghostly headstones
          glisten in the darkness. An old pocket lighter flares to
          reveal Bush staring at a pot of yellow flowers. He holds the
          lighter to a tombstone and brushes away the debris. It reads:
          MARY LEE STROUP B. 1874 D. 1894. THUNDER rolls.
          Close on Bush's face as rain begins to fall..

                         BUSH
          They keep talking about
          forgiveness.. ask Jesus for
          forgiveness.. I never did nothing
          to Him..

          106 INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT 106

          Frank enters with a flashlight. He sees that his desk and
          files have been ransacked. He rushes into the casket room.
          Several caskets have been thrown to the floor. He goes to the
          one where the money is, finds that it is sealed tight, and
          sighs with relief. Hearing something he whips the light
          around and sees Buddy on the floor.

          107 INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT/LATER 107

           Frank examines a cut and bump on top of Buddy's head by
           flashlight and dabs it gently with a cloth.

                          FRANK
           The cut's not bad but how's the 
           head? 
          He moves his finger across Buddy's eyes.

                         FRANK
          Follow it.
          He looks him over carefully. He's had experience.

                         FRANK
          Dizzy? Double vision? Nauseous? 
          (off Buddy's no) 
          You'll be okay. Did you see who it 
          was?

                         BUDDY
          No. I was putting the money in..
          heard glass breaking.. locked up
          the casket quick and.. boom..

                         FRANK
          You did good.

                         BUDDY
          Doesn't feel good. 

          108 INT. DARROW HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - LATER 108

          Mattie sits beside a fire, knitting a baby blanket by an oil
          lamp. All at once the lights sputter on, the radio lights up,
          warms, and begins to PLAY, as a KNOCK at the door..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          109 INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR/DARROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 109

          Mattie pulls the door open. Bush is standing there soaking
          wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun. She draws back
          reflexively. He looks into her.

                         BUSH
          Please, Ma'am.

          110 INT. DARROW HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 110

          Bush stands with a towel around him, shivering.
          Mattie opens a dresser drawer. Inside the drawer, is the
          carefully arranged tableau of a watch, a ring, a stethoscope,
          and some clothes. She hates to disturb the drawer but pulls
          out a pair of black pants and a white shirt, lays them on the
          bed, and walks out.

          111 INT. DARROW HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 111

          Mattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as Bush
          comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose.
          Still shivering, Bush steps uneasily in front of the fire.
          Mattie hands him the hot mug. He looks uneasily at the yellow
          flowers on the table nearby.

                         BUSH
          Thank you.

                         MATTIE
          What are you doing here?
          Burned through, a log falls in the fire. Bush jerks oddly and
          moves away.

                         BUSH
          Can I sit a minute?
          She stares at him then nods at a chair. She keeps standing
          behind the other chair.
          He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside.

                         BUSH
          You want to know why I have your
          sister's picture on my wall?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         MATTIE
          I'm not stupid, Felix. No, I take
          that back. How long was it going
          on? She was already married when I
          met you. Were you just making up to
          me to get to her?
          Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle.

                         MATTIE
          If you're not going to talk, leave.

                         BUSH
          Can you help who you love?
          Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that
          question many times.

                         BUSH
          I've had 40 years to think about it
           and I still don't know.

                         MATTIE
          I don't know either, so..
          Slowly the gargoyle unfolds. His eyes drill into her.

                         BUSH
          I want to tell you how it was. If
          you don't want me to, I'll go.
          Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around
          and sits down.

                         MATTIE
          Don't lie to me. When did you take
          up with her?

                         BUSH
          I came to see you and she was
          there, hanging clothes on the line
          with your mama.
          Bush stares out the window so hard, Mattie turns to see what
          he is looking at..

                         BUSH
          She turned around..
          (as Mattie turns back)
          .and.. I promise you that I did
          not know that I had a heart till
          right then.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Tears well up in Mattie's eyes.

                         BUSH
          You were a fine fine girl. I didn't
          know why you wanted anything to do
          with me but I was gonna keep coming
          to see you 'till my luck ran out.

                         (BEAT)
          And then I saw her.

                         MATTIE
          She was married! And she wasn't
          just my sister, she was my best
          friend. We told each other
          everything. I can't.. how long did
          it go on?!
          Bush's face is so white it looks like a death mask.

                         MATTIE
          How long?

                         BUSH
          It's still going on, Little Bit.
          Mattie tries to absorb that. The truth and tragedy of it
          touches her in way that she is not prepared for. They sit
          there in silence. She suddenly wipes her face and scowls.

                         MATTIE
          Did you have anything to do with
          her death?
          The mug trembles. She sees it.

                         MATTIE
          Tell me.
          Like a fish jerked from the water, he mouth opens and closes,
          but nothing comes out.

                         MATTIE (CONT'D)
          Felix!
          (off his haunted silence)
          Get out of my house! NOW!
          Bush stands up quickly and starts for the door.

                         MATTIE
          And go to hell!

                         BUSH
          Been there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          He staggers, tries to catch himself but slides down against
          the wall.
          Despite her anger, Mattie starts toward him.

          112 INT. DARROW HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/MOMENTS LATER 112

          Bush sits on the floor, pale as moonlight. Mattie is beside
          him with a stethoscope in her lap.

                         MATTIE
          You need to see a doctor..
          He raises his eyes to her but says nothing. They look into
          each other for a long moment.

                         MATTIE
          Just tell me, Felix. Did you hurt
          Mary or not?
          Bush stares into her then suddenly gets up, picks up his
          shotgun and goes out the door without a word.

          113 INT. FUNERAL HOME/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 113

          Frank is putting the files back in the drawers when he hears
          a NOISE. He reaches into the drawer and turns with a pistol
          in his hand.
          Bush is standing in the doorway with his shotgun.

                         FRANK
          What the hell?!
          Bush glances at the pistol, at the open drawers of the
          cabinet and desk.

                         BUSH
          They get it?

                         FRANK
          No. Buddy sealed it up in a casket.
          Took a crack on the head, but..

                         BUSH
          (cold dark look)
          Is he all right?

                         FRANK
          Yeah.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         BUSH
          You sure?

                         FRANK
          I was an army medic. He'll be fine.
          But Bush is still dark.

                         FRANK
          But you ought to take those clothes
          back and get something in your
          size.

                         BUSH
          They get the whiskey?

          114 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - NIGHT/LATER 114

           Frank sits with his feet on the desk. Bush sits across from
           him. They each have a cup of whiskey.

                         FRANK
          Brought the money back, huh?
          (off Bush's absent nod)
          Listen, I've been thinking.. What
          if we had the party at your place?
          People are going to want to see the
          land they're getting so..

                         BUSH
          Don't know.

                         FRANK
          Well, think about it, we could..

                         BUSH
          Don't know that I'm doing it.

                         FRANK
          What?!

                         BUSH
          Thinking to call it off.

                         FRANK
          You can't!

                         BUSH
          Damn well can if I want to.

                         FRANK
          No no no, it's in motion!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         BUSH
          If I say no, it's no. Send the
          money back.

                         FRANK
          You're killing me! I bought things,
          hired people.. promised money,
          everybody in town is hoping to..

                         BUSH
          I care about this town as much as
          they care about me.

                         FRANK
          It's what you said you wanted and
          I've busted my ass for you. So why
          don't you want it anymore? You owe
          me that.

                         BUSH

                         (LONG BEAT)
          It was the end of the line, tell it
          all, get out of jail party. But I
          guess I ain't got the goddamn guts
          to open my own mouth and I can't
          get nobody to talk for me so the
          hell with it. And to hell with me.
           Bush grabs his shotgun and goes. Frank sits, stunned.

          115 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE-EARLY MORNING 115

          Buddy sits at the breakfast table, holding his son. He opens
          and closes his eyes, checking out his vision. Kathryn, at the
          stove, sees him out of the corner of her eye.

                         KATHRYN
          Are you having trouble seeing? 

                         BUDDY
          I see you're mad.

                         KATHRYN
          I'm not mad. I'm concerned
          She shoves the skillet off the burner and comes to him.

                         BUDDY

                         (SQUINTS UP)
          No, you're mad.
          She tenderly touches his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         KATHRYN
          If I could get my hands on whoever
          did this, you'd see mad.

           FRANK (O.S.)
           Buddy! You up?!
          Frank rushes in, lifts a phantom hat to Kathryn, scrapes up a
          chair, pulls on the baby's toe, and looks at Buddy.

                         FRANK
          Trouble.

                         BUDDY
          What's the matter?

                         FRANK
          Bush is pulling out.

                         BUDDY
          What?

                         FRANK
          What happened yesterday?

                         BUDDY
          I told you, we went up to Illinois
          and met a preacher.

                         FRANK
          But what happened?

                         BUDDY
          He asked the preacher to come to
          the funeral. He said no.

                         FRANK
          Son of a bitch, that's got to be..

                         (TO KATHRYN)
          Sorry.
          (to the baby)
          Sorry. Where's the preacher?

                         BUDDY
          It won't do you any good.

                         FRANK
          Why not?

                         BUDDY
          He knows something about Bush,
          something bad, I think.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         FRANK
          What is it?

                         BUDDY
          Wouldn't say but..

                         FRANK
          Well if Bush wants him, by God,
          Bush is gonna get him.

                         KATHRYN
          (slams the skillet down)
          You want eggs, Frank, or will the
          skillet do?

                         FRANK
          What? What's wrong?

                         KATHRYN
          What's wrong? My husband has his
          head bashed in and all you care
          about is this party!

                         FRANK
          It's not like that, Katie, this is
          for all of us. You're like.. family
          to me.. I..

                         KATHRYN
          This is not how family acts!

                         FRANK
          Well, I'm sorry. I've never had any
          practice.
          (gets up/to Buddy)
          You okay?
          Buddy nods. Frank leaves. Buddy mutters to the baby.. 

                         BUDDY
          Stay out of her way today, partner.

          116 EXT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - MORNING 11 6

          Mattie is on her knees trying to plant bulbs in the hard cold
          ground. Her trowel barely gouges the earth. She stabs it
          again and again into the ground.

                         MATTIE
          Fool, it's too late for bulbs..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Suddenly she hurls the trowel as far as she can, then a
          handful of bulbs.. then her hat.

                         MATTIE
          .too goddamn late..

          117 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - DAY 117

           Buddy is surrounded by bags. He is copying down names onto
           raffle tickets and putting them in bin for the drawing. There
           is a MAN standing guard by the front door with a rifle.

          118 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 118

           Mule stands with his ears back, upset. Bush, back in his old
           clothes, is angrily planing a board. The box of his casket
           minus the lid is on sawhorses behind him.

                         119 OMITTED 119

          120 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE/SOUTHERN ILLINOIS- LATE DAY 120

          A blurred image becomes clear as a magnifying glass lowers
          to a page of a stamp collection book. Fingers fill an empty
          space with a prized addition. A LOUD KNOCKING startles him
          and the stamp is placed slightly crooked..
          Reveal Charlie Jackson scowling at the crooked stamp. He gets
          up, does a double-take out the window. MORE LOUD KNOCKING.

          121 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY 121

          Charlie opens the door, sees Frank standing there. The hearse
          is parked outside.

                         FRANK
          Reverend Jackson?
          (Charlie looks at hearse)
          Frank Quinn, Quinn funeral home.

                         CHARLIE
          How'd you find me?
          Frank just smiles, takes off his hat, and offers his hand.
          Charlie gives him a long look and reluctantly motions him in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Frank enters, noting the clean simple home of man with an
          orderly mind. Charlie motions for Frank to sit down.

                         CHARLIE
          I was going to play some dominos
          this afternoon. But something told
          me to stay home. I should have
          played dominos. Is he out there?

                         FRANK
          Bush? No, sir.

                         CHARLIE
          You sure?

                         FRANK
          Pretty sure.

                         CHARLIE
          Did you check the back?
          Frank snorts, liking Charlie immediately.

                         FRANK
          You told Bush that you wouldn't
          come to the funeral?

                         CHARLIE
          If he got that, why are you here?

                         FRANK
          To help you rethink it.

                         CHARLIE
          I don't need any help.

                         FRANK
          Have you rethought it?
          (off Charlie's look)
          So there is a need.

                         (BEAT)
          First off, Bush doesn't know I'm
          here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         CHARLIE
          I wouldn't be so sure about that.
          (off Frank's look)
          He's got a way of making people do
          what he wants them to.
          Frank squirms, knows it true.

                         CHARLIE
          Is he really a hermit?
          Frank whistles and takes Bush's poster out of his coat.
          Charlie jerks at the picture of the wild man.

                         FRANK 
          He came to see me after he'd been 
          here, wants to call the party off.

                         CHARLIE
          I don't care.

                         FRANK
          Said he'd meant it to be a.. end of
          the line, tell it all, get out of
          jail funeral but that he didn't
          have the guts to open his mouth and
          he couldn't get anybody to talk for
          him. You know anything about that
          part?
          (off Charlie's sigh)
          At first he said he wanted
          everybody to come who had a story
          about him. But he didn't want to
          hear their bullshit stories, did
          he? Pardon my language. He wants to
          tell one, doesn't he?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         CHARLIE
          About time.

                         FRANKFRANK
           Whatever he did, it's been locked
          up in him for 40 years and he can't
          get it out.
          (off Charlie's look)
          I think he told you. You may be the
          only person he told. And now he
          wants you to tell it for him.

                         CHARLIE
          Because he won't.

                         FRANK
          Or can't.

                         CHARLIE
          Or won't.

                         FRANK 
          Or can't. 

                         (BEAT)
          At least he wants the truth to come 
          out, give him that.

                         CHARLIE

                         (LONG STARE)
          I'll think about it.

                         FRANK
          Is there a boarding house around
          here?

                         CHARLIE
          I said I'd think.

                         FRANK
          Yeah but if you're not coming, I'm
          not going back. I made promises I
          can't keep to people I care about.
          This falls apart they won't blame
          Bush. Bank will take my business..
          If I'm gonna have to start over
          again, might as well be from here.
          Charlie scowls at him.

          122 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 122

           Using a tool, Buddy unseals the casket to put the new money
           in it and discovers that the rest of the money is gone? He
           can't believe it. He yanks back the casket bed lining..

                         123 OMITTED 123

          126 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 126

          Bush is sanding the beautiful lid of his casket. It is
          leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all
          over him. He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles
          up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back. It's
          not the weight, something is wrong. Sweat pops out on his
          forehead. He forces himself to the casket and drops the top
          down hard, staggers back against the loft ladder, slides down
          to the ground, and stares at the casket. Is this it?

          127 EXT. CROSS ROADS - DAY 127

          The hearse sits on the side of the road. Road signs give the
          mileage to different destinations.

          127A INT. HEARSE - DAY 127A

          Frank is lying in the back of the hearse, his head propped up
          on an old suitcase. He sips from his flask and stares out the
          window, thinking.

          128 INT. BUSH'S BARN - LATE DAY 128

          Bush is still on the ground propped against the ladder. His
          eyes are closed and the fading light steals across his face
          that is as still as it can be. The sawdust makes him look
          almost wooden. A shadow crosses then comes closer.
          Buddy is sure he is dead but Bush's eyes open.

                         BUDDY
          What are you doing, sir?

                         BUSH
          Getting a suntan.
          Bush starts to get up then falls back against the ladder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         BUDDY
          Are you stuck?

                         BUSH
          You have no goddamn idea how right
          you are, son.
          Buddy moves to help him up but Bush waves him off.

                         BUSH
          I'll sit here a minute.
          Bush looks at the butterfly bandage on Buddy's head.

                         BUSH
          We're a pair, ain't we?

                         BUDDY
          Are you sick?

                         BUSH
          Just going through the motions.

                         BUDDY
          What does that mean?

                         BUSH
          There's Alive and there's Dead.
          And there's a worst place in
          between them that I hope you never
          know nothing about.

                         (DARKENING)
          Do you know who hurt you?

                         BUDDY
          No, sir.

                         BUSH
          Sonsabitches.

                         BUDDY
          It doesn't matter. Listen. Frank
          went somewhere and the raffle money
          is gone.

                         BUSH
          You figure he took off with it?

                         BUDDY
          I don't know. I don't want to think
          that. But the money's not here and
          I don't know where it is. He said
          he'd call and he never did.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          Buddy glances into the shadows and sees the casket looming on
          the sawhorses. He stares at it..

                         BUSH
          Well.. what do you want to do?
          Buddy looks back at Bush.

                         BUDDY
          I don't..
          (realizing just then)
          I want to make this funeral for you
          if you want it.

                         BUSH
          (a long look)
          Hell. Do it if you can.

                         (BEAT)
          I guess for everyone like me,
          there's one like you, son. I about
          forgot that.
          Buddy holds out his hand to help Bush up but Bush forces
          himself up on his own and walks out.

          130 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE/SOUTHERN ILLINOIS - EVENING 130

          Charlie sits at his desk, staring blankly at his crooked
          stamp. Suddenly Fate in the form of Frank Quinn looms at the
          window. Charlie knows he is there but he won't look at him.

          131 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM- DAWN 131

          Buddy, Kathryn, and the baby are sleeping soundly. There is a
          SCRATCHING NOISE. Buddy sits up, grabs a baseball bat and
          falls back asleep. The scratching starts again. He opens his
          eyes, surprised to see the bat in his hand. He hears the
          scratching. He looks around, sees something at the window. He
          slides to the floor, crawls on his knees, and looks out.
          Frank is standing there, scratching on the screen. Behind him
          is Charlie, looking very unhappy about standing in the near
          dark in a small southern town, scratching on a screen.
          Buddy realizes what he is seeing and starts to smile.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

          132 EXT. BUDDY'S HOUSE - DAWN 132

           Frank, Buddy, and Charlie are on the porch, watching the
           world come to life. Charlie looks as if he is hoping for some
           kind of sign from above.

                         BUDDY
          I'm glad you decided to come, sir.

                         CHARLIE
          Free will is not all that it's
          cracked up to be.

                         BUDDY

                         (AT FRANK)
          Did you take the money out of the
          casket?

                         FRANK
          Yeah.

                         BUDDY
          Why didn't you tell me?!

                         FRANK
          I forgot.

                         BUDDY
          You forgot?! Where is it?

                         FRANK
          In the hearse, under the
          floorboards.
          Charlie remembers that Frank said he wasn't coming back and
           gives him a look. Buddy is giving Frank the same look.

                         FRANK
          What? Nobody steals a hearse. Now
          all we got to do is take the
          Reverend here to Bush and..

                         BUDDY
          I forgot to tell you, Mr. Bush
          already said he would do it.

                         FRANK
          You're shittin' me?!
          Charlie gets up and starts walking away..

          Where can I catch a train?

                         FRANK
          You can't leave you just got here.

                         CHARLIE
          Watch and learn.

                         FRANK
          Hold on..

                         CHARLIE
          Where's the station?

          133 EXT - BUSH'S LAND/ROAD - MORNING 133
          A tractor pulling a trailer with a big old honking generator
          on it, a truck loaded with equipment and workers for the big
          event rumbles down a dirt road. The Quinn Funeral home hearse
          completes the unlikely parade.

          134 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - MORNING 134

          Bush, dressed in his new suit, shirt, and shoes is a striking
          figure. The old hermit is gone. He looks into the mirror.

          135 EXT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - MORNING 135

          Horton hold the car door open for Kathryn who is holding the
          baby and looking back puzzled at Mattie's house. Finally she
          sighs and gets into the car.

          135A INT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - MORNING 135A

          Mattie stands staring out the window. She is not going.

          136 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - MORNING 136

          At the top of a wide clearing, a truck with a Circus Ad on
          the door is being set up to become a stage.
          The tractor and truck pull into the clearing and drive to the
          circus truck.
          The hearse pulls in and parks. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie
          climb out of the hearse, look around, and stand frozen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          Trucks and cars are parked everywhere around the big
          clearing! Many PEOPLE have been here all night with fires,
          tents and lean-tos. Many MORE PEOPLE are arriving now.

                         CHARLIE
          Expecting a crowd?
          Frank and Buddy give each other a look.

                         FRANK
          Honestly? We don't have a clue
          about what's going to happen here.

                         SET-UP SEQUENCE:
          The big old honking generator is unloaded. Holes are dug. 10
          foot poles are slid from the truck and huge speaker horns are
          attached. Speaker poles are pulled up and set into holes.
          Frank directs a gang of 6 KIDS who are selling raffle tickets
           making sure they know that he has his eyes on them.
           A BAND arrives on the back of pick-up truck.
           The Generator kicks on belching smoke everywhere. Frank is
           yelling Whoa Whoa! Disaster in the making.

          140 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 140

          Bush stands staring out the checkerboard window. He sees
          Charlie approaching and opens the door for him. Charlie
          climbs the steps, appraises the shack, and stares at Bush.

                         CHARLIE
          Pretty nice jail.
          Charlie enters and looks around the little room.

                         BUSH
          Why did you change your mind?
          Charlie just looks at him, the unspoken words louder than any
          reason he could give.

                         BUSH
          Thank you.

                         CHARLIE
          How do you want to do this?

                         BUSH
          I don't.
          He gets a haunted look that catches Charlie off guard.

                         BUSH
          I'm gonna try and tell it, Charlie,
          I really am. But if I can't get it
          done, would you do it? I want it
          said. Please, sir.
          Charlie sighs from down in his shoes and starts for the door.

                         BUSH
          Tell'em the box is in the barn.

          Carl's truck is half hidden off the road. Carl, Gary and
          THEMAN get out of the truck.

          Carl tucks an old 45 in the back of his pants. Gary and
           Theman grab three gas cans off the truck, give one to Carl, 
          and clamber down a deep gully and start up the other side.
          Tom peeks out from behind the big garbage barrels.

          143 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 143

          The generator is working! And standing on the flat bed truck,
          which is now a stage, an ANNOUNCER introduces a hot blue
          grass group The crowd is huge now and listens as the group
          kicks off a song.
          Behind the stage Frank is collecting money from the boys who
          are selling the raffle tickets, making them turn their
          pockets inside out. The generator makes a strange noise,
          Frank eyeballs it, and it labors on.
          Buddy walks up, nudges Frank, and nods out at the huge crowd.
          Can you believe this?! Charlie walks up and says something
          that we cannot hear.

          144 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 144

          Pacing the cage, Bush peeks out the window.

          You asked for it you old ornery
          sonofabitch, now what are you gonna
          do?

          145 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 145

          Frank, Buddy, and Charlie enter the barn and see Mule hitched
          to the wagon. On the back of the wagon is a simple and
          rustically elegant casket with the initials FB carved into
          the center board. It sobers them all.

          146 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/GULLY - DAY 146

           Carl, Gary, and Theman hide and watch Frank, Buddy and 
          Charlie walk Mule and the wagon away from the barn and down
          the road. Carl eyes Bush's shack and starts for it.

                         GARY
          Hey, hey, where you going? He said
          the woods..

          The bluegrass fiddle player nods to the others to quickly end
          the song. Now we see why. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie have
          brought the wagon with the coffin into the field. Everyone
          quiets, remembering why they are here. They park the wagon
          behind the hearse.
          Frank and Charlie walk toward the stage. Buddy peels away.
          Frank calls after him to come with them to the stage but
          Buddy waves them away. He wants no part of that. He sees
          Kathryn and Horton threading their way through the crowd and
          moves toward them instead.
          Frank and Charlie climb the makeshift stairs up to the stage.
          Charlie sits down on a folding chair while Frank goes to the
          big microphone and stares with satisfaction at the huge
          Depression-era Woodstock crowd.

                         FRANK
          Good afternoon ladies and
          gentlemen. I'm Frank Quinn of Quinn
          Funeral Home. Welcome to the live
          funeral party of Mr. Felix Bush!
          People don't know whether to clap or not. Some do and the
          rest of them pick it up.
          Buddy gets to Kathryn and hugs her and the baby.

                         BUDDY
          Where's Mattie?

                         KATHRYN
          She wouldn't come. I don't..

                         FRANK
          I've done some things in my life,
          but never this. Bet you haven't
          either, bet no one has.

          Frank finds Buddy in the crowd.

          The person who made all of this
          happen for us doesn't like the
          spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the
          heart of Quinn Funeral Home and I'm
          proud to know him.
          Buddy is embarrassed and moved. Kathryn's eyes soften.

           Carl is sloshing gasoline onto the back porch while Gary and
           Theman keep nervous watch at the farendof porch. Suddenly
           Carl feels a shotgun's cold metal on his neck and the 45
           being ripped from his belt and thrown to the ground.

                         BUSH
          Sonsabitches.
          Carl drops his can. The other men drop their cans but Gary
          starts to pull a pistol from his back pocket.

                         BUSH
          Go on, I'll paint the porch with
          his head.

          Don't do it!
          Gary drops the pistol.

                         BUSH
          Now pick up them cans and keep
          pouring.

                         CARL

          Pour it on your head. All of it.
          The men look at each other. Bush cocks the other barrel of
          his shotgun.

                         THEMAN

          The men hoist the cans and start to pour the gasoline over
          them. Burning and spitting they empty the cans. Suddenly
          Theman bolts, moaning and running blind with gas in his eyes. 

                         BUSH
          I got two barrels, anybody else
          wants to rabbit, now's the time.

                         FRANK
          I know many of you have heard
          stories about Mr. Bush. But today
          I've been told that we're going to
          hear another kind of story, his.
          A murmuring moves in a wave across the crowd as they see..
          .Bush enters the field with his shotgun pointed at Carl and
          Gary's backs. They are drenched with gas and it is burning
          them through their clothes.
          Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton see Bush.
          Quinn and Charlie follow the crowd's eyes to Bush.

                         QUINN

          SHERIFF DEPUTIES beside the stage see Bush.
          But everyone remains frozen, not knowing what has happened or
          what to do now. Is this the crazy Bush of the legends?

          Buddy starts toward Bush. Kathryn tries to stop him but he
          pulls free and walks slowly toward Bush.
          A shot rings out!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          Carl and Gary hit the ground like dead men.
          The crowd hunkers and scatters.
          Horton steps in front of Kathryn and the baby. Buddy freezes.
          Charlie rushes up beside Frank at the microphone.
          Carl rolls up and turns to Bush and sees blood seeping out
          onto his shirt beneath his coat.
          Bush whirls and sees..
          .Carl's old 45 still smoking.
          The gun is in Tom's small shaking hands..

                         CARL
          Don't hurt him! It's my fault.

          PLEASE, PLEASE..
          Bush cracks his shotgun, walks slowly to the boy, gently
          takes the 45, empties the shells, and hands the gun back.

                         BUSH
          A second chance is a precious
          thing, son. Don't waste it.
          The boy plops down, overwhelmed.
          And suddenly everyone is in motion.
          The Deputies run toward Bush. Frank and Charlie rush from the
          stage. Kathryn and Horton are going.
          Buddy arrives at Bush first and sees the blood weeping onto
          his shirt.

                         BUDDY
          Are you alright, sir?!
          Without turning Bush glances at the Deputies.

                         BUSH
          Tried to burn me out. Let the boy
          be, he didn't mean nothing.
          As the Deputies get a hold of Carl and Gary, Frank, Charlie,
          Kathryn and Horton arrive. Carl looks at Horton with pleading
          eyes and nods to Tom.

                         CARL
          Help him, Gus, please..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          Horton goes to the trembling boy and picks him up.
          Bush suddenly walks into the trees without looking back.

          153A INT. WCGM RADIO STATION - DAY 153A

          The Announcer hangs up the phone on the wall, rushes to the
          turntable and lifts the tone arm from the record that is
          playing.

                         ANNOUNCER
          Folks, I've just received word of a
          tragic turn of events at the Bush
          Funeral Party. It seems that Mr.
          Bush has been shot. I repeat, Mr.
          Felix Bush has been shot. There is
          no word of condition..

          153B INT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - DAY 153B

          The radio is playing but we don't know where Mattie is.

          ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          When I know more I will let you
          know. I'm sure he would appreciate
          your prayers..

          154 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 154

          Bush stands at the mirror, his shirt unbuttoned and pulled
          back. The bullet caught the muscle just above his clavicle.
          Buddy, Frank and Charlie rush in.

                         BUSH
          Close the door.
          Charlie slams the door. Frank examines the wound. Buddy
          stares in shock at the old roping burns scars on Bush's
          chest.

                         FRANK
          Missed the bone. Got any alcohol
          and clean rags?
          Bush nods at the cabinet. Charlie finds an amazing assortment
          of herbs and roots, alcohol and old sheets ripped into rags.

                         BUDDY
          Why don't you sit down, sir?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         BUSH
          Boil some water and I'll tell you
          how to make me a poultice.
          Frank takes the rags and alcohol from Charlie

                         FRANK
          This is gonna hurt.

                         BUSH
          Don't sugar coat it.

          155 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 155

          Everyone is standing around in shock.

          156 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 156

          Kathryn waits anxiously near the porch with the baby.

          157 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 157

          Horton steps up to the microphone. The shocked crowd turns to
          him. He closes his eyes and bows his head.

                         REVEREND HORTON
          Lord, you say you move in
          mysterious ways and we believe you
          because we don't understand much of
          anything. And so we come to you
          today not seeking answers to what's
          happened here but asking you to
          help us open our hearts a little
          more to each other and find some
          forgiveness and understanding.

          158 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 158

          Frank has cleaned the wound. Buddy has made a poultice that
          Bush is pressing onto the wound as he hears the last of
          Horton's prayer over the loudspeakers.

                         BUS H
          Pretty good prayer. Mighta been
          wrong about that preacher.

                         CHARLIE
          Why don't you lay down, Felix?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          Bush thinks about it, sees a way out. For a second he looks
          like he might take it. Then he shakes his head, puts a rag
          over the poultice and pulls his shirt up.

                         BUSH
          Let's go 'fore I lose my nerve.

                         BUDDY
          Are you sure?
          Bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt. He looks at
          Frank's white shirt. Frank just stares at him. Bush keeps
          looking. Finally Frank sighs and starts loosening his tie.

          159 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 159

          The bluegrass band sings a good hymn. The crowd is still
          stunned and talking, not knowing what to do.

          160 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 160

          Buddy gently helps Bush into his jacket, which has a bullet
          tear in it along the shoulder but Bush seems okay with it, to
          Frank's relief.
          Frank is putting on an old faded shirt of Bush's. As Bush
          starts for the door, he comes up beside Charlie.

                         BUSH
          You ain't nervous? All them white
          folks out there?

                         CHARLIE
          There's white folks here?!

                         BUSH
          Stick with me, you'll be all right.

                         CHARLIE
          You're the one they're shooting at.
          As Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings
          flooding in with the light. He looks at Buddy.

                         BUSH
          Pretty interesting day so far, huh
          boy?
          Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          161 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 161

           Charlie, Bush walk through the murmuring parting crowd toward
           the stage. Frank and Buddy are close behind. Buddy is looking
           for Kathryn. She spots him and moves toward the stage.

          162 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 162

          Bush and Charlie go up the steps to the stage.
          At the last second, Bush stares at the big microphone and
          stops, unable to go on.
          Charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone
          and looks out a the sea of white folks.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm Reverend Charlie Jackson. Felix
          wants to continue with his funeral.
          And he's asked me to say a few
          words.
          Just below the stage, Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn.
          Charlie glances back at Bush, turns inward, searching for the
          words. Finally he holds his hands out, wide apart.

                         CHARLIE
          We like to imagine that good and
          bad, right and wrong, are miles
          apart. But the truth is, very often
          they're..
          (brings his hand together
          and laces his fingers

                         TIGHTLY)
          .all tangled up with each other.
          Bush raises his head and looks at Charlie's back.

                         CHARLIE
          Some 40 years ago Felix Bush
          dropped into my life and then
          dropped out. In between he built
          the most beautiful sanctuary that
          I've ever seen. A lot of wonderful
          things happened in that church.
          Suddenly Bush breaks away, moves up beside Charlie, and puts
          his hand on his shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         BUSH
          Thank you, Charlie. Thank you.
          Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the
          microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing.
          Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath, and walks up
          to it, and looks out over the huge crowd.

                         BUSH
          Had to go clear to Illinois to find
          somebody that had anything good to
          say about me. Hell of a thing.
          His voice booms out over the crowd, startling him. He looks
          down, sees Buddy, Kathryn, Frank and Horton.
          He looks closer for someone most important but she is not
          there. The crowd murmurs. Finally..

                         BUSH
          I'm not a smart man or a wise one.
          I don't know what kind of man I am.
          I was always restless, thought I'd
          see the world. But I didn't hardly
          go nowhere.. on purpose..

                         (BEAT)
          Because.. because I did something
          that I was ashamed of. Something I
          couldn't ever fix.

                         (GLANCES AROUND)
          Ya'll probably think you know what
          you'd do or what you wouldn't. And
          I wish you good luck with that. I
          really do.

                         (BEAT)
          When I told Charlie what I'd done,
          he told me to confess to God and
          the law and to.. to someone else..
          so I could get forgiveness. But I
          didn't want forgiveness.

                         (BEAT)
          I needed to hold on to what I did..
          to be sick from it every day of my
          life. So I never told nobody else.
          He stops, not knowing how to go on. The crowd has quieted
          completely.
          As as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces, he
          suddenly SEES HER coming through the crowd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Mattie's here. Seeing that Felix appears to alright, her face
          changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred.
          The look takes Bush's breath away. But he suddenly seems to
          accept it as his due and when he talks, it is only to her.

                         BUSH
          I fell in love with a married lady.
          And somehow she fell in love with
          me. It was the only time that I
          have been in love.

                         (GATHERS HIMSELF)
          We made a plan to run off and start
          a new life but she didn't show up
          at the time that we said we'd meet.
          I got a funny feeling and I went to
          her house.
          Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush talking
          just to her.

                         BUSH
          Her husband answered the door.

                         (BEAT)
          He had blood on him.
          For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being
          suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized.

                         BUSH
          I hit him pretty hard, knocked him
          down. Can't remember going upstairs
          but I remember I saw a hammer on
          the steps and it had blood and hair
          on it.
          The crowd gasps. Mattie is trembling.

                         BUSH
          I found her in the bedroom. She was
          crawling across the floor.

                         (BEAT)
          But before I could get to her and
          help her up.. a kerosene lamp hit
          the wall. And then her husband
          jumped on my back. Funny what
          happens sometimes when things go
          wrong. It's like the clock stops
          and you have all the time in the
          world to think. I could see that
          her husband had set the downstairs
          on fire before he came up.

                         (BEAT)

          97.

                         BUSH (CONT'D)
          And as I was slamming his head into
          the wall, trying to get shed of
          him, I could see clear as anything
          that it was all my fault. If I'd
          just never spoke to her..

                         (BEAT)
          And as I was thinking about that, I
          saw that the lamp he threw had set
          the room we were in on fire too.
          Bush forces himself to keep looking into Mattie.

                         BUSH
          And then I realized that I was on
          fire. I tried to put myself out but
          I couldn't, everything was..

                         (BEAT)
          I dropped him, turned around and
          saw her lying on the floor and
          called her name. She looked up at
          me..

                         (BEAT)
          .and the next thing I knew, I was
          flying..
          A loud roar of fire and crushing timbers..

          163 EXT. BURNING HOUSE - NIGHT 163

          A man on fire bursts through the second story window of a
          burning house. He lands hard and rolls across the yard to
          smother the flames.
          With his clothes still smoking, he unbelievably tries to run
          back into the hell. But the fire is too hot and he cannot. He
          screams like a mad man and runs into the trees..

          164 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 164

          The crowd is motionless. Nothing is moving. It is as if the
          whole world has stopped. Frank, Buddy, and Kathryn are
          frozen.
          Bush and Mattie are looking into each other, one anguished
          soul to another.

                         BUSH
          I don't know how I got out the
          window.

          98.

                         BUSH (CONT'D)
          No matter how many times I play it
          in my mind, I can't remember
          jumping. I thought I killed him,
          but maybe he pushed me, I don't
          know...
          (lost as ever..)
          I swear to you, if I left her in
          there.. everything I know about
          myself is a lie. But that don't
          matter.

                         (BEAT)
          I didn't get her out, Little Bit, I
          didn't. I'm sorry.

          165 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 165

          Bush sits on the edge his bed. His face is drawn and haunted.
          The door open and closes. He doesn't look up.
          Mattie sits down beside him. Tears are streaming down her
          face. She lays her head gently on his shoulder.

                         MATTIE
          Oh, Felix..
          He sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it.

                         BUSH
          Wonder if her hair would be white?

          166 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - END OF DAY/MONTAGE 166

          A MAN chooses a winning raffle ticket from a wire cage.
          A poor YOUNG COUPLE with SEVERAL CHILDREN win the raffle! The
          promise of a new and better life begins for them.
          The big funeral party breaks up people wind their way home.
          The big old honking generator coughs off.
          Mule is lead back to the barn.
          The equipment is disassembled and loaded back on the truck.
          The microphone stands alone on the stage. He got it said.

          167 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 167

          Buddy, Frank, Horton, Charlie, and Kathryn and the baby wait
          outside, giving Bush and Mattie time. Buddy takes the baby
          and holds it close.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Finally Mattie and Bush come out of the shack and walk down
          to the others. No one knows what to say. Finally..

                         BUDDY
          How you doing, sir?

                         BUSH
          Just fair, son.

                         HORTON
          Carl said Ray paid them to set the
          fire. Paid them to break into the
          funeral home too.

                         FRANK
          Can't stop pulling Aces out of his
          ass, can he?

                         HORTON
          Spend his money on lawyers now. You
          know how thrifty they are.
          Frank motions to Buddy and they go to Bush. Buddy is still
          holding the baby, Bush looks tenderly at Buddy and the baby.

                         BUSH
          What's his name?

                         BUDDY
          Larry, Lawrence, after my dad, sir.

                         BUSH
          He ain't gonna throw rocks at me,
          is he?

                         BUDDY
          Not if knows what's good for him.

                         BUSH
          You boys did good. Real good.
          Let's settle up.

                         BUDDY
          We don't have to do that now. You
          get some rest.

                         FRANK
          (a look/ then)
          Yeah. We'll come out tomorrow.

                         BUSH
          Bring my shirt back, I just got it
          broke in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          Bush pulls Buddy aside. Frank stares over at them but can't
          hear what they are saying. He moves over beside Mattie.

                         FRANK
          Are you alright, Mattie?
          She looks up at Frank for a long moment, her face softening.

                         MATTIE
          Oh, I don't know. I'm still moving,
          I guess..
          He doesn't know what that means but she has finally really
          looked at him and that's something he'll hold onto.
          Kathryn comes and hugs Mattie as.. Bush and Buddy come back.
          Bush goes to Charlie.
          Frank is staring at Buddy, looking for a clue as to what Bush
          said. Buddy gives him nothing,

                         BUSH
          Thanks again for coming, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm proud of you.

                         (MEANING IT)
          Thank you for my church.

                         BUSH
          Did you ever get my bill?

                         HORTON
          Can we get a ride our car's about 2
          miles down the road.
          Everyone piles into the hearse. There is no back seat so they
          all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides.
          It makes everyone smile. Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting
          embrace then climbs in. Bush looks in on them all for a long
          moment all then closes the door.
          As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out
          the back window. Buddy waves back.

                         BUSH

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Look at that. My funeral and
          everybody's in there but me.
          The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful. He looks down the
          road through the fading dust and sees a WOMAN walking slowly
          toward him. He squints, recognizes her, and his face fills
          with a timeless love.

          168 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER 168

          It's a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree. Mule stands
          hitched to the wagon. The three dog grave markers are
          frosted.
          A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the
          tree. It is freshly carved with: Felix Elijah Bush. A pot of
          fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker.
          Bush's beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave.
          Frank, Mattie, Charlie, Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton stand
          beside the grave. Several MEN with shovels wait near the
          tree. Charlie's eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation
          which Bush would probably love.

                         CHARLIE
          Well, Felix, this one's for real, I
          guess. I didn't actually see them
          put you in the box so..
          Charlie glances over and notices "Charlie" on one of the
          dog's grave markers. He snorts and shakes his head.

                         CHARLIE
          Wherever you are, you're probably
          giving someone a hard time or
          something wonderful and priceless
          just to confuse them. Not
          everything can be figured out, nor
          everybody. I wish you peace from
          the burdens of your mind and heart.
          I wish it for us all.
          Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand
          out to catch her should she should stumble. She stares down
          at the FB on the coffin, opens her hand, and lets the picture
          of her sister drift down onto the coffin.

          169 EXT. HILLSIDE - LATER 169

          Everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave. Buddy and
          Kathryn move up beside Frank and Mattie and Charlie. Buddy
          tosses the ball of hermit money to Frank.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         BUDDY
          A 50 on the outside, all ones
          inside. Less than $100.

                         FRANK
          What?!

                         CHARLIE
          I told you. Nobody listens to the
          preacher.
          Buddy pulls some papers from his coat.

                         BUDDY
          The day of the party he told me
          about the will he had in the secret
          drawer of his table. He left the
          raffle money to all of us.
          Everyone is shocked, touched.

                         BUDDY

                         (TO FRANK)
          But you have to pay for Mule's
          upkeep for the rest of his life.
          Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him.

                         BUDDY
          And he set up a fund for the
          upkeep of your church.

                         CHARLIE
          What's the catch?

                         BUDDY
          No catch, sir.

                         CHARLIE
          Still don't get it, do you? With
          Felix, there's always a catch.

                         BUDDY
          Maybe he just knew you'd go crazy
          wondering what it was.
          They all laugh and move down the hillside. As the laughter
          fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has
          had upon them. Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but
          growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the
          pot of yellow flowers. His curiosity about the fearsome old
          man has not abated. Nor will it ever.

     A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of
     railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a
     scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings -

2    INT. CABIN - LAKE SILJAN - DAY                                  2
     An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin -
     a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting
     and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver.

                             MORELL
               What kind is it?

                               VANGER O/S
               I don't know.    White.

                             MORELL
               And the frame?

                               VANGER O/S
               Dark.

                               MORELL
               Postmark?

                             VANGER O/S
               Same as last time.

                               MORELL
               No note.

                               VANGER O/S
               No.

3    INT. VANGER'S STUDY - SAME TIME                                 3

     Henrik Vanger - at 82, even older than Morell - listens
     to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled
     room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan.
                             VANGER
               I can't take it anymore.
                             MORELL O/S
               I know. I'm sorry, Henrik.

     There's nothing more to say. Vanger sets the receiver
     down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame
     resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in.
     It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now
     burst outside -
                                                             2.

4    INT. COURTHOUSE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                             4

     Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of
     reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building.
     As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing
     in his direction. Without stopping -

                             BLOMKVIST
               What is this, the media event of the
               year?
                             REPORTER 1
               Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it
               won't work.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Don't try to play it up, that won't
               either.
4A   EXT. COURTHOUSE - STOCKHOLM - DAY - CONTINUOUS            4A

     Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime,
     which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his
     umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him -

                             REPORTER 2
               Will you appeal?
                             BLOMKVIST
               I'll appeal to you, Viggo:   Find a
               real story to cover.
     He hurries off in the rain.

                             NEWSCASTER V/O
               Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist
               was found guilty today on 16 counts
               of aggravated libel against financier
               Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.

5    INT. CAFE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                                   5

     At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee,
     and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself
     fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV. He's the only
     one there who watches it - no one else is interested -
     which only makes it worse.
                                                            3.
                                                             3.
    

                            TV NEWSCASTER
              In an article published earlier
              this year, Blomkvist claimed
              Wennerstrom - founder and president
              of The Wennerstrom Group - used State
              funds intended for industrial
              development in Poland for an arms
              deal with the right-wing Ustashe in
              Croatia.

    The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the
    courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal
    team, confidently addressing the reporters -

                            WENNERSTROM ON TV
              I have nothing against Mr.
              Blomkvist. He's a good journalist
              who I don't believe is guided by
              malice. But what he wrote was
              inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go
              unanswered. He - all journalists -
              have to accept like the rest of us,
              actions have consequences.

    Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter.
                            BLOMKVIST
              Marlboro Red ... and a lighter.
6   EXT. CAFE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                               6

    He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette.
    Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the
    lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
    Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.

                            TV NEWSCASTER V/O
              Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600
              thousand SKE in damages and all court
              costs, which could be significantly
              more.

    He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful
    feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it,
    finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.

7   EXT. MILLENNIUM OFFICES, STOCKHOLM - DAY - ESTABLISHING       7
8   INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY                               8

    He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly-
    young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man-
    walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the
    editor's office.
                                                          4.

                        ERIKA
          Where you been?

Erika Berger is about Blomkvist's age, and - like the
IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a
mini-skirt.

                          BLOMKVIST
          Walking.    Thinking.

                          ERIKA
          Smoking?

                          BLOMKVIST
          Just one.
He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair.
                        ERIKA
          TV4 called. I told them no
          statement until we've read the
          judgment in its entirety.

                          BLOMKVIST
          I have.    Who else?
                        ERIKA
          Everyone who's ever wanted to see
          you humiliated.
                        BLOMKVIST
          You've been on the phone all day
          then.

          I'm as much to blame for this as you.

                          BLOMKVIST
          You are?    You wrote it?
                          ERIKA
          I read it.    I ran it.

                          BLOMKVIST
          Not the same.
                        ERIKA
          Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.

                          BLOMKVIST
          Mine is.
They regard each other in another silence.      Then -

                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm tired. I feel like climbing
               under a duvet and sleeping for a
               week.
                             ERIKA

     He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'

               I already called Greger and told him
               I wouldn't be home tonight.

     A motorcycle dives down a driveway that burrows under a
     three-story building.

10   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - MILTON SECURITY - DAY            10

     Dragan Armansky, 40's, who looks more like a boss of a
     New Jersey crime family than CEO of a high-tech security
     firm, sits behind his desk, waiting with an older client.

                             ARMANSKY
               It's possible we could wait forever.
                             FRODE
               You called her, I thought.     You spoke
               to her.
                             ARMANSKY
               I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.

                             FRODE
               I don't understand.

                             ARMANSKY
               No one here likes her. So it's
               better if she works at home.
                             FRODE
               But you told her I wanted to meet
               her.

                             ARMANSKY
               But I've told her many more times I
               prefer her not to meet clients.

     The figure from the motorcycle crosses the lobby. From
     behind we can't see him/her well, but can see wary looks
     from others emerging from and getting into the elevator.
                                                               6.

                             FRODE V/O
               But you like her.
                             ARMANSKY V/O
               Very much. She's one of the best
               investigators I have. As you saw
               from her report -

12   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - CONTINUED              12

     The report on Armansky's desk is 200 pages long.

     INSERT: Printed on its cover: Mikael Blomkvist, a case
     number and, smaller, its author, Lisbeth Salander.
                               FRODE
               But.

                             ARMANSKY
               I'm concerned you won't like her.
               She's different.
                               FRODE
               In what way.

                               ARMANSKY
               In every way.

     The black-clad figure - from behind again - strides past
     coworkers who look away.

14   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - CONTINUED              14
                             SECRETARY/INTERCOM
               Ms. Salander's here.

     Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom
     button twice to say `okay, let her in.'

     Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic-
     looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair -
     pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably
     several more under her black leather jacket - black t-
     shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots.

     Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his
     initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This
     is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me.

                             ARMANSKY
               Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode.
                             FRODE
               How do you do?
                                                           7.
                                                            7.
   

She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him:

                        SALANDER
          Something wrong with the report?
                        FRODE
          No. It seems quite thorough.
          There's a wealth of data here. But
          I'm also interested to know what's
          not in it.

                        SALANDER
          There's nothing not in it.

                        FRODE
          Your opinion of him isn't.

                        SALANDER
          I'm not paid to give my opinion.

                        FRODE
          So you don't have one?

Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back
begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually -
                         SALANDER
          He's clean.   In my opinion.

                        FRODE
          He's - excuse me?

                        SALANDER
          He's honest. He's who he presents
          himself to be. In his business,
          that's an asset.

                        FRODE
          There's less in his asset column
          after his conviction today.
                        SALANDER
          That's true. He made a fool of
          himself with that. If it happened
          that way.
Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean?

                        SALANDER
          If he made up the story, that's
          out of character. So is giving up
          without a fight. People don't do
          things that are out of character.

                        FRODE
          Are you saying he was set up?
                                                        8.
                                                         8.


                        SALANDER
          That wasn't part of my assignment.

And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either.
                        FRODE
          You're quite right he made a fool of
          himself professionally. How big of a
          fool did he make of himself
          financially?

                        SALANDER
          The judgement will just about empty
          his savings.
This seems to please Frode more than anything else that
has been said, and Salander sees it.
                        SALANDER
          May I go?

                        FRODE
          Your report is light in another
          area. His personal life. Anything
          you chose not to include?
                        SALANDER
          Nothing that warranted inclusion.

                        FRODE
          I'm not sure if that means yes or no.

                        ARMANSKY
          I think what Ms. Salander means, and
          I agree, is that everyone has a right
          to a certain amount of privacy, even
          when they're being investigated.

                        FRODE
          Not in this case. I have to know
          if there's anything about him I might
          find unsavory - even if she doesn't.

Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and
encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no
more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -
                        SALANDER
          He's had a long sexual relationship
          with his co-editor. It wrecked his
          marriage, but not hers. Her husband
          accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at
          Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.

Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much
simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.
                                                              9.
                                                               9.
      

                              FRODE
                You were right not to include that.

                              SALANDER
                I know.
                              FRODE
                Anything else?
                              SALANDER
                No.

                              FRODE
                Please think before you say no.
                              SALANDER
                I did.
                              FRODE
                I don't want to be surprised by
                something later.

      Salander offers nothing more.

                             FRODE
                So. Nothing else. In the personal
                department. You're sure.

                              SALANDER
                     (pause)
                He likes sandwiches.

      Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed
      snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika -
      in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather
      jacket.

      She wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened
      living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half-
      eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it.

                              ERIKA
                Usually when I wake up in a cold
                bed, it's at home.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Sorry.

                              ERIKA
                What are you doing?

                               ERIKA
                 Saying -

                 You're taking over as publisher.
                 You're sorry for any nuisance
                 Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be
                 reached for comment.

                               ERIKA
                 You're giving up.

                 Just taking a few steps aside.

      Salander sits alone at a table waiting for someone with
      a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a Christmas
      bow, the price tag still on it, a paperback book - My 60
      Memorable Games, by Bobby Fischer. She notices the price
      tag is still on it. Peels it off. Dials a call on her
      cell. Hangs up when it goes to voice mail.

      She knocks on a door. Hears classical music playing
      softly inside, but no one answers. She tries the door.
      It's unlocked. The gift in hand, she pushes it open.

      She comes into an apartment which looks like it could
      belong to a professor. Sees a chess piece on the floor.
      Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess
      table and, next to it, a body.
      The gash on the old man's head could have been caused
      by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to
      it. She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing.
      Calls for an ambulance.

      It's doubtful there's a stranger Christmas gathering
      going on anywhere in the world. Standing around with
      eggnog are:
                                                          11.
                                                          11.
  

Blomkvist; his teenage daughter Pernilla; his sister
Annika and her Italian husband; Erika and her weirdly
understanding artist husband Greger, whose arm is around
her waist; a few other friends (and perhaps lovers).
                        GREGER
          You needed a better attorney.       You
          needed your sister.
                          BLOMKVIST
          She offered.

                          ANNIKA
          He declined.
                          BLOMKVIST
          As she hoped.
                        ANNIKA
          Never a good idea mixing family and
          business.

                        BLOMKVIST
          And I still would have lost.

                        GREGOR
          Did you have ... anything on him.

                          BLOMKVIST
          I had a lot.    It just wasn't any
          good.

                        ERIKA
          It wasn't even about Mikael. It
          was Wennerstrom sending a message to
          the press as a whole - and the FSA:
          Don't ask questions.

Blomkvist's daughter seems concerned for him.
                        BLOMKVIST
          I'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to
          worry about me.

                        PERNILLA
          Mom's worried.
                          BLOMKVIST
          About me?

                        PERNILLA
          About all that money.

     Outside the ICU, Salander sits on the floor like a dog
     who won't leave the spot its master told it to wait. For
     the first time since we've met her, she looks vulnerable.
     The doors swing open. A doctor steps out. Salander gets
     up to hear his report -

                              DOCTOR
                You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
                               SALANDER
                His ward.   He doesn't have a

     The doctor isn't sure then if he should talk to her.

     Not allowed to go inside, she peers through glass at
     Palmgren, who is unaware of her, or the nurse attending
     him, or even himself. A spiderweb of tubes emerge from
     his neck and wrists; oxygen tubes from his nostrils.

                              DOCTOR V/O
                He's had severe cerebral
                hemorrhaging. Either from the
                fall itself, or a stroke that led to
                the fall. His blood pressure is
                still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain
                consciousness, but that's not
                assured. And it's possible, if he
                does, there will be neurological
                damage.

23   INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT              23

     They're around the dinner table now, passing platters
     around. Blomkvist notices his daughter's head is bowed
     in silent prayer.

                                BLOMKVIST
                Nilla?    What are you doing?
                               PERNILLA
                Nothing.

                              BLOMKVIST
                     (pause)
                You're not serious.
                                                       13.
                                                       13.

                        PERNILLA
          I don't want to talk about it since
          I know you won't approve.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Of -
               (she doesn't say)
          Nilla.
                        PERNILLA
          Light of Life.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Light of - what?
               (she doesn't repeat it)
          What is that?

                        PERNILLA
          You think it's all senseless but it
          isn't. It's more natural to believe
          in something than not to.

She begins eating. Blomkvist stares at her, feeling a
little sick. A cell phone rings. No one can tell - as
you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out.
It's Blomkvist's.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Excuse me.
Looking back at his daughter with some concern, he steps
away to take the call.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Hello.
                        FRODE O/S
          Mr. Blomkvist?

                        BLOMKVIST
          Yes.

                        FRODE O/S
          Forgive me for intruding on your
          Christmas. My name is Dirch Frode.
          I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik
          Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of
          (him) -

                        BLOMKVIST
          Of course.
                        FRODE O/S
          He'd like to speak to you about a
          private matter.
                                                               14.
                                                               14.
       

                              BLOMKVIST
                You know, you're calling at an
                awkward time.

                              FRODE O/S
                I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down to
                Christmas dinner myself.
                              BLOMKVIST
                That's not what I mean.

                              FRODE O/S
                You're referring to your recent
                legal trouble. That has provided Mr.
                Vanger with some entertainment.
                               BLOMKVIST
                Excuse me?

                              FRODE O/S
                He doesn't care for Wennerstrom
                either.

      Frode, in his polite, deliberate way, is reeling
      Blomkvist in like a perch.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Have him call me.
                              FRODE O/S
                He'd like to meet in person if that's
                okay. Up north. Hedestad.

                               BLOMKVIST
                No.   Sorry.

                              FRODE O/S
                He's much too old to make a trip to
                Stockholm, Mr. Blomkvist. Please.
                If you'd be so kind as to consider.

      Blomkvist isn't sure what to do, or say.
                              FRODE O/S
                Hedestad is lovely in winter.      Like a
                Christmas card.

23A   INT. METRO - MOVING - STOCKHOLM - MORNING                 23A

      Salander rides a crowded underground train, but feels
      even more cut off from the people around her than usual;
      completely alone.
                                                              15.

24    EXT. NORRLAND COAST - DAY                                 24

      A passenger train, barely visible in a severe snowstorm,
      makes its way north. This is no Christmas card.
24A   INT. SJ TRAIN - MOVING - DAY                             24A

      Blomkvist stares out at the bleak, northern landscape.
25    EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY                       25

      Blomkivist disembarks to find Frode - who he can only
      assume is Frode - beyond a veil of snow, waving to him
      from outside a Mercedes. Unlike Blomkvist, he's dressed
      for this God-awful weather in a fur-collared topcoat.

26    INT/EXT. MERCEDES / HEDESTAD - DAY                        26
      Frode's Mercedes comes across a long bridge linking the
      old industrial town to a rocky island.
                              FRODE
                First time in Hedestad?

                              BLOMKVIST
                And last, I'm sure.
                              FRODE
                It's lovely in the spring.

                              BLOMKVIST
                You said it was lovely in winter.

                              FRODE
                This is unseasonable.

                              BLOMKVIST
                I'll be on the 4:30 train back to
                Stockholm.

                              FRODE
                Unless we get snowed in ... I'm
                joking. You'll be home tonight, if
                that's what you wish.

27    INT/EXT. MERCEDES - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                   27
      The car comes up a long, bare-tree-lined drive, leading
      to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a
      distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man
      who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any
      attention; just someone hunting.

                               VANGER
                Welcome.   Come inside.    It's warm.
                                                               16.
                                                               16.
       

28   INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY                                     28

     It is warm inside. There are fires in the fireplaces.
     And Vanger himself is warm in nature, yet speaks quickly
     as they come through the house -
                             VANGER
               Thank you for coming way out here.
               Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's
               insufficient coat. Would you like to
               freshen up? We'll be having dinner
               later. For now, hot tea is waiting.
               Unless you'd like a drink instead.
               What would you like?

                             FRODE
               Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the
               4:30 train back to Stockholm.

                               VANGER
               What?

                             BLOMKVIST
               I can't stay for dinner.

     Vanger looks thoroughly disappointed.      Or hurt.

                            VANGER
               Oh. I guess I'd better be quick
               then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael,
               this way.
29   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                   29

     Tea service and pastries on a coffee table separate
     Blomkvist from Vanger, whose elderly frame is in danger
     of being swallowed up by a wing-back chair.

                             VANGER
               What do you know about me?
                             BLOMKVIST
               That you used to run one of the
               biggest industrial firms in the
               country.

                              VANGER
               Used to.   That's correct.

     There are framed black and white photographs on a wall -
     factories and trains figuring into all of them.
                                                              17.

                               VANGER
                 My grandfather forged the tracks
                 the 4:30 train will take you home on -
                 and most of the other pre-state-owned
                 rail lines.   We stitched this
                 country together. We made the steel
                 and milled the lumber that built
                 modern Sweden.
                      (pause)
                 You know what our most profitable
                 product now is?
                      (Blomkvist doesn't)
                 Fertilizer.

      Blomkvist imagines he's meant to offer a wistful shrug.
                               VANGER
                 I'm not obsessed with the declining
                 health of the company, but I am with
                 the settling of accounts - and the
                 clock is ticking. I need your help.

                               BLOMKVIST
                 Doing.

                               VANGER
                 Officially, assisting me with my
                 memoirs. But what you'd really be
                 doing is solving a mystery. And
                 you'd do that by doing what you do so
                 well - this recent legal mishap of
                 yours notwithstanding. You'd be
                 investigating thieves, misers,
                 bullies, and malcontents - the most
                 detestable collection of people
                 you'll ever meet ... my family.

      She exhumes an unwashed bowl from a sinkful of dirty
      dishes, fills it with tap water without rinsing it, dumps
      a packet of ramen noodles in, puts it in a microwave.

      She takes a Coke can from an anemically-stocked fridge
      to a desk in her so-called living room, a clutter of full
      ashtrays, fast food wrappers, empty soda cans, paperwork,
      unwashed laundry.

      The only things of any value here are her MacBook and
      several external hard drives.

     She types Dirch Frode in the search window. Clicks on
     the top result which takes her to Frode's bio on Vanger
     Industries' site with its distinctive V.I. logo.

     His official company photo accompanies his profile:
     Uppsala University Law School ... Assistant Counsel,
     Vanger Industries, 1965-1972 ... Head Counsel, 1972-
     present.

     She types in another search - Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
     Clicks on his Wikipedia page, which shows a photo of him
     alongside his bio. She skims it -
     President of the investment firm, Wennerstrom-gruppen ...
     personal wealth of 12 billion dollars (80 billion kronor)
     ... 82-foot yacht, villa on the island of Varmdo ...

     She does a third search, types:
     Wennerstrom+Vanger Industries - and hits the `cached'
     option -

     There are only a couple of results that include both
     terms. She goes to one of them, a body of text of some
     old page with the cached terms highlighted in yellow and
     blue, and reads -

     ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, CPA, Vanger Industries
     Accounting Dept., 1971-1972 ...

     The children of the "thieves, misers, bullies and
     incompetents" play on a beach. A shutter blinks freezing
     a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white -

                             VANGER V/O
               This is Harriet. The granddaughter
               of my brother Richard.

32   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                 32
     The same photograph of Harriet in a photo album Vanger
     shows Blomkvist.
                             VANGER
               Richard, who I may as well start
               with to get it out of the way, was a
               Nazi of the first order - joining the
               Nationalist Socialist Freedom League
               when he was 17.
                                                         19.
                                                         19.
 

A page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young
man in a uniform with a Nazi pin.

                         VANGER
           Isn't it interesting how fascists
           always steal the word freedom.
                (Blomkvist checks his watch)
           The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway,
           Richard died a martyr to the Nazi
           cause in 1940 - missed all the real
           excitement - but not the opportunity
           to regularly beat his wife Margareta
           and their son, Gottfried.

We see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man.

                         VANGER
           Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father -
           was what people used to call a Good-
           Time-Charlie.

                         BLOMKVIST
           They're still called that.
                          VANGER
           Are they?   Okay.
INSERT:   Close on a photo of Gottfried.

                         VANGER
           He was a charmer, a ladies man, a
           drunk. In other words, a born
           salesman - which is what he did for
           the company - traveling around,

           on.

           Someone has to do it.
                        VANGER
           That's right. Anyway, he died in
           1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the
           island.

                         VANGER
           His wife Isabella - who was pretty
           much useless before as a parent -
           became even more so after his death -
           which is when I began looking after
           their children - Martin - who runs
           Vanger Industries now that I'm
           retired - and Harriet.

     A photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet.

                              VANGER
                She was bright and curious, a
                winning combination in any person.
                              BLOMKVIST
                And beautiful.
     Vanger nods as he regards the photo ...

                              BLOMKVIST
                Something happened to her?

     Vanger nods again; is silent for several moments ...
                              VANGER
                Someone in the family murdered
                Harriet and for the last forty years
                has been trying to drive me insane.

                              VANGER
                It was September 21st, 1966.    A
                Saturday. Harriet was 16.

36   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY - 1966                           36

     Three generations of Vangers dot the grounds.

                              VANGER V/O
                My brothers - along with their
                wives, children and grandchildren -
                had gathered here for our loathsome
                annual board meeting and dinner. It
                was also the day the Yacht Club held
                its Autumn parade.

37   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY - 1966                                37

     And we see the parade, and, among the spectators lining
     the town's main street, Harriet with other teenage girls.
                                                             21.
                                                             21.
     

                             VANGER V/O
               Harriet and a couple of school
               friends had gone into town to watch
               it. She returned a little after two
               o'clock.
38   INT. VANGER'S PARLOR - DAY - 1966                         38

     A clock in the room reads, 2:10.    Vanger and a few family
     members sip afternoon cocktails.    Harriet appears.

                             VANGER V/O
               She came to the parlor. She asked
               if she could talk to me. I honestly
               don't remember what I was doing that
               I thought was more important, but I
               told her to give me a few minutes.
     She leaves.   He returns to the others in the room.

                             VANGER V/O
               But in a few minutes, before I could
               go upstairs to talk to her, something
               else occurred.

39   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1966                           39
     A car and a fuel truck, both going too fast, collide on
     the bridge. The truck rolls onto its side crushing the
     car and spewing gasoline.
                             VANGER V/O
               The accident had nothing to do with
               Harriet - and everything.

40   INT. VANGER'S FAMILY ROOM - DAY - 1966                    40

     Vanger and the others react to the noise of the crash.
     Out the large window they can see the bridge and many of
     those on the grounds trotting down to get a closer look.

                             VANGER V/O
               It was chaos as everyone dropped what
               they were doing.

41   EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY - 1966                              41
     People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge.

                             VANGER V/O
               Police, an ambulance, fire brigade,
               reporter, photographer and onlookers
               quickly arrived from town, as those
               of us on the island - the family -
               hurried to the bridge from our side.
                                                              22.
                                                              22.
      

      The truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but
      the other motorist is trapped.

                               VANGER V/O
                 The driver of the car - a Mr.
                 Aronsson - was pinned and severely
                 injured. All we could do was try to
                 pry him out with our hands - since
                 metal tools could spark.

      A local newspaper photographer and another man, snap
      pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry
      the injured driver from his car. As the chaos ensues -

                               VANGER V/O
                 About twenty minutes after the crash,
                 Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna
                 herself saw her.
42    INT. KITCHEN - VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966                  42

      Anna glances to Harriet as she comes in, then back out
      the window to the bridge. Harriet passes a clock that
      reads 2:35, steps outside, walks toward the woods ...

43    EXT. THE BRIDGE - DUSK - 1966                             43
      As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make
      progress extracting the driver from the car. A young man
      coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help.
                               VANGER V/O
                 We finally got poor Aronsson out of
                 his car and off to the hospital, and
                 those of us on our side drifted back
                 to the house.

44    INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                          44

      The family has assembled at a long dining table.

                               VANGER V/O
                 The sun was down, the excitement
                 over, we sat down to dinner. That's
                 when I noticed Harriet wasn't there.

      Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else,
      including the young man from the bridge, his jacket
      draped on his chair, passes platters of food around.

                               VANGER V/O
                 And she wasn't there the next
                 morning. Or the next. Or the next
                 forty years.

45    INT. VANGER'S MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY                 45

      Vanger has the same look of concern on his face now as he
      leads Blomkvist up some stairs.

                              VANGER
                What was she going to tell me? Why
                didn't I make time for her? Why
                didn't I listen?

                              BLOMKVIST
                She couldn't have run away?

                              VANGER
                Not without being seen.

45A   EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT - 1966                           45A
      The crews continue their work under lights.

                              VANGER
                Firemen stayed on the bridge all
                night pumping out the gasoline. And
                no one swam across, or took a row
                boat. All of them were still tied up
                on this side Sunday. Believe me, we
                checked.
45B   INT. VANGER MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY                   45B

                              BLOMKVIST
                She couldn't have fallen and drowned?

                              VANGER
                The currents aren't strong here.
                Anything that falls into the water
                turns up nearby. Like her father.
                His body didn't drift more than ten
                meters when he drowned the year
                before.
      Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his
      labored breathing.

                              VANGER
                No. Someone killed her, Mr.
                Blomkvist. Someone on the island
                that day. Someone close enough to
                know what she used to give me each
                year on my birthday.
      He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to
      reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a
      wall.
                                                             24.

                             VANGER
               These were from her.

     And, on another wall, forty similarly-framed flowers -
                             VANGER
               These, from her killer.
     Blomkvist regards the forty ...

                             BLOMKVIST
               Who knows about these?

                             VANGER
               Me, the police, the murderer ...
               and now you.




46   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DUSK                                     46
     It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before
     a luxurious apartment building. Salander approaches from
     the other direction. Passing, she notes the four number
     tones the woman keys in the code lock.

     The door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside.
     Salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones
     in the Milton Security lock.
47   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STOCKHOLM - CONTINUOUS          47

     Opulent foyer. Security camera. Antique elevator cage
     whose cables pull the woman upstairs. Salander comes to
     an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement
     machine room. Examines tangles of phone lines, meters,
     Wi-Fi routers. Photographs them with a digital camera.
     She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer. The front
     door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes
     it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass.

     The man is a driver/bodyguard. He continues to hold the
     door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an
     idling car and crosses to it in the rain ... Wennerstrom.

                             VANGER V/O
               When the police investigation petered
               out, I kept at it -
                                                            25.

49   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT                                49

     They're eating dinner now in the dining room.

                             VANGER
               - studying their reports and
               interviews, all the information there
               was, and it's a lot. I've spent half
               my life examining the events of a
               single day.
     And for all that, he's no closer to the truth.

                             BLOMKVIST
               I understand your frustration.
               But what you're asking me to do is
               a waste of money.
                             VANGER
               We haven't discussed your fee.
                             BLOMKVIST
               We don't need to. I can't find
               something you haven't been able to
               in forty years.

                             VANGER
               You don't know that. You have a
               very keen investigative mind.

     Blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as
     Vanger refills his wine glass.
                             VANGER
               Here's what I propose: You come
               stay on the island. I have a nice
               little cottage by the water you can
               use. You study the material I give
               you. You find something I've missed
               - or you don't.

                             BLOMKVIST
               You want me to set aside my life
               and career for something that's a
               complete waste of time.

                             VANGER
               Think of it as a well deserved
               vacation. A way of avoiding all the
               people you want to avoid right now.
                    (nothing from Blomkvist)
               As for compensation, I'll pay you
               twice your salary for as many months
               as it takes. I'll quadruple it if
               you solve the mystery.
                                                             26.
                                                             26.
     

                              BLOMKVIST
                Mr. (Vanger) -

                              VANGER
                I'm not done. I'll throw in one
                more thing - even though you're a
                terrible negotiator. It's what you
                want more than anything else and it
                can't be bought at any price. I'll
                give it to you ... Hans-Erik
                Wennerstrom.

      He pushes toward Blomkvist a plate: the carcass of the
      fresh-killed and cooked duck they've been eating. It and
      the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a
      moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed.
                              VANGER
                He began his career working for me.
                And I've followed it with interest,
                shall we say, ever since. You were
                right about him. You just couldn't
                prove it.

      Salander climbs a flight of stairs in a building that
      couldn't be more different than Wennerstrom's. Knocks
      on a door, waits, listens to some dead-bolts unlocking.

      It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing
      over 300 pounds. He offers her no greeting. Fades back
      into the shadows of his dark apartment.

                Would you like to sit? I could
                possibly clear a place if necessary.

      It's hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish
      that. The place is like a junkyard. Even the unmade bed
      is covered with stuff.

      She takes some cash from a pocket, hands it to him.    He
      counts it and is unimpressed with its total.

                I'm on welfare; I don't administer

                I had to pay three months back rent
                and eat a little bit. It's all I
                have right now.
                              PLAGUE
                I find that so poignant.
      So much so that he does nothing more than look at her.
      She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and
      moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end
      computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives
      her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over
      in her hands.

      While it's clear both these people are deficient in
      behavior that governs polite society, it's hard to tell
      which lacks it more.

51    INT. MILLENNIUM OFFICE - EARLY MORNING                    51

      Erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks,
      comes through the empty offices with a Wayne's Coffee to-
      go cup - but Blomkvist is already there, packing supplies
      from his desk, books from his shelf. A second suitcase,
      presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor.
                              ERIKA V/O
                You can't be serious -

51A   INT/EXT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - EARLY MORNING - LATER    51A
      He zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and
      gathers the rest.

                              ERIKA
                We're in our worst crisis ever and
                you're writing a memoir?
                              BLOMKVIST
                You fired me; I need something to do.
                              ERIKA
                You fired you; I need you here, not
                the North Pole. You know what this
                is going to look like.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Like I've been gutted. Like I'm
                running away. I am.
      They cross through the building, he with his cases, she
      with her coffee cup.
                                                            28.
                                                            28.
    

                             BLOMKVIST
               Wennerstrom wants to see me waving
               a white flag, not a red one. And the
               more it looks like there's a problem
               between you and me, the more it'll
               satisfy him.

                             ERIKA
               There is a problem between us. He
               won't be satisfied until he shuts us
               down, and you're leaving me to fight
               him alone.

     He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a
     statue - and steps outside.
                             BLOMKVIST
               It's four hours by train.   It's not
               the North Pole.
52   EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY                      52
     The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with
     two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him.
     He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi
     stand.
53   INT. TAXI - MOVING - DAY                                 53

     As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist
     regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him
     in the rear view mirror.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Think this snow's going to let up
               anytime soon?

                             HUSSEIN
               This is the North Pole.

54   EXT. COTTAGE - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                       54

     The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here
     he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The
     taxi drives off and disappears into the snow.
55   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                       55
     Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would
     call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold.

     Blomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out
     books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and
     a small printer.
                                                               29.
                                                               29.
       

     He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no
     reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces
     it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands
     a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads
     straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him.
                                BLOMKVIST
               What.   Milk?

     He opens the old fridge.    No milk.    Nothing.
56   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                          56

     He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone
     out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water.
     Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't.
57   INT. MARKET - HEDESTAD - DUSK                               57

     He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some
     packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food.
58   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        58

     He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow,
     cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again.
     Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever
     - there are no cell towers anywhere around here.

59   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        59

     Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he
     can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the
     end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.

                             BLOMKVIST
               It's me. I'm here. It's fucking
               cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you
               tried to call, the reception sucks,
               and if you tried to email, there's
               none of that either, so - so - I'm
               here - and - I can't even speak it's
               so fucking cold.

     He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from
     before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in
     the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge.

60   INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                        60

     As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to
     get a fire going using pages ripped from a book. It's a
     struggle he's going to lose; he's no Boy Scout.
                                                             30.
                                                             30.
     

61   EXT. WENNERSTROM'S BUILDING - NIGHT                       61

     Salander appears and keys in the four lock tones.
62   INT. WENNERSTROM'S BUILDING - NIGHT                       62
     In the machine room again, she pulls one cable away from
     the others and wires to it to Plague's electronic box.
63   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN                                      63

     The bell in the church tower clangs -

64   INT. COTTAGE - DAWN                                       64

     But it's a knock that draws Blomkvist awake. Having
     forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with
     him, then the room, and groans. He pads to the door in
     the freezing cold. Opens it to find a rugged older man
     on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.

                              NILSSON
               I'm Gunner.   The caretaker.
65   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAWN                               65

     As Gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for
     him, Blomkvist works at unpacking the boxes - documents,
     fat police reports, notebooks, folders, photo albums.

                             NILSSON
               You're an author.
                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm writing a biography of Mr.
               Vanger, yes.

     Nilsson nods, but isn't sure he believes it. Maybe he
     took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down.
                             NILSSON
               I saw you on television.
                             BLOMKVIST
               That's unfortunate.

                             NILSSON
               Bit of trouble, I guess.

     Blomkvist nods and hopes that's enough to put an end to
     the subject. It isn't.

                             NILSSON
               No jail time, though. That's good.
               Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?
                                                             31.
                                                             31.
    

     Blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat. Nilsson
     dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made.

                                NILSSON
               There.
66   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY                                  66

     Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around
     the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold
     grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old
     man, is inadequately dressed.

                             VANGER
               The island is owned by my family.
               Your closest neighbor is my brother
               Harald, another Nazi if you can
               believe. Two in the family. He's
               detestable to put it nicely, but
               you'll probably never see him. He's
               a recluse.

                             BLOMKVIST
               He was there that day?

                             VANGER
               Indeed he was.

     Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a
     suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -
                             VANGER
               That's his daughter Cecilia's house.
               They don't speak.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Does anyone speak to anyone on this
               island?

                             VANGER
               Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother
               - who lives there -
                    (points)
               - she speaks to Harald - which is one
               of reasons I don't speak to her.
                    (points)
               Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Who doesn't he speak to?
                             VANGER
               You, probably. Not that you'd want
               him to. He can be as unpleasant as
               Harald.
                                                        32.
                                                        32.


                        BLOMKVIST
          I'm quickly losing track who's who.

                        VANGER
          Oh, how you'll wish were it always
          so. Soon you'll know us all only too
          well - with my apologies.
               (points)
          Out there is my nephew Martin's
          house; Harriet's brother.

It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Who speaks to him?
                        VANGER
          I speak to him. He runs the company
          now, as I think I told you.

They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.     It startles
Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.

                        VANGER
          Someone shooting their dinner.
          Gunner probably. The caretaker.
                        BLOMKVIST
          I just met him.
                        VANGER
          He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.

Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a
suspect. Vanger points off -
                        VANGER
          He lives over there.

Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
                        BLOMKVIST
          And you live here.

                        VANGER
          Sorry?
                        BLOMKVIST
          Your house.

For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means.
Then he is, and is pleased by it.
                                                                    33.
                                                                    33.
     

                              VANGER
                Yes, you're right. The man who
                hires the detective should always be
                kept on the suspects list.

67    INT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 67

      A nurse takes a tray away, leaving Salander alone with
      Palmgren, separated by the chess table they won't playing
      a game on. She wipes his mouth with her sleeve.

                              SALANDER
                I got a call from social welfare.
                I've been assigned a new guardian.

      It's unlikely he understands what she has said.        It's
      unlikely he even knows she's there.

68    INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            68
      Tacked to a wall, a map of the island on which Blomkvist
      has written the names of the living Vanger family members
      and staff in the approximate locations of their houses.
      Next to it - 3x5 cards and photos - a Vanger family tree -
      which doubles as a suspects list. On some of the cards
      is the word, `deceased.'
      He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins
      reading the police reports. The first is a photocopy
      of a note when the call from Vanger came in: "Officer
      Morell informed by telephone of situation, 10:19 p.m."

69    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT - 1966                               69

      Gustaf Morell stands at the bow of a patrol boat slowly
      motoring past the bridge where the fire brigade works to
      pump the gasoline from the overturned truck.

      INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Morell on site, Hedeby
      Island, 11:42 p.m."

70    INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                                70
      Morell, feeling like he's entered an Agatha Christie
      locked room mystery, regards the extended Vanger clan
      sitting in the living room looking suitably worried.

                              MORELL
                I'd like to see the girl's room.

                It's down the hall.

                             MORELL
               I thought this was your house.

                               VANGER
               It is.    She lives with me.
                             MORELL
               Are her parents alive?
                             VANGER
               Her mother is.

     Vanger points Isabella out. Slender, overdressed and
     smoking a Sobranie, she immediately strikes Morell as a
     woman as venomous as she is beautiful.
                              VANGER
               This way.
     Morell follows Vanger down a hall -

     missing girl's bedroom. Found - "

     A purse on the desk in Harriet's room. Morell carefully
     removes the contents: Comb, pocket mirror, handkerchief,
     wallet containing a few kronor, her ID, and her address
     book. He leafs through this.
                             DET. MORELL
               I want to speak to everyone here.
               That'll take all night so you might
               want someone to put some coffee on.

                             YOUNGER VANGER
               What about the search?

                             MORELL
               First thing in the morning.
                             YOUNGER VANGER
               No. We should do it now. She could
               be hurt out there.

     Vanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide.
                              VANGER
               Please.   I beg you.

                 Eventually, much to his dismay - and
                 mine - I had to talk to Henrik about
                 calling it off -

      As the search continues, Morell, looking like he hasn't
      slept - which he hasn't - peers down a rocky cliff to the
      water. Somehow he knows they're never going to find her.

                               MORELL V/O
                 The fact that I never found a body
                 didn't surprise me. You can't dig

      The same face - forty years older - the man who spoke to
      Vanger on the phone about the dried flowers - now speaks
      with Blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of his pipe.

                          MORELL
          But   I also couldn't find a motive.
          Was   it spontaneous? Was it planned?
          Did   she know something someone wished
          she   didn't? Was it about business?
                         BLOMKVIST
          Business?   She was sixteen.
                        MORELL
          And very bright. Henrik told me he
          could easily imagine her running the
          business someday, which would mean
          someone else wouldn't.


                        BLOMKVIST
          She was with some friends that day.
          At a parade. You must have talked to
          them.

                        MORELL
          She told them she wasn't feeling
          well. She left early. But they also
          said she kept secrets from them, too.
          The main thing I learned talking to
          them for hours is that teenage girls
          are complicated.
                         BLOMKVIST
          I have one.

                        MORELL
          So you know.
               (Blomkvist does indeed)
          Did you bring the last gift Henrik
          received?

                        BLOMKVIST
          It's at the National Forensic Lab.

                        MORELL
          I can tell you what their report
          will say now: It's a flower common
          to Europe. All of them are. No
          prints. No DNA.
He lights the pipe.   Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I wanted to ask you about this.

He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket.
Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it
delicately. The decades have dried out its pages.
                                                       37.

                        MORELL
          She received this from Henrik the
          Christmas before. I studied it more
          times than I can say. I know every
          page of it.
                        BLOMKVIST
          It's the last page I'm curious about.
                        MORELL
          As was I.

                        BLOMKVIST
          The only names not alphabetized.
Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns
to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting:
Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018

                        MORELL
          They're local Hedestad phone numbers.
          The first belonged to a woman named
          Margot, whose mother was Magda, who
          claimed she didn't know Harriet. The
          fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie
          Larsson, an elderly woman who died a
          few years before. The other three
          were unconnected in any way that I
          could find.
He hands the address book back. It, and everything else
about the case, clearly trouble him still.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I've reminded you of things you'd
          rather forget. I'm sorry.

                        MORELL
          I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka
          Case.

Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.

                        MORELL
          Every policeman has at least one
          unsolved case. Back then it was old
          Torstensson. Year after year he kept
          returning to one - taking out the
          files - uselessly studying them. As
          young men, we had to laugh.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Was this also a missing girl case?
                                                             38.
                                                             38.
    

                             MORELL
               No, that's not why I mention it.
               The Rebecka Case is something that
               happened before Harriet was born.
               I'm talking about the soul of a
               policeman. Poor Torstensson could
               never solve it, and could never let
               it go.
     And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case.

79   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - DAY                               79

     As a man behind a desk reviews   a thick file, Salander
     reviews him: About 50; spends    money on suits, thinking
     that might disguise his public   servant status; no wedding
     ring; typical creep, as far as   she's concerned.

                             BJURMAN
               How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was
               told he had a stroke of some kind.
                    (nothing from Salander)
               Terrible.

     It is, but she can tell he couldn't care less.     He leafs
     through her file -
                             BJURMAN
               What exactly do you do at this
               security company?

                             SALANDER
               Make coffee and sort mail.

                             BJURMAN
               But not full-time. Not even part-
               time consistently. They somehow got
               along without coffee or mail in July
               and August?

     Nothing from her.
                             BJURMAN
               How much do you earn there?

                             SALANDER
               Enough.

                             BJURMAN
               How much is your rent?
                                                       39.

                        SALANDER
          I pay my rent.

                        BJURMAN
          When's the last time you were late?
                        SALANDER
          Never.
                        BJURMAN
          Do you think that ring in your eyelid
          makes you attractive?

Salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all
her life, doesn't dignify the question with an answer.
                        BJURMAN
          Here's the problem. There a
          discrepancy between the obligation of
          Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the
          management of your finances.

                        SALANDER
          It isn't a discrepancy or a problem.
          It was clear to him I could manage my
          own finances.
                        BJURMAN
          But that's not clear to me.
                        SALANDER
          I'm not a child.

                         BJURMAN
          No.  You're not.
                (looks at her too long)
          But you were. And between then and
          now -
                (indicating the files)
          - two years in the locked ward at
          St. Stephens, for violent aggression -
          failure to adapt to four foster homes
          and seven schools - arrested twice
          for intoxication, twice for narcotics
          use, and most recently for assault:
          a bottle smashed into a man's face.
          You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into
          thinking you've improved, but looking
          at this -
                (the file)
          - not to mention how you're looking
          at me now - I can see you haven't.
          So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are
          over. Starting now, you'll be given
          a monthly allowance. You'll provide

                have to assume the difference is
                going to drugs.

                              SALANDER
                I've been on my own since I was
                twelve.
                              BJURMAN
                No. You've been a persistent burden
                to the State since you were twelve.

      She won't look at him any more - not that there's
      anything even remotely interesting to see if she did.
                              BJURMAN (CONT'D)
                Ms. Salander? Please look at me.
                Because this is important.
      She does ... in a way that says, I'd like to kill you.

                              BJURMAN
                This behavior you're displaying
                right now is elaborately documented
                here -
                     (in the file)
                - so it would come as a shock to no
                one if I chose an alternative to the
                lenient arrangement I just outlined.
                Is that what you're saying with your

     Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand.
82   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                               82

     The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern.
     Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has
     prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere.
                             LIV
               I used to work in the company's
               petrochemical division in Goteborg.
               When it was sold, I went with it.
                             MARTIN
               A dark day.

                             LIV
               I live in Hong Kong now, but come
               back to Stockholm for family events,
               and when I do, I drive up to spend a
               couple days with Martin.
                             MARTIN
               She comes for the moose steak.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Is that what this is?

     They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange,
     wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine
     in Blomkvist's glass and gets up.
                             MARTIN
               Something's open. You like this one,
               or would you like to try something
               else?

                             BLOMKVIST
               That one's good.

     Martin heads off to the kitchen. Blomkvist and Liv,
     left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about.
                             LIV
               I saw you on Sky News a while ago.
                                                             42.
                                                             42.
  

                        BLOMKVIST
          That was a dark day.

                        LIV
          Sorry to remind you of it.
                        BLOMKVIST
          It's okay. There are worse things
          than libel - though I can't
          immediately think of one in my
          business.

                        LIV
          You're writing a book now, Martin
          said.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Henrik's biography.
                        LIV
          I love Henrik. He's fascinating.
          Martin, too. Together they're the
          Old Sweden and the New.

                          BLOMKVIST
          They are.
                        LIV
          You know about Harriet, right?

Blomkvist doesn't say.    The sound of the wind stops.
                          LIV
          You don't?

                          BLOMKVIST
          I do.

Martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in
hand and returns with it to the dining room.
                        LIV O/S
          The family doesn't like to talk about
          it, but it can't just be swept under
          the rug.

                          MARTIN
          What can't.

                          LIV
          Harriet.

Martin doesn't comment.    Just nods.    Silence.   Then -
                                                       43.
                                                       43.
                       Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

                        BLOMKVIST
          Maybe we could talk about that
          later.

                        MARTIN
          We can talk about it now.
               (Blomkvist glances to Liv)
          Liv knows everything about my crazy
          family. Which is why she'll never
          marry me.

                        LIV
          That's one reason.

She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it.
The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not
unlike Blomkvist and Erika.
                        MARTIN
          Don't put that in your book.
          Anything else is fine. Harriet
          certainly. Everything changed after
          that. Not just the family, but the
          company.

                        BLOMKVIST
          How so.

                        MARTIN
          We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but
          we're still the largest family-owned
          company in the country. At the
          height, we had 40,000 employees. We
          have about half that now, and that
          downward slide - anyone can tell you -
          began after my sister's death. It
          broke Henrik's entrepreneurial
          spirit, and his heart.

And Martin's, too, clearly.    Blomkvist dares to ask, as
innocently as possible -

                        BLOMKVIST
          You were here that day?

                        MARTIN
          Everyone was here, though I didn't
          get in until after the accident on
          the bridge. The 4:30 train.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I know it well.
                                                              44.
                                                              44.
      

                             MARTIN
               It was a terrible day. And the days
               after - searching and not finding her
               - were even worse.
     Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.

                             MARTIN
               This event, Mikael, has to be a
               big part of your book.

     Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will.
83   INT. STOCKHOLM METRO - DAY                                 83

     As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a
     subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of
     her messenger bag from her shoulder -
     She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the
     junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down,
     but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the
     escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto
     the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now.

     She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the
     junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He
     wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator
     and disappears into the underground station.
84   INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                     84

     Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of
     Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks,
     a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ...

     A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top
     of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find
     a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch.
                            CECILIA
               Hi. I thought I'd come over and say
               hello. I'm Cecilia.

85   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                         85
     Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the
     wall. Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post-
     It next to it that reads: Recent Photo?
     INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager,
     and a Post-It with her name on it.

                             CECILIA
               We're all uncomfortable with the
               idea of a chronicle of our family.
                                                          45.
                                                          45.
  

                         BLOMKVIST
           It's not about the family. It's
           about Henrik and the company.

                          CECILIA
           Like I said.

                         BLOMKVIST
           It's not my intention to present a
           malicious portrait of anyone.

                         CECILIA
           Unlike the one that landed you in
           court.
                         BLOMKVIST
           Unlike that one. Correct.
                         CECILIA
           So, what you're saying is, you're
           not really here to look into what
           happened to Harriet.

Silence.   Then -

                         BLOMKVIST
           I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
           but no, that's not by any means my
           focus.
                         CECILIA
           So all those boxes Gunner carted
           down here - which are where? - in the
           closet now? - weren't Henrik's
           private investigation.
                (Blomkvist can't think fast
                 enough to respond)
           I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my
           Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.
INSERT of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform
on the wall.

                         BLOMKVIST
           Since we're talking about it, since
           you brought it up, what was Harriet
           like?

                         CECILIA
           I'm sure Henrik has told you.
                         BLOMKVIST
           He was my age then, and so couldn't
           know what was really going on with a
           teenager any more than I can with my
           own daughter. You were her age.
                                                             46.
                                                             46.
     

                           CECILIA
             Actually, my sister Anita was closer
             to her in age.

INSERT of the photo on the wall of Anita, taken when she
was about 17 years old.

                           CECILIA
             She knew Harriet better than anyone -
             certainly better than I did. You
             should talk to her.

                           BLOMKVIST
             I'd love to, where is she.
                           CECILIA
             If I had to guess - London.
                           BLOMKVIST
             You don't know where your own sister
             lives?

                           CECILIA
             I haven't seen her in years.       We
             never really got along.
                           BLOMKVIST
             I'm getting used to that comment.

                           CECILIA
             That's the way it is when you're
             always after the same boys.

                           BLOMKVIST
             People generally get over that sort
             of thing at a certain point.

                           CECILIA
             Oh, I'm long over it, and won't
             ever have to worry about it again.
             She hates this place even more than
             I do. She left, moved to London and
             that was it. You couldn't pay her to
             send a Christmas card, much less
             visit.
                           BLOMKVIST
             I'll try to track her down for you.

                             CECILIA
             Don't bother.
                           BLOMKVIST
             For myself then.

He smiles.    She studies him.      Maybe he's not so bad.
                                                               47.
                                                               47.
       

                             CECILIA
               If you do, and try talking to her
               about us, don't be surprised if she
               tells you to fuck off.

               It'll take five minutes.      It's
               important.

                               SECRETARY V/O
               Hold, please.
     Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they
     always do. The secretary comes back on.

88   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT                    88

     Salander comes past a janitor waxing a long, otherwise
     empty corridor. At the far end, she opens her new
     guardian's office door.

89   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                               89
     As Bjurman reviews a McJesus invoice, Salander waits.
     The thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she
     has sat in with school principals, shrinks and cops.

                             BJURMAN
               Have you ever had an STD?
                    (nothing from her)

          How many partners have you had in the
          last month?
               (nothing)
          How many were men?
That last one seems to amuse him; none amuse her.
                        BJURMAN
          I'm required to ask you these things.
          It's a matter of health.

                        SALANDER
          Write down anything you want.
Bjurman sighs. Sets the form aside and looks at the
McJesus invoice again.
                        BJURMAN
          Why do you need such an expensive
          computer?

                        SALANDER
          For work.

                        BJURMAN
          Making coffee and sorting mail.

                        SALANDER
          I shouldn't even have to ask. I
          should have control of my money like
          before.

                        BJURMAN
          And you will. Once you show me you
          can be sociable and get along with
          people. Can you do that?
               (nothing from her)
          Shall we start with me?
               (pause)
          Shall we start now?

As he comes around the desk, she eyes a sharp letter
opener sticking out above some pens in a coffee mug a
child has painted with the word, `daddy.'

          If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to
          you. That's how normal people are.

He stands in front of her, his crotch at her eye level.
                        BJURMAN
          You've done this before.   You know
          what to do.

                                                              49.
      
                             BJURMAN (CONT'D)
                    (she doesn't do anything)
               Do you want this computer or not?

     He takes her hand and places it on the crotch of his
     trousers.
                             BJURMAN
               You feel that? That's gaberdine.
               Unzip them.
                    (she does)
               And ...
                    (she tugs at his underwear)
               And ...
                    (she doesn't move; he smiles)
               I like the reticence. I prefer a
               whore who pretends she isn't. It's
               almost convincing.
     He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him.
90   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT                      90
     Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private
     bathroom. When she returns to the office, she finds him
     calmly writing a check.
                              BJURMAN
               Here you go.   As promised.

     He holds it out to her, but when she reaches for it,
     pulls it back a little.

                             BJURMAN
               I know you're not thinking about
               telling anyone about our date. Enjoy
               your computer games.
     She takes the check and leaves.

91   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                  91

     She sits cross-legged in the dark. Thinking. Or
     plotting. The dragon tattoo visible on her bare back.

92   INT. AIRLINE - IN FLIGHT - DAY                             92
     Blomkvist, who doesn't care for flying, pours two mini-
     bottles of vodka into a plastic cup.
93   EXT. LONDON - DAY                                          93

     He sprays Binaca in his mouth. Then, careful to look
     both ways, crosses the street to an investment bank.
                                                               50.
                                                               50.
      

94   INT. OFFICE - INVESTMENT BANK - DAY                         94

     Blomkvist approaches a desk.       The brass name plate on it
     reads, Anita Vanger.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Excuse me. I'm sure I should have
               made an appointment.

                               ANITA
               It's fine.    Please.     Have a seat.

     The accent is all British. She's been here much longer
     than her home country. No trace of Swedish anymore. He
     offers his hand -

                                BLOMKVIST
               I'm Mikael.

                              ANITA
               Mikael.   How do you do.

     As he sits, she regards him a little more carefully ...

                             ANITA
               You're looking for investment
               counseling, Mikael?
                             BLOMKVIST
               I would if had any money to invest.

                                ANITA
               Excuse me?

                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm writing a biography of your
               uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.
     She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia
     predicted, but it doesn't come.
95   EXT. CAFE - LONDON - DAY                                    95

     They sit together at a little table on the sidewalk.
                             ANITA
               How is Henrik?
                              BLOMKVIST
               Good.   Engaging. I like him.

     She does, too.
                                             51.
                                             51.
             Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

              ANITA
I haven't seen him in over 30 years.
Or my sister. Or anyone else in my
family.
              BLOMKVIST
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that, so your recollections
are valid.

              ANITA
I wouldn't know where to start, if
that was a question.

              BLOMKVIST
I can narrow it. I've gotten up to
the 1960s. To the event that altered
everything in Henrik's life.
              ANITA
Harriet.
     (he nods)
Everything I knew about that I told
to - whatever his name was - that
policeman - when it happened.
             BLOMKVIST
Morell.

              ANITA
My recollections then were a lot
better than they are now.

              BLOMKVIST
I'm not speaking of the crime itself.
I'm trying to get a clearer sense of
what Harriet was like. Particularly,
toward the end.

              ANITA
She was messed up. Like all us
Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken
father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi
like mine.

              BLOMKVIST
Was he abusive?

             ANITA
Mine?
             BLOMKVIST
Hers.
                                                            52.
                                                            52.
    

                             ANITA
               I never saw it myself, but you could
               tell something was going on. One day
               she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd
               be putting on makeup and wearing the
               tightest sweater she had to school.
               The next she'd be studying a Bible
               like a nun - no Vanger was ever
               religious - can you imagine?
               Obviously, she was very unhappy.

                             BLOMKVIST
               She never confided in you what about,
               specifically?
                             ANITA
               There was no specifically. It was
               everything. It was being part of
               that family. Henrik's the only
               decent person in it.

                             BLOMKVIST
               What do you think happened to her?

                             ANITA
               Everyone knows what.
                             BLOMKVIST
               But you have no ... thoughts about
               why, or who.
                             ANITA
               All I know is I always felt sorry
               for her. Even more than for myself.
               I got out of there when I was 18 and
               never went back. She would have done
               the same but didn't make it to 18.
96   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                     96

     Salander, on a park bench, debates with herself if she
     wants to make the call on the cell in her hand. She
     scrolls to "NB" and hits send. It connects.
                             SALANDER
               Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth
               Salander.
                    (the call is put through)
               ... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed
               our appointment. I had a lot of work
               ... no, nothing to be concerned about
               ... I need another advance on my
               allowance. Can I come to your office
               tonight? ... I don't need a pen,
               what's the address?
                                                                 53.
                                                                 53.
         

97    EXT/INT. HEDEBY ISLAND - TAXI - MOVING - DUSK                97

      The taxi that first brought him here to the island,
      crosses the bridge. Again, Blomkvist regards the Middle
      Eastern driver, who regards him in the rearview mirror.
98    EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                    98

      Outside the building's entrance with a backpack slung
      over her shoulder, Salander presses an apartment button.
      As she waits, she notes there's no security camera.

                                 BJURMAN O/S
                   Yes?

                                 SALANDER
                   It's me.

      The door buzzes.     She pushes it open.
99    INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                    99
      She moves along a hallway with both purpose and dread.
      Knocks on his door ... It opens, revealing him in a robe.
                                 BJURMAN
                   Come on in.

100   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                       100

      She takes in the layout quickly: living room, dining
      area, kitchen, short hallway to a closed door.

                                 BJURMAN
                   Like it?

                                 SALANDER
                   It's nice.

                                 BJURMAN
                   It's home.
                        (pause)
                   So, what do you need money for this
                   time? Grand Theft Auto 5?

                                 SALANDER
                   Food.
      He smiles.    Steps toward her.    Lifts her chin.
                                BJURMAN
                   How are you? Been thinking about
                   last time? Decided you wanted to see
                   me again?
                                                                54.
                                                                54.
       

                               SALANDER
                 I just want my money.

                               BJURMAN
                 Well, let's see if I can help you out
                 with that.

       He walks to the hallway. She doesn't. He holds out
       his hand. She finally joins him. As they step into the
       bedroom, he roughly pushes her toward the bed.

                               SALANDER
                 Wait.

       She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair.
       Sits on the edge of the bed. He stands over her. She
       knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to.
                               BJURMAN
                 Is there a problem?

                               SALANDER
                 I just want to know, am I going to
                 have to do this every time I need
                 money to eat?
                               BJURMAN
                 It's so cute when you do that surly
                 thing. Take my hand
       She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's
       a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other
       to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out.
       He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into
       unconsciousness.
100A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                 100A

       She comes to, on her stomach, sees her wrists cuffed to
       the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts
       with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off. She
       starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her
       underwear.
                                BJURMAN
                 Please.   I have neighbors.

       He lights a couple candles.   Switches on some New Age
       music.

                               BJURMAN
                 What we're going to do now is teach
                 you the value of money.

       He watches her struggle. But she's not going anywhere.
       He tears open a condom package with his teeth.
                                                                 55.
                                                                 55.
         

                               BJURMAN
                 I forget - did I ask you before if
                 you liked anal sex?

       He crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top
       of her. She keeps fighting but there's not much she can
       do handcuffed. Eventually, she retreats to another place
       inside herself. She's had to go here before in her life;
       it's the only place to go in such situations.

101    INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                       101

       The cat turns its head to a sound Blomkvist can't hear.
       He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at
       photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks
       up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet
       Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews:

                               HARRIET V/O
                 Faith is the assurance of things
                 hoped for, the evidence of things not
                 seen. Through faith we understand
                 that the world was created by the
                 word of God - and that what is seen
                 was not made of things that are
                 visible ...

       He sets it down. Rubs his eyes. Everything - his
       daughter, his life, this cabin, the word of God - is
       depressing.
101A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN                           101A
       Dawn light outside the living room window.

       Bjurman, at his dining table with a glass of orange
       juice, writing out a check.

       In the bedroom, Salander slips on her leather jacket,
       shoulders her backpack, hobbles out to the living room.
                               BJURMAN
                 I'll drive you home.
                               SALANDER
                 I can get home on my own.

                                 BJURMAN
                 Are you sure?

       It's bizarre: his manner seems to be one of genuine
       concern. She nods. He hands her the check. Then opens
       the door for her like a perfect gentleman.

                               BJURMAN
                 So, next Saturday, here?
                                                               56.
                                                               56.
       

      She nods.   Leaves.   The door closes.

102   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAWN                                     102

      A lone figure hobbles through the empty streets.
103   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAWN                          103

      She sets a check down. On the memo line he's neatly
      written, "for food." She takes a bottle of water from
      the fridge and drinks.

104   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAWN                          104

      Shower water hits the dragon tattoo on her shoulder
      blade and runs down past several others. By the time the
      water reaches the drain it has turned red.
105   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                                  105

      Coming through trees with a bag of groceries, Blomkvist
      sees a BMW parked outside his cottage.

106   EXT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                        106

      Blomkvist taps on the car's fogged-up driver's window.
      A hand inside wipes at it, revealing Erika. She lowers
      it a crack.

                                ERIKA
                  Is it any warmer inside?
                                 BLOMKVIST
                  No.

107   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                        107

      As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going,
      using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps
      herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with
      the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  What have I missed besides you?
                                ERIKA
                  The steady exodus of two-thirds of
                  our advertisers.

                                 BLOMKVIST
                  Seriously?

                                ERIKA
                  Is that hard to believe? Sitting up
                  here in Lappland with your cat?
                                                                57.
                                                                57.
        

                               BLOMKVIST
                I'm not.   I'm working.

                                ERIKA
                I can see.
      What she can see is the Vanger research covering the
      walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the
      family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Would you like to meet him?

                              ERIKA
                Maybe in about an hour.      If you're
                interested.

      He is.
108   INT. VANGER MANOR - EVENING                                108

      Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat
      with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her.

                              VANGER
                I apologize if you're having
                financial problems at the magazine
                in Mikael's absence.
                              ERIKA
                We'll work through them.
                                VANGER
                Are you sure?

      Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them
      about this.

                              MARTIN
                How long do you think you can hang
                on? Six months or so?
                              ERIKA
                That sounds about right.

                              VANGER
                     (cheerfully)
                You know, I used to be in the
                newspaper business. We owned six
                dailies back in the 50's.
                              MARTIN
                We still own one. The Courier, here
                in town.
                                                          58.
                                                          58.
  

                         VANGER
           I let my nephew Birger run it since
           he can't run anything else.

Erika nods politely.
                         MARTIN
           So what do you say to taking on a
           partner?

                         ERIKA
           We've never considered it before.
           We value our independence.

                         MARTIN
           Your independence is dependant on
           advertisers - if we're being honest.
           However much you think that is, you'd
           retain. We don't care about content.

Blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a
party.

                          BLOMKVIST
           Excuse me.   Did I miss something?
                         VANGER
           We're talking about an investment in
           the magazine.
                           BLOMKVIST
           I gather.    Why would you want to do
           that?

                         MARTIN
           Not for the return, that's for sure.

                         VANGER
                (to Erika)
           I feel bad that I've take Mikael
           away from you at the worst possible
           time. This is the right thing to do.
           The moral thing. That's one reason.

                          ERIKA
           And.
                         VANGER
           The enemies of my friends are my
           enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much
           as you hate what he's done to you.
Silence.

                         VANGER
           So what do you say?
                                                                 59.
                                                                 59.
         

      Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it.

                                VANGER
                  Is that a maybe?
      She nods.

                                 VANGER
                  Wonderful!   More wine, Anna.

      Blomkvist looks at Erika, but she glances away to Vanger.



                                VANGER
                  I think Mikael is adapting well to
                  rustic life, by the way.
                                ERIKA
                  Have you seen him try to make a fire?

                                VANGER
                  Put the logs on end, like this.

      He makes a teepee shape with his hands, like praying.
109   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT                                109

      Erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  How long have you been discussing
                  this with them?
                                ERIKA
                  I haven't been. They asked me to
                  come up yesterday.

                                BLOMKVIST
                  Why didn't you tell me?
                                 ERIKA
                  Why would I.   You live in the woods.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  So I deserve to be treated like an
                  idiot?

                                ERIKA
                  I wanted to hear what they had to
                  say. You would've said no before
                  they could.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  I'm saying it now. It's not a good
                  idea.
                                                             60.
                                                             60.
     

                              ERIKA
                You heard me tell them we could
                hang on for six months. I was lying.
                Without their money we'll be out of
                business in three.
                              BLOMKVIST
                You don't know this family.   They're
                crazy.

                              ERIKA
                We're not marrying into it.

                              BLOMKVIST
                We are if we do this. It's exactly
                what we're doing.

                              ERIKA
                You want to say no? Let's say no.
                Instead of 50 percent of something,
                let's own 100 percent of nothing.

      The logs crackle as flames climb them. She gets up,
      comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears
      into the bedroom. He stares at the fire.
                                 ERIKA O/S
                Mikael?

                                 BLOMKVIST
                What.

                              ERIKA O/S
                I'm leaving this God-forsaken island
                in the morning.
                                 BLOMKVIST
                So?

                              ERIKA
                So are you coming to bed or not.

110   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY                                110

      Salander regards a selection of forearm tattoos: barbed
      wire, Celtic bands, strings of leaves and flowers.
                              TATTOO ARTIST
                You thinking one arm or both?
                              SALANDER
                Wrists and ankles. But none of
                these. Just a plain band, like
                handcuffs.
                                                               61.

                              TATTOO ARTIST
                It's sensitive there. Particularly
                the ankles. It's gonna hurt.

      That doesn't bother her in the least. She rolls up her
      sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun.

                              SALANDER
                How much do one of those cost?

                Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger
                Industries has acquired a controlling
                interest in Millennium magazine which
                according to analysts has been in
                financial trouble since last December
                when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist
                was found guilty of libel against
                Hans-Erik Wennerstrom -
111   INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY                           111

      A news crew has crammed itself inside Erika's office,
      where a reporter interviews her -

                              ERIKA
                We made a serious mistake last year,
                and we regret it. But we're moving
                forward, and this is the first step.

                              REPORTER 2
                You wouldn't say the first step was
                your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist?

                              ERIKA
                That's inaccurate. Read the original
                press release, Viggo. I didn't fire
                him. He's on sabbatical.
                               REPORTER 2
                Where.

                              ERIKA
                I'm not sure, to be honest with you.

112   INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                    112

      He's at his desk, the cat in his lap, reviewing the
      album of photos taken on the day Harriet disappeared.
                                                                62.

      They're arranged chronologically, and Vanger has noted
      the approximate time of day of each.

      The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by
      family members of each other. The next couple taken in
      town of the parade. Then dozens taken on and around the
      bridge of the dramatic accident. He hears the sound and
      glances out to see a television news van driving toward
      Vanger's manor -
113   EXT. VANGER MANOR - DAY                                    113

      A crew is set up in the yard by the water, interviewing
      Henrik and Martin. Under his suit jacket Henrik wears a
      cheerful yellow shirt. Birger unhappily looks on.

                              MARTIN
                Millennium is an excellent magazine.
                We also think it's undervalued right
                now, which is good business for us.

                              REPORTER 3
                Is any magazine really undervalued
                today. How many will be around
                tomorrow?

                              VANGER
                There's another reason.      I don't like
                bullies.
                              REPORTER 3
                Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
                              VANGER
                I'm referring to anyone who tries
                to sue their enemies into submission.
                If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try
                it again, he'll find himself fighting
                a company that can afford to fight
                back.

                years.

      As a clerk rings up the   items Salander is buying -
      bright yellow duct tape   and a plastic protective mask -
      she watches a shot on a   TV here of Wennerstrom being
      interviewed outside his   offices -
                                                                63.

                              WENNERSTROM ON TV
                I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
                He's a titan - and a gentleman. But
                he's also quite old now - which may
                explain how he could be taken in by
                a convicted liar.

      The report segues to another story.     The clerk hands
      Salander her receipt.
115   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER                          115

      Her hardware store purchases, along with some fresh DVD-
      R's, a couple of plastic bottles of ink, and McDonald's
      Kids Meal wrappers, sit by her laptop.

      She's not typing on its keyboard, but characters are
      appearing nonetheless as someone somewhere else, writes
      an email:
      The From box reads:   h wennerstrom 

      The To box reads:   l jansson 116 INT. COTTAGE - DAY - CONTINUED 116 Blomkvist has returned to the accident photos. Pauses on a blurry one of the fire crew, the focus inadvertently on the background - Vanger's manor. What caught his attention is a figure in one of the upstairs windows. He checks a scribbled floor plan of the manor and sees that it's Harriet's bedroom. But he's not sure if it's Harriet. The figure is too soft to identify - even with a magnifying glass - but is wearing a light-colored dress and has light hair. He glances to the family tree on the wall - the teenage Vanger girls' photos - Three INSERTS: Harriet ... Cecelia ... Anita ... They all have light hair, and, frankly, all look alike. He moves on to the parade pictures. To the one Vanger said before was the last picture taken of Harriet alive. It's not really of her. 64. 64. It's a wide shot of the parade itself - but she can be seen in the background across the street with her friends, watching a float - atop which some women in harem outfits dance - pass by. He slips it from its corner-fasteners and turns it over. There's a Hedestad Courier copyright printed on the back. He turns it over again and looks at the photo itself. 117 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY 117 Guided by the photo, he walks along the town's main street to the approximate place from which it was taken - outside a haberdashery window - but it's still not right. The photo was shot from a higher than street level angle. He looks to a second story window above the store. Then crosses the street to where Harriet was standing when the picture was taken. Looks back at the haberdashery where, now, the owner peers out at him. 118 EXT. HEDESTAD - LATER - DAY 118 On the pay phone outside the gas station - BLOMKVIST I want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade. VANGER V/O You already have what it has. In the album. BLOMKVIST I don't think so. VANGER V/O Why. BLOMKVIST Because no photographer at any newspaper in the world takes just two photos of anything - especially after having to climb a flight of stairs. VANGER V/O The bridge accident happened during the parade. He rushed over. BLOMKVIST Maybe. Silence. Then - VANGER V/O Mikael, what have you found? 65. 65. BLOMKVIST Nothing probably. But I know photographers. They're the most insecure people on earth. If it's out of focus, or they don't like the framing, they bury it. A119 EXT. HEDESTAD COURIER - ESTABLISHING A119 119 INT. HEDESTAD COURIER - DAY 119 Blomkvist follows the paper's youngish photo editor up narrow stairs to an attic. PHOTO EDITOR The current archive is on CD's, naturally. The older stuff, still negatives. What general period are you interested in? BLOMKVIST September, 1966. She glances back at him. The date means something to her, but she chooses not to comment. 120 INT. COURIER ATTIC - DAY 120 She pulls four thick binders off a shelf from September 1966 alone, proving Blomkvist's point about photographers - and piles them up next to a light-box and scanner. BLOMKVIST Thank you. He waits for her to leave. She seems reluctant to ... PHOTO EDITOR Is this about Harriet Vanger? BLOMKVIST You're too young to know about that. PHOTO EDITOR Everyone here grows up knowing about her. It's how we're taught about strangers. 121 INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 121 The door opens revealing Salander. Bjurman seems a little surprised to see her at his doorstep. BJURMAN My dear Lisbeth, how are you? 66. 66. SALANDER I need more money. I need to pay my rent. She looks like a schoolgirl with her little backpack over her shoulder. How did he ever get so lucky? BJURMAN Come on in. She steps inside. He takes her hand and leads her toward the bedroom. Her other hand slips into her jacket pocket. BJURMAN Since we're still figuring out what you like, I went shopping for some new toys. SALANDER Me, too. BJURMAN You, too? What did you buy? She pulls a Taser from her pocket and jams it under his chin, firing off 75,000 volts - 122 EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 122 Set down on the rugged landscape under an almost moonless night sky, the cottage looks vulnerable. 123 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 123 The cat, curled up on a chair, jerks its head up at a sound neither we nor Blomkvist can hear, and stays absolutely still, listening. Blomkvist scrolls through the Courier negatives he has converted into positives and has loaded into Photoshop. He was right. Many more parade pictures were shot that day. Several at street level - a marching band, floats, children with balloons, some in better focus than others. He reaches the first of the higher-angle shots from the floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the street. Harriet isn't in it. But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends. In the next, she's further into frame. And the next, standing in the same spot he stood earlier today. 124 OMIT - INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT 124 67. 67. 125 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 125 Blomkvist selects all 18 of the high-angle parade photographs, transfers them to an iPhoto file, and reopens them as a `slide show.' The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet in G, dissolve at two-second intervals. Too long. Too distracting with the music. And too wide. He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time- interval to make the transitions as quick as possible. He hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent film'- a kind of electronic flip-book: Harriet arrives with her friends. Moves along the street. Stops and faces the parade. Says something to her friends. Laughs. Watches the float with the harem girls on it. Smiles. Sees something to her left. Turns her head slightly toward it. Her eyes widen in fear. She looks down. She moves off. Her friends look after her confused. And then she's gone. Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years: She was murdered. Whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her. The cat watches him. 126 INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 126 Bjurman slowly comes to. SALANDER Good. You're alive. It takes him a moment to realize it's true. Another to realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked on the floor, face-up, wrists and ankles bound. He tries to cry out and realizes he's also gagged. She emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some kind of ghoulish raccoon. She looks insane. As she steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle against the restraints. SALANDER Recognize this? He cranes his neck to see she's by her backpack that's resting on a chair. 68. 68. SALANDER I had it with me last time. I set it here. Remember? (he doesn't) See this snap? It's not a snap. It's a wide-angle micro-lens. She takes a DVD-R from the backpack, puts it in his player, flips his plasma TV on with a remote. She got it all - what he did to her - the rape - in HD. SALANDER This shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl. If it's ever seen outside this room, who'll be institutionalized then? He starts to whimper. SALANDER Here's what's going to happen. Pay attention. He can't. He can't even look at her. His life is over. He weeps into the gag. SALANDER Look at me. He won't. She strides to her backpack. Takes out a large dildo. Gets on her knees, and works it into his ass. She can only get it about halfway up. She has to stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot. He howls into the gag. SALANDER Do I have your attention now? She does indeed. He vigorously nods his head, now, and after everything she says - SALANDER When you can walk again, which I admit could be a while, we're going to my bank. You'll tell them I alone have access to my account. After that, you'll never contact me again. Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have. You'll describe how well I'm doing, how sociable I'm becoming. Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus. (he stares in horror) (MORE) 69. 69. SALANDER (CONT'D) If something happens to me - if I get hit by a car - if you hit me with a car - same thing, it uploads automatically. She fishes his apartment keys from his trousers. Shows him that she has them. SALANDER I'm taking these with me. I'll be checking on you. If I ever find anyone in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not - His eyes dart to the TV as he nods that he understands. SALANDER No. Not the video. She kicks him. Then straddles his fat gut and looks him in the eye. SALANDER I will kill you. And he knows she means it. SALANDER Do you doubt anything I've said? (he shakes his head no) Do you doubt what's in the reports about me? What do they say when you sum them up? They say I'm insane. (he shakes his head no) No, it okay. You can nod because it's true. I am insane. She gets up off him, rummages through her backpack again. SALANDER I know it'll be hard for you to abide by my rules. Especially no more sex. I'm going to make it easier for you. She puts on a plastic surgical mask. He fears the next thing he'll see is a pair of scissors in her hand, but it isn't. It's something else he doesn't recognize. She straddles him again. He squirms under her weight. SALANDER Lie still. I've never done this before. 70. 70. He sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device, a shiny stripped-down gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would go. SALANDER There will be some blood. He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless. She digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth. He screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask ... A127 EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN - ESTABLISHING A127 127 INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN 127 The job has taken her all night. The sky outside the living room window is beginning to lighten. She drinks a glass of water in the kitchen, wipes her prints from it. She crosses to the bedroom where Bjurman's toys have been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser. Picks up her backpack. Looks at him. He's unconscious. She sets handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach. We stay on the key as she leaves the room. Hearing the front door open and close, we rise up to see his entire naked body on the bed. Tattooed into his skin in big letters, from his nipples to his groin, is: I AM A RAPIST PIG 128 OMIT: EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN 128 129 OMIT: INT. COTTAGE - DAWN 129 129A EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY 129A Returning from a walk and a smoke, Blomkvist sees - sitting outside the cottage, petting his cat - Harriet. Of course it can't be her, but it is a teenage girl who resembles the old pictures of her. Seeing him, she waves. It's his daughter. PERNILLA Hi. BLOMKVIST Hi. What are you doing here? PERNILLA On my way to Skelleftea. I can only stay a couple hours. He arrives and gives her a hug. 71. 71. BLOMKVIST What's in Skelleftea? PERNILLA Light of Life Bible Camp. Blomkvist tries to hide his dismay. 129B INT. COTTAGE - DAY 129B He's made them some coffee, and, of course, sandwiches. Patiently waits for her to finish her silent prayer, and smiles bravely. PERNILLA They're not dangerous. BLOMKVIST It's fine, Nilla. Whatever you want to do is fine. Everybody needs something. PERNILLA Just so long as it's not God. BLOMKVIST I didn't say that. As they eat in silence, Blomkvist can't help but think about Harriet and what Vanger said about not giving her his attention when she needed it. BLOMKVIST I'm not around enough to know everything that's going on with you, and I apologize for that. But I'd never want you to not tell me something, even if you think I might not want to hear it. PERNILLA (smiles) That's what I'm doing. 129C EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY 129C The afternoon train is boarding. It's not crowded. BLOMKVIST It should have been me visiting you. I'm sorry. PERNILLA It's okay. Everything's good. 72. 72. He nods but doesn't believe it any more than she believes he's okay with Bible Camp. She climbs aboard. Waves. PERNILLA Bye. BLOMKVIST Bye. The train begins to move. PERNILLA Don't go too hard on the Catholics. BLOMKVIST What? PERNILLA The article you're writing. BLOMKVIST What are you talking (about) - PERNILLA The Bible quotes on your desk. BLOMKVIST What? The train clears the platform. He watches after it. What was she talking about? He glances absently to the taxi stand. Hussein points to his taxi. Ride? 130 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAY 130 Blomkvist comes in, goes straight to his desk, sifts through the paperwork on it, then sees the Xerox of the last page of Harriet's address book - the unknown phone numbers - he taped to the lamp - Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018 It could be a coincidence they're Bible names - Magdalene, Sarah, Mary - or maybe not. He digs through Harriet's personal things for her Bible. Since all the number sequences begin with `3,' he goes to the third chapter - Leviticus - notices that its first facing page is faintly dog-eared - finds R.J's verse - 1:14 - on it: HARRIET V/O If a dove is the sinner's offering, the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings, and burn it upon the altar. 73. 73. 131 EXT. COTTAGE - DAY 131 Pinching a cigarette in a shaking hand, Blomkvist pokes numbers on his cell phone. Instead of ringing he hears a beep. "Retry?" appears on the cell screen. 132 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY 132 Back across the bridge by the gas station, he makes the call on the pay phone. BLOMKVIST Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist. MORELL O/S How are you? Not still in Hedestad I hope for your sake. BLOMKVIST The Rebecka Case you mentioned. What was her last name if you recall. MORELL O/S Of course I do, but what would it have to do with anything? BLOMKVIST Nothing probably. As Blomkvist glances to the last page in Harriet's address book, to R.J. 30114 - MORELL O/S Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson. BLOMKVIST How was she killed? MORELL O/S Decapitated. Arms cut off. Burned. Like the Leviticus dove. A siren. Ambulance coming past, headed for the bridge. MORELL O/S But this happened in the 1940's - BLOMKVIST Hang on a second. He watches the ambulance speed across the bridge. 74. 74. BLOMKVIST I'm going to call you back. MORELL O/S What have you (found) - Blomkvist hangs up and takes off at a trot toward the bridge - 133 EXT. VANGER MANOR - LATER 133 He reaches the manor just as the ambulance is leaving and Martin is climbing into his Range Rover. He looks undone. BLOMKVIST What's happened? MARTIN We were talking. He started rubbing at his arm. Then collapsed. BLOMKVIST Is he (conscious) - MARTIN I can't talk, Mikael, I have to (go) - BLOMKVIST Go. Martin pulls out to follow the ambulance to the hospital. Blomkvist watches after them. 134 INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 134 The cat naps while Blomkvist looks up the other Leviticus quotes from Harriet's list in her dog-eared Bible - HARRIET V/O The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father, and shall be burned with fire - HARRIET V/O A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning - There's a knock. He tucks the list in the Bible, sets aside and answers the door. Frode comes in. FRODE The good news is he survived. How he does now, we have to see. He's in ICU. Can I have one of those? 75. 75. He points to the table. BLOMKVIST A sandwich? FRODE A Scotch. Blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself. BLOMKVIST I don't want to be indelicate. But Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this. FRODE Wennerstrom. BLOMKVIST (nods) I need to know what he has on him. Now. In case. FRODE In case he dies? That is indelicate. BLOMKVIST And I apologize. FRODE I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me. And he can't tell you in the condition he's in. So ... is that it then? Silence. Blomkvist drinks. Eventually - BLOMKVIST We also never discussed who I'd report to if something happened to him. FRODE You'd report to me, but does it matter? We both know nothing's going to come of this. BLOMKVIST I'm not so sure. Frode looks at Blomkvist a little more intently. FRODE What do you mean? 76. 76. BLOMKVIST I may have found something. FRODE (pause) You're joking. (Blomkvist isn't) What did you find? Now it's Blomkvist who studies Frode. He's not sure he wants to tell him. And even less so the longer he looks. BLOMKVIST The last time I reported something before I was sure of it, it cost me my savings. Frode studies him again - wondering perhaps if Blomkvist suspects him. BLOMKVIST I need a research assistant. Can you authorize that? FRODE Yes. Do you have one? BLOMKVIST I can find one. FRODE I know a good one. She did the background check on you. BLOMKVIST The. FRODE Do you think we'd hire anyone for something like this without doing one? Blomkvist's brain tries to quickly inventory his life, pausing at its darker recesses. Frode nods. FRODE Yes, it was quite thorough. BLOMKVIST I want to read it. FRODE That I couldn't authorize. 77. 77. Blomkvist isn't sure how to play this. Then he is. Sets his napkin down, gets up and begins taking things down from the wall. Frode watches. Then sighs. 135 EXT. STOCKHOLM - DUSK 135 Only a few lights on in the Milton Security building. 136 INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - DUSK 136 It isn't often a subject of an investigation shows up in his office, but is always awkward when one does. BLOMKVIST Mr. Frode was kind enough to share your report with me. (it rests on his lap) The investigator's name is on it, but I can find no record of her, and I'm pretty good at that sort of thing. ARMANSKY Would it really matter what her name is? BLOMKVIST It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do. ARMANSKY Against policy. BLOMKVIST You sure? ARMANSKY Just like your sources. You understand. BLOMKVIST Let me give you a name then. He jots "Annika Giannini" on one of Armansky's Post-Its. BLOMKVIST My sister. She's a lawyer. (gestures to the report) There's information in here that could only have come from one place. I think you know what I mean. Silence. Armansky tries not to look sick. Then - 78. 78. ARMANSKY The reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed. She's a ward of the State. BLOMKVIST What does that have to do with anything. ARMANSKY She's had a rough life. Can we not make it rougher on her? Blomkvist just sits there, the picture of calm ... 137 INT. THE MILL - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 137 Cacophony of loud techno and a fringe clientele. Alone at a table drinking, Salander seems comfortable with the noise and her dateless status, but doesn't avoid a glance from an Asian girl at the bar, and doesn't tell her to go away when she comes over and motions to the empty chair. 138 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - MORNING 138 Salander and the girl from the club, asleep in bed, entwined like snakes. Salander wakes, disentangles herself, and is padding to the bathroom when there's a knock on her door. She stares it. No one ever knocks on her door. But someone knocks on it again. She crosses to it, wrapping herself in a blanket. SALANDER Who is it? BLOMKVIST O/S Mikael Blomkvist. Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone had invaded his privacy. She unlocks the door. Cracks it enough to see him. He smiles, but it's disconcerting. She's not sure it's a harmless one. BLOMKVIST May I come in? SALANDER Actually I'm not really up (yet) - BLOMKVIST That's okay. 79. 79. He pushes the door enough to pass. Has a paper bag and satchel with him. Takes in the place, including the girl in the bedroom, in a glance as he heads for the kitchen. BLOMKVIST I assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so I brought some bagel sandwiches. And tomato juice. Good for hangovers. Where do you keep the coffee? SALANDER Hey. Hey - (he stops; looks back) Who do you think you are? BLOMKVIST I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do. He opens cabinets looking for the coffee. She stares. BLOMKVIST We have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend. 139 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER 139 Blomkvist, plunging a French press, watches as the girlfriend lets herself out. In the bedroom, Salander finishes getting dressed, sticks her Taser in the back pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting that's more formal than she, or anyone who lives alone, is used to. BLOMKVIST You're awake. Good. Breakfast is ready. He pours her, and then himself, coffee. BLOMKVIST I guess I alarmed you showing up like this. SALANDER If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you. BLOMKVIST That won't be necessary. He smiles. His eyes are not unkind. As he helps himself to one of the bagels - 80. 80. BLOMKVIST Your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining. A copy of it sits next to his plate. SALANDER It wasn't meant to be. BLOMKVIST When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader. SALANDER Wennerstrom wasn't entertained. Blomkvist lets it go. BLOMKVIST Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you. I guess I should be flattered. He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, `sensitive' is the word he used. I'll use `illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer. (they study each other) I'm not going to do anything about that. I could but I won't. What I'm going to do is tell you a story. If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further. If it doesn't, I'll wash the dishes and leave ... Are you going to even touch your food? SALANDER What kind of research? BLOMKVIST Lisbeth - may I call you Lisbeth? I want you to help me catch a killer of women. 140 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY 140 He's arranged some of his research on the floor, and watches Salander kneeling before it, her eyes passing over photographs of the Vanger clan, the accident on the bridge, Xeroxes of the Leviticus list and verses. BLOMKVIST I've identified R.J. Her name's Rebecka Jacobsson. (MORE) 81. 81. BLOMKVIST (CONT'D) I have no idea who the others are - or how they're connected to the death of a 16 year old girl - but they have to be. His eyes settle on her blue-black "handcuffs" as hers settle on a copy of an old Hedestad Courier front page: the article about the grisly murder of Rebecka Jacobsson. BLOMKVIST We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with (anything) - She gets up, goes to her desk, begins jotting something down, ignoring him. BLOMKVIST What are you doing? SALANDER Getting started. You can keep talking if you want. Blomkvist, slightly taken aback, picks up the Leviticus Xerox from the floor. BLOMKVIST Would you like this? SALANDER Got it. That's what she's jotting down, from memory: the names, initials and Leviticus numbers. She wakes her laptop - 141 EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT 141 Hussein's taxi brings Blomkvist across to the island. 142 OMIT - INT. COTTAGE NIGHT 142 143 EXT/INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 143 He gets out with his satchel. Whistles for the cat - BLOMKVIST I'm home. He picks up the bowl of food he left on the porch, unlocks the door, goes inside, and sees the cat napping on his desk. He stares at it. Then at the door he just came through. Then the windows: all shut. 82. 82. Nothing has been disturbed as far as he can tell, but someone has been in here. 143A OMIT - 143A - 161A 143A 161AA INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY 161AA A window on Salander's laptop shows a map of Sweden divided into its 21 counties: Stockholm, Vasterbotten, Uppsala, etc. She starts with Skane. Hacks *however one does that* into its police department's crime database (or various county newspapers' databases). She fills in the year field with - 1947-1966 - and continues to types quickly. When we see what that is, she's in the middle of typing this filters list - Homicide Female Rape Decapitation Dismemberment Fire Altar Priest Prostitute Unsolved Mari Magda Sara R.L. The search produces a screen showing matches to some of the filter words - the rest of the case synopses greyed out. But also, with all of them, there's this message: Full Police Report Not Digitized 161AB INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY - (PLACEMENT CHANGE ONLY) 161AB Blomkvist watches a Hedestad locksmith install a dead- bolt on his front door. 161AC EXT. STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 161AC Salander comes out of her apartment building onto an empty street. Everyone is asleep. No lights on. It must be about 3am. She ties a duffel bag down, climbs onto the motorcycle, kick-starts it, races off into the night. 83. 83. 161AD EXT. VARMLAND - SWEDEN - DAWN 161AD Salander's Honda races past a pastoral agricultural landscape. 161B EXT. POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - MORNING 161B 161C INT. POLICE STATION - KARLSTAD - MORNING 161C An old police detective considers Salander's driver's license, her Milton Security ID, and a letter signed by the giant security firm's CEO, Dragan Armansky. DET. ISAKSSON No one's asked me about Magda in over 40 years. No one here even remembers her. He waits for her to say something, but she doesn't seem to understand conversational dynamics, so it's up to him. DET. ISAKSSON Why would a young lady like you want to know about such a brutal killing. SALANDER It interests me. DET. ISAKSSON Does it. She nods. He's not sure which he finds stranger - her appearance or her sincerity. He touches his own neck to indicate the tattoo on hers. DET. ISAKSSON What's that. A wasp? SALANDER A friend of mine calls me that. DET. ISAKSSON So you tattoo it on your neck? He'd be horrified if one of his grandchildren did that, but she just shrugs like it's no big deal. DET. ISAKSSON Who's this friend? SALANDER My trainer. DET. ISAKSSON Aerobics? 84. 84. SALANDER Boxing. Hard for him to picture. But, upon reflection - DET. ISAKSSON I have a feeling you're pretty good at that, even though you weigh - what - ninety pounds? (nothing from her) Float like a butterfly ... SALANDER What? DET. ISAKSSON (smiles) Come with me, Muhammad. 161D INT. KARLSTAD POLICE FILE ROOM - DAY 161D The old man rummages through an old file cabinet. DET. ISAKSSON Her husband was our first suspect - the husband is always the first suspect, and usually the last - but not this time. We moved on to a neighbor. Then a vagrant - He pulls a thick, yellowed folder out and sits with it and her at a table. DET. ISAKSSON Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time before you get to gypsies, and you know you're never going to solve it. And that troubles him still, that he never solved it. SALANDER How exactly was she killed? DET. ISAKSSON Miss - I'm sorry - SALANDER Salander. DET. ISAKSSON Miss Salander, if you don't mind my asking, when's the last time you ate? 85. 85. SALANDER I have a high metabolism. I can't put on weight. DET. ISAKSSON That's not why I ask. I ask because it's better to look at what I'm about to show you on an empty stomach. He pushes the folder across the table to her ... 161E OMIT - 161E - 161I 161E 161J INT. HEDESTAD HOSPITAL - DAY 161J Blomkvist comes in to find - like Morell did 40 years ago - a strange tableaux of suspects - two of whom he's only yet seen in photographs on his cottage wall - Birger, Cecilia, Frode, Martin, Gunnar, Anna, and, looking like an aging overdressed vampire, Isabella, smoking a cigarette. BLOMKVIST (to Frode) How is he? Frode takes Blomkvist aside. FRODE He needs surgery and there's no DNR. So it's up to the family to decide to resuscitate or not, and they're not good at decisions. He glances over to them. Isabella's staring back. FRODE How'd it go with Ms. Salander? BLOMKVIST She said yes. Isabella gets up to come over - BLOMVIST (to Frode) Can I see Henrik? FRODE He was asleep when I last looked in. We can check. 86. 86. ISABELLA No, you can't check. You can instruct him to pack his things and leave. MARTIN Mother - ISABELLA Don't use that tone with me. (to Blomkvist) This family's had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again. FRODE Actually, Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik. ISABELLA And who do you work for, Dirch? Remind me who pays your salary? BIRGER We should put this to a vote. MARTIN Don't be an idiot, Birger. BIRGER It's a family decision like any other. Cecilia? CECILIA What. BIRGER Am I right? CECILIA You are so seldom right about anything, it's hard for me to say yes. But (yes) - MARTIN No. We should do what Henrik wants, and we know what he wants. ISABELLA Henrik - is in there fighting for his life. This - (points to Blomkvist like he's an object) - is the last thing he needs. A nurse chooses this - the absolute worst time - to approach Isabella. 87. 87. NURSE O/S Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, you can't smoke in here. Isabella gives the nurse a look so hard it's almost frightening - calmly flicks an ash on the floor - waits for the nurse to leave - and looks back at Blomkvist. ISABELLA Go back to Stockholm. When we want a false chronicle of the family written by a libelist, we know who to call. 161K INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 161K As Frode guessed, Henrik is asleep, wired up to monitors, and doesn't stir as Blomkvist looks in on him. 161L EXT. YOUTH HOSTEL - NIGHT 161L Salander's motorcycle parked outside. 161M INT. YOUTH HOSTEL - NIGHT 161M As young travelers with huge backpacks try to sleep around her, Salander reads to herself from a Bible by flashlight. Leviticus 4:32 - HARRIET/PERNILLA If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish. He shall lay his hand upon it's head ...slaughter it... empty it's blood on the base of the altar ... and he shall be forgiven. 162 EXT. UDDEVALLA- DAY 162 Another police station. 162A INT. KARLSTAD POLICE STATION - DAY 162A Det. Isaksson is on the phone - DET. ISAKSSON Forget what she looks like, I vouch for her - 163 INT. POLICE STATION - UDDEVALLA - DAY 163 Another old police detective has Salander's credentials and a phone in hand - DET. ISAKSSON O/S She's smart. And she's serious about this. 88. 88. The old Uddevalla detective regards Salander waiting at the counter. Into the phone - UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE (convinced but just barely) All right. Thanks. He hangs up. To Salander - UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE This way, Miss. He escorts her to the file room. A164 OMIT - EXT. POLICE STATION - FARSTA ESTABLISHING A164 164 INT. FILE ROOM - POLICE STATION - UDDEVALLA - DAY 164 Just like Isaksson, the Uddevalla detective pulls open an old cabinet drawer, finds a particular ancient folder in it and hands it to Salander. She begins flipping through the reports and crime photos inside it, but we don't see them. SALANDER Can I make copies? UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE I can make them for you if our machine's been repaired. SALANDER That's okay. She begins photographing the reports and crime scene pictures with her camera as the detective watches her, not without some kind of strange sense of admiration. 164A OMIT: INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 164A 165 INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 165 Blomkvist considers Birger's photo on his wall: Brother of Cecilia, son of Harald the Nazi, 21-years-old when his cousin Harriet disappeared ... 166 EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING 166 Blomkvist and Martin drink Skane. Martin's normally breezy demeanor seems to have suffered from his mother's public displays. Embarrassed by them and her, he's more serious now. MARTIN My family is impossible. It's why the company is such a mess. (MORE) 89. 89. MARTIN (CONT'D) Please accept my apology for my mother's behavior. BLOMKVIST It's all right. MARTIN It's not all right, she's unbearable. But it has nothing to do with you. It's between her and Henrik ... She lost it when my father died. The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated. She's never forgiven him. And he seems as lost now as he must have been then. MARTIN You have to stay and keep working. You're Henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution. Put this to rest for him one way of the other, and I'll try to keep my mother away. But, please, do it as quickly as you can. BLOMKVIST I'll (try) - They glance off to the sound of a motorcycle. It appears, roars up, parks. Salander climbs off it and shoulders a duffel bag. Blomkvist seems surprised to see her. BLOMKVIST Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger. MARTIN How do you do. SALANDER Fine. She comes past them without another word. Martin can't help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos. Looks after her as she disappears into the cottage. It's hard to believe, but he has to ask: MARTIN Girlfriend? 90. 90. BLOMKVIST Assistant. 166A INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER 166A Blomkvist comes in as Martin drives off. Salander is already unpacking her things - laptop, charger, change of clothes. What's she doing, moving in? BLOMKVIST Any trouble finding the place? SALANDER Everyone in town knows who and where you are. BLOMKVIST That's comforting. Are you hungry? Want a sandwich? SALANDER No. Busy setting up her laptop on his desk, starting it up, sitting down at it, she's all but ignoring him. BLOMKVIST I used to have a motorcycle. When I was 19. SALANDER I know. She hands him her own dog-eared Bible and a copy of the list of names and initials he gave her - SALANDER The five cases from Harriet's list. And five more she missed - three I'm sure about. Five more? Blomkvist stares at her but she's turned back to her laptop, bringing up police reports and crime scene photos. SALANDER Rebecka was the first, like you thought ... M.H., is Mari Holmberg - a prostitute in Kalmar - murdered in 1954. Leviticus verse 20, line 18. 91. 91. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ BLOMKVIST (reading from it) "If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood." Blomkvist doesn't see a connection. SALANDER She was raped and stabbed, but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin. R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957 - Salander brings up more crime photos - SALANDER Cleaning woman and part-time palm reader, tied up with a clothesline, gagged, raped, head crushed with a rock. Leviticus 20:27. BLOMKVIST "A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning." She's lit a cigarette and brings up the next photos - BLOMKVIST I only smoke outside. SALANDER (ignoring the comment) Sara Witt, 1964. Daughter of a pastor. Tied to her bed, raped, charred in the fire that burned down her house. Leviticus - BLOMKVIST 21:9. "The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with (fire) - SALANDER (on top of his last word) Magda Lovisa Sjoberg, 1960 - Several photos of a dead woman and dead cow - SALANDER Found in a barn, stabbed and raped with farm tools. A cow in the next stall with its throat slit, its blood splashed on her, hers on it. 92. 92. BLOMKVIST Leviticus 20:16 - "If a woman lies with any beast, you shall kill the woman and the beast, their blood is upon (them) - SALANDER (again on his last word) Lea Persson, 1962 - A photo of a pretty girl in riding jodhpurs, petting a horse, and several more of her dead naked body on a wet cement floor surrounded by tropical fish. SALANDER Found by her sister in their pet shop - raped, beaten. The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums. There was a parakeet inside her. Leviticus 26:21/22. Before Blomkvist can find the verse, she's on to the next ones. More photos of murdered girls - SALANDER Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled, a burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967, a student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated - BLOMKVIST Okay - SALANDER I'm not done - BLOMKVIST It's all right, we're looking for a serial murderer ... But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island? Salander, as we know, is not paid to give her opinion. She's a hunter/gatherer, not an analyst. But Blomkvist asked, so she gives it - SALANDER She was looking for him, too. 167 OMIT - INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 167 93. 93. 168 EXT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT 168 The silence they just left has followed them out here. The island, more than ever, feels haunted as Blomkvist looks off, smoking. BLOMKVIST Rape. Torture. Fire. Animals. Religion. Anything I'm missing? SALANDER The names. They're all Biblical. The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary - Sara, Rakel - all from the Old Testament. BLOMKVIST Which means they're Jewish names. He glances off to Harald's dark house. BLOMKVIST If there's one thing the Vangers have more than their share of, it's Nazis. There's one of them. The Nazi's shadowy form crosses behind the shades ... 169 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT 169 He pokes at embers in the fireplace to try coax some flames. BLOMKVIST I can see why Armansky values you so highly. Your work is very good. SALANDER It interests me. He takes a blanket from the back of a chair. BLOMKVIST I'll take the couch. You can have the bed. SALANDER I can sleep on a couch. BLOMKVIST So can I. She takes the blanket from him and sits with it on the couch. He watches her a moment. 94. 94. BLOMKVIST Okay. (heads off to the bedroom) Good night. SALANDER Night. She switches off the lamp. Then, in a moment, in the dark - SALANDER Harriet's name isn't. BLOMKVIST Isn't what. SALANDER Jewish. A170 EXT. COTTAGE - MORNING - ESTABLISHING A170 170 INT. COTTAGE - MORNING 170 Salander browses through an iPhoto album of old photographs of Blomkvist and the motorcycle he mentioned. In some of them, Erika is with him. In all of them, he's wearing a leather jacket not unlike Salander's. BLOMKVIST O/S What are you doing? He's just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch to see her at his laptop. She closes the album, leaving on the screen what she was looking at before: his iMovie of the parade and some annotated police files. SALANDER Going over your notes. BLOMKVIST They're encrypted. She gives him a don't-be-a-child look. SALANDER Have some coffee. BLOMKVIST I will. And then we'll have a talk about what's yours and what's mine. Blomkvist drags himself up, pours himself some coffee, adds some milk. 95. 95. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ SALANDER It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos. BLOMKVIST Thank you. SALANDER Too bad you don't have hers. BLOMKVIST Whose. She doesn't say. He comes over. She plays the iMovie, stops on a frame before Harriet turns her head. Points to a young couple standing among the people behind her. The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand. SALANDER Her. She advances to the next frame: The woman has raised the camera to her eye. And the next: Harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's Instamatic flares slightly. Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice it before, and what it means: Though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently included in it whatever - whoever - Harriet saw at that moment across the street. BLOMKVIST Excuse me. He takes over his laptop from her, finds the later Courier photos he didn't include in his iMovie, after Harriet has left. In one, the couple is moving off the other way. In another, they're getting in a parked car to leave. He sharpens the Photoshop contrast. The rear license plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make out even by squinting. BLOMKVIST Can you read that? SALANDER A, C, Three - the rest is blocked. 96. 96. He focuses on a decal on the car's back window. The letters are even small and blurrier, but she thinks she can make out - SALANDER N, something, R, S, J - BLOMKVIST Norsjo. SALANDER Then something, K, something, R, I, F, something, I - BLOMKVIST Carpentry. (points below the letters) Is that a phone number? SALANDER Too small to read. He gets up. Heads for the front door to smoke his cigarette outside - BLOMKVIST (ADR) I'm going to have to go to Norsjo. He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch - The charred corpse of the cat. Its legs - sawn off and arranged in the shape of a swastika - lie in the middle of a dark circle of blood. He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing close-ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop the seat of her motorcycle. Blomkvist stares off at Harald's house ... 171 OMIT: EXT. COTTAGE - MORNING 171 172 OMIT: INT. FRODE'S HOUSE - DAY 172 172A INT. HEDESTAD HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY 172A As Frode scrolls through the photos of the dismembered cat on Salander's camera, horrified by them, she regards at a table across the room: Birger, Isabella and Gunner. BLOMKVIST I wouldn't think Harald would sign his name like this, would you? 97. 97. FRODE I can't say I know how he thinks. He might. BLOMKVIST Has anyone spoken to him about me since I've been here? FRODE Maybe Isabella. No one else. BLOMKVIST Could she do something like this? Frode glances off to her. She's staring at Salander. And turns to Birger. ISABELLA Who's this creature now? Frode takes one more look at the photos before - FRODE I'm calling this off. BLOMKVIST No. You're authorizing me to rent a car. 172AA INT. HOSPITAL - LATER - DAY 172AA Blomkvist and Salander coming down a corridor on their way out. BLOMKVIST I'm sorry if that was uncomfortable. SALANDER They don't bother me. BLOMKVIST I'm sure they're not used to people who look like you. SALANDER They don't like you either. 172B EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 172B A car and a motorcycle split apart at an interchange - the Volvo to the north, Salander's Honda to the south. 173 EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY 173 Salander pulls her Honda into an underground garage. 98. 98. 174 INT. MILTON SECURITY - DAY 174 No one says hello to her - nor she to them - as she strides through the place to the tech room. INSERT: Cases snapped open revealing sophisticated surveillance equipment - several cameras, mounts, hand monitor, cables. TECH CLERK I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky. SALANDER So call him. The clerk picks up a phone, but then sets it back down. Picks up the list again. TECH CLERK Next time, I'd prefer you fill out the proper paperwork. A175 EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY A175 A Volvo speeds along a rural highway, far from Hedestad and the Vangers. 175 INT. VOLVO - MOVING - DAY 175 On the passenger seat - INSERT: the car rental agreement - a print of the parade photo of the couple getting into the car he was looking at with Salander on his laptop - and a hand- written note that reads - NORSJO SNICKERIFABRIK 175A EXT/INT. HIGHWAY / VOLVO - DAY 175A A POV through the windshield of a highway sign alerts him the Norsjo exit is coming up. 176 EXT. NORSJO - DAY 176 The main street of a very small town. The Volvo pulls to a stop outside its only hardware store. 177 INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY 177 An ancient place with narrow aisles crammed with stuff. CLERK 1 Can I help you? 99. 99. The clerk - for what Blomkvist needs - is too young. BLOMKVIST I'm waiting for the older gentleman, thanks. He gestures to a clerk in his 60's helping a customer. 178 INT. HARDWARE STORE - LATER 178 The older clerk looks at the parade photo of the couple. BLOMKVIST The carpentry shop is gone. I don't know if he worked there or not. If he did, maybe he used to buy hardware here. CLERK 2 I don't recognize him. Sorry. BLOMKVIST I had to start somewhere. Thanks. As he gathers up the photos to leave - CLERK 2 I'm no detective, but I think I would've started at the retirement home. Blomkvist looks up. Not a bad idea. 178A INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY 178A Salander checks a `mirror' of Bjurman's computer on her laptop. Skims one of the monthly reports she instructed him to write. A179 EXT. RETIREMENT HOME - NORSJO - ESTABLISHING A179 179 INT. RETIREMENT HOME - NORSJO - DAY 179 A group of elderly men and women in a rec room pass Blomkvist's photos around. One old man offers - FORSMAN This is Brannlund's kid. He was a contractor, the father. BLOMKVIST Brannlund. FORSMAN Assar. 100. 100. Blomkvist writes the name down. BLOMKVIST You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, the son? FORSMAN Next to his father at the cemetery. He was killed in an accident on a job site years ago. But she might be alive - (the woman in the picture) His widow. A180 EXT. BRANNLUND HOUSE - ESTABLISHING A180 180 INT. BRANNLUND HOUSE - DAY 180 She is still alive, and sitting across from Blomkvist in her living room as he takes out his photos - BLOMKVIST In 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband. He shows her one of the photos. MILDRED Oh, my goodness, there we are. Who took this? BLOMKVIST Photographer at the local paper. She smiles at the picture; it brings back good memories. BLOMKVIST You were taking pictures, too. Which I'd very much like to see if by some miracle you still have them. MILDRED It wouldn't be a miracle. We were on our honeymoon. But why? Blomkvist thinks about making something up. Decides not to. Indicates Harriet in the photo - BLOMKVIST This girl was killed that day, soon after seeing something across the street that frightened her. MILDRED How awful. 101. 101. Blomkvist nods; Mildred takes a closer look at the photo. MILDRED She does look terrified. Mildred gets up with purpose, goes into another room, returns with a photo album. Leafs past wedding photos, to honeymoon photos and stops on the only one she took of the parade. She hands the album to Blomkvist. The snapshot shows the float with the harem girls in foreground, and - in the background, across the street - several out of focus figures - BLOMKVIST Would you mind if I made a copy of this? 181 EXT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 181 Establish. 182 INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 182 He gets in the elevator without really looking at the figure already in it. BJURMAN Ground, please. A finger presses it. The doors close and the elevator starts down. SALANDER How's your sex life? Bjurman, terrified, backs into a corner. She presses a button and the elevator jerks to a stop between floors. SALANDER I didn't care much for your last report. (which she has in hand) It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it. Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's. BJURMAN I under(stand) - SALANDER Don't speak. I don't want to hear your voice. Just nod. He nods. 102. 102. SALANDER Start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me. He nods. She gets the elevator going again and steps closer to him. He tries bowing his head like a dog being scolded. She lifts his chin like he did to her before he raped her. SALANDER And stop visiting tattoo removal websites or I'll do it again - right here. She touches his forehead. He backs away. The doors open and she steps out, leaving him in there, looking too frightened to move. The doors close. 183 INT. COTTAGE - LATE AFTERNOON 183 Having returned and scanned Mildred's snapshot into Photoshop, Blomkvist better defines on his laptop its background and the people in frame across the street from where Harriet was standing: INSERT: Couples, kids, a clown. INSERT: The watch repair shop clock that reads, 2:00. INSERT: A figure standing slightly apart from the other people. It's too blurry to make out his face or age, but he has light brown hair, dark slacks, and a dark blazer with some kind of patch on the pocket. 184 EXT. STOCKHOLM - LATE AFTERNOON 184 Salander blasts onto the highway headed north. 185 INT COTTAGE - AFTERNOON 185 Blomkvist regards Isabella's two photos on the wall. In one she's a stunning young woman. In the other, the old wreck she's become. He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo. Where a second more current photo of him should go is a Courier article about his drowning in 1965. That's when Isabella changed - and this is where it happened - in this old house out on the point. He untacks the article - 103. 103. 186 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATE AFTERNOON 186 The boathouse hasn't fared well. Neither has the dock Blomkvist has to walk on to reach it. He glances inside - no boat, just dark water slapping against the pilings - looks back to the shore at the long-uninhabited cabin. 187 INT. CABIN - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON 187 No electricity but enough light spills through the open door for him to see the neglected, shadowy interior: Beds with bare, or no, mattresses. Sticks of furniture. Old water-stained books strewn around. Beer bottles and other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers. It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing what you know. He kneels to look at some of the books. Mickey Spillane, a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about the USSR, a children's book. He opens this last one and sees "Harriet" scrawled in a very young child's hand. 188 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATE AFTERNOON 188 Having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds himself at the highest point on the island. Stops to rest at the ruins of a fort. A piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts. As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot - He throws himself to the ground. Crawls desperately around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead. He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank. He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind him - the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him - a clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice - He runs for the trees. Dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands. Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman. Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait. 104. 104. 189 INT/EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING 189 Salander, returned from Stockholm, moves around the cottage - inside and out - installing the equipment she brought from Milton Security: Motion detectors - security cameras - software that bisects a PC screen into quadrants showing night-vision views of each corner of the cottage. 190 OMIT: EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - EVENING 190 191 INT/EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 191 A figure appears on a quadrant of Salander's surveillance PC. Comes past the motorcycle and nearly reaches the porch before she hears - BLOMKVIST O/S It's me. She opens the door to see him covered in blood, pressing a torn piece of his shirt to his bleeding head - and almost gasps. BLOMKVIST It's that bad? 192 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 192 She turns the bathtub's hot water tap - BLOMKVIST Is it still bleeding? (touches the wound) It's still bleeding ... why is it still bleeding ... She pulls a length of dental floss from its case - BLOMKVIST (ADR) Is that dental floss? SALANDER Yes. Splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails - Feeds one of the lengths of floss through the eye of a needle - BLOMKVIST What is that - (he can see it's a needle) Is that necessary? 105. 105. SALANDER Yes. BLOMKVIST We can't just tape it? SALANDER No. She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits - still in his pants - half-submerged in tepid water - bottle of vodka in his hand. BLOMKVIST Did you sterilize that? SALANDER No. BLOMKVIST You didn't? She splashes some of the vodka on the needle. Most of it goes in the water. Hands the bottle back to him. SALANDER Drink some more. He takes a swig from the vodka bottle. She reaches to his face with the needle and floss - BLOMKVIST Careful, it's my eye. SALANDER Don't move. It takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh. He pulls away with a groan. She just looks at him. Waits for him to take another swig of vodka to steel himself. She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through the skin. And after that it doesn't seem to be so bad. As she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work. Hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down. 192A INT. COTTAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 192A He comes out of the bathroom in his soaking wet pants and collapses on the bed. She works to pull his pants off. 106. 106. BLOMKVIST What am I doing here ... why did I ever come up here ... He touches the wound and looks at his fingers - BLOMKVIST It's too dark to see ... did it stop bleeding ... I think maybe it has ... it still fucking hurts ... 192B INT. COTTAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 192B She regards the surveillance monitor, the night-vision views of the cottage. She can't believe it but she feels vigilant more for his sake than her own. She goes to a window and looks out. Sees her own reflection in the glass and studies it. Then kicks her boots off. 193 INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 193 She comes into the bedroom in her t-shirt and underwear. He's still muttering without looking at her. BLOMKVIST It wasn't an accident ... Somebody was shooting at me ... It's insane ... these people are insane ... SALANDER No one's shooting at you now. She pulls her t-shirt over his stitched-up head, cocooning it against her breasts. Silence. Then - BLOMKVIST I'm pretty sure this isn't a good idea. SALANDER Why. He extracts his head from the cocoon and looks at her. BLOMKVIST Apart from the fact that I'm old, we work together. SALANDER You work with what's-her-name. That's worked out for you. He nods. That's true. Then - 107. 107. BLOMKVIST I have some standards of behavior, believe it or not. SALANDER You need to stop talking. She climbs on top of him. 194 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT 194 Afterwards. She opens his dwindling pack of cigarettes. Lights one. Glances over to him lying next to her. He's not looking at the smoke but rather the startling tattoos on her bare legs and arms. Eventually - SALANDER You want me to open a window? He shakes his head no. Reaches for the cigarette. Takes a drag. Hands it back. 195 INT. COTTAGE - MORNING 195 He wakes. Comes out to find a proper place setting on the table. Sits with Salander. Listens to that awkward, but not altogether unpleasant silence you always hear in this situation the next morning. She breaks it - SALANDER I like working with you. BLOMKVIST I like working with you, too. 196 OMIT - INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY 196 196A EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - DAY 196A Establish. 196B INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - DAY 196B Frode and Martin stare at Blomkvist's unprofessionally sutured head wound; Salander near him like an emaciated bodyguard. FRODE People hunt on the island, Mikael. Gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner. It could have been a stray shot. MARTIN Not from Gunner. If he wanted to shoot him, he'd have shot him. 108. 108. FRODE We get poachers. They're not always such great shots. MARTIN Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is? This has to stop. Frode regards Blomkvist. FRODE Do you want to stop? BLOMKVIST I have police reports, photos, Henrik's notes, my own notes, and Lisbeth's research. What I don't have are Vanger Industries records. That's what I want. FRODE Why? Blomkvist doesn't say. Only - BLOMKVIST Will you authorize it? FRODE I could but why on earth would I? BLOMKVIST Because I'm asking. FRODE The private corporate records. (Blomkvist nods) How far back? BLOMKVIST All the way. Frode exchanges a look with Martin. BLOMKVIST Henrik said I have access to everything I need. This is what I need. FRODE That's not what he meant. BLOMKVIST Let's ask him. 109. 109. FRODE He's not well enough to ask. BLOMKVIST I'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement, if that helps you. FRODE Excuse us a moment. Frode and Martin step away to confer in private. MARTIN I think Henrik would say yes. FRODE That's why he has me. To protect him from himself. This is insane. MARTIN What do we have to hide? FRODE Over the course of 120 years of doing business? Plenty. MARTIN If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission. This goes against every privileged, confidential bone in the lawyer's body. He can only stare at Blomkvist and Salander across the room, wondering why he hired either one of them. 197 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATER - DAY 197 Blomkvist and Salander walk down the road from Martin's house. SALANDER What am I looking for? BLOMKVIST Any connections between the company's holdings and the towns where the women were killed ... and everything about Frode. 198 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY 198 Vanger Industries' corporate archives are kept in the oldest building in the town's warehouse district. The rumble of Salander's motorcycle announces her arrival. 110. 110. 199 INT. COTTAGE - SAME TIME - DAY 199 Like someone visiting a relative they never liked, Blomkvist reviews yet again the photos from `that day' - scrolling through the bridge accident shots - He stops. One of the figures has something in his hand he hadn't noticed before. It and the figure are somewhat blurred in movement - but it looks like a gun. He sharpens the contrast to reveal that the gun is in fact a Hasselblad-type camera. Looks at the man's face - then at his wall of Vanger family photos - unhappy to see it matches Harald ... 200 INT. VANGER INDUSTRIES - LATER - DAY 200 Carbon-copied or original documents from the 50's and 60's surround Salander like the water around the island: Financial analyses, annual reports, internal memoranda, trade union agreements, brittle news clippings, corporate staff photographs, one of which she's regarding now: A much younger Frode, posing against a wall of law books. 200A INT. COTTAGE - DAY 200A The photo of Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall. BLOMKVIST V/O Your father was taking pictures that day no one has seen. 201 INT. CECILIA'S HOUSE - DAY 201 Cecilia looks at the blurred bridge photo of Harald with the camera in his hand. Then at Blomkvist, coolly. BLOMKVIST I'd like to if I could. CECILIA So ask him. BLOMKVIST I was wondering if you could do that. CECILIA I don't speak to him, as you know. BLOMKVIST You couldn't make an exception in my case. He gives her his most disarming smile. It usually works with women, but doesn't seem to have much affect on her. 111. 111. CECILIA Are you afraid to be in the same room with him? I'm not saying you shouldn't be. BLOMKVIST You won't help me? CECILIA Sorry. 202 INT. VANGER INDUSTRIES - DAY 202 Salander gets up and crosses to an anteroom where an unhappy older woman - the archive manager - seems to be doing nothing but waiting for the strange girl to leave. LINDGREN Are you finished? SALANDER No. I need to know where all the factories, offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966. LINDGREN You already have everything. SALANDER I don't. Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships, or suppliers. LINDGREN Then you'll have to do without. SALANDER Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need, and I need this. LINDGREN He said you have access to this floor. SALANDER Call him. The woman stares at her for a long moment, then picks up the phone. 203 INT. ARCHIVES - DAY 203 Stairs lead them to a higher floor. The woman climbs a step-stool. Pulls a couple of large binders from a high shelf. Salander doesn't help her off the stool and the woman looks at her even more unhappily than before. 112. 112. 204 INT. HARALD'S DEN - DAY 204 The blinds, as usual, closed. Couple of lamps throw shadows on the walls which display hunting and military trophies - wild game heads, sabers and vintage firearms - some of Harald's dearer photographs - some photographs in dusty frames. Blomkvist, alone in the room, looks at them: Swedish Nazi leader in the 1930's. HARALD Sven Olof Lindholm. The 92-year-old comes into the room from the kitchen, followed by a housekeeper with a tea tray. Indicates the younger man in the photo, also in a Nazi uniform, that Blomkvist is looking at. HARALD Me. Blomkvist nods. Has no idea what to say. But Harald waits for more of a response. Finally - BLOMKVIST Handsome. HARALD (taps another) Birger Furugard. Me. (and another) Per Engdahl. (and another) Me. Blomkvist's eyes shift to a bolt-action Mauser infantry rifle displayed on a shelf ... HARALD But your interest is in my more candid photographic work. 205 INT. ARCHIVES - DAY 205 Spread out on the desk: A map of Sweden showing the factory sites and other Vanger holdings - and one she made earlier where the nine women were murdered. Dots appear at the same locations on both. On a handwritten list of the victims, she puts a check next to Rebecka Jacobsson, 1949, Hedestad - moves on to Mari Holmberg, 1954, Kalmar - begins sifting through the mountain of Vanger Industries clippings from that year - 113. 113. 206 INT. HARALD'S DEN - DAY 206 A bony Nazi pouring tea in a shadowy room with you is bad, but the rabbit-print tea cozy only makes it worse. Blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an old shoebox of unsorted photographs: A holiday at Lake Como, early 1950's judging from the cars; a Vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope. Harald holds out a pack of cigarettes. Blomkvist comes over, pulls one out. HARALD Blom ... kvist ... (lights the cigarette) With an `o' - or a `u.' BLOMKVIST `o.' HARALD An `o.' Blom - kvist. Harald doesn't say it, but his nod means, `not Jewish then. Good' Blomkvist returns to the photos, glancing up occasionally to the smoke curling up past Harald's face as he examines the journalist at work. HARALD I'm not a recluse. I don't close my door to anyone. They just don't visit. BLOMKVIST Perhaps if you redecorated. HARALD Hide the past like they do. Under a thin, shiny veneer. Like an Ikea table. (Blomkvist shrugs) I'm the most honest of all of them. BLOMKVIST The family. HARALD Sweden. Blomkvist opens another shoebox. Lying on top is a photograph of the bridge accident, and, under it, a few more. He takes them out and angles them toward a lamp. 114. 114. HARALD Two point eight. BLOMKVIST Pardon me? HARALD The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad. Excellent lens. Blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively, but the bridge photos don't tell him anything he doesn't already know. He finds several more that appear to be a hunting expedition - men and blood hounds - but then sees Morell in one, more policemen, and a stricken Henrik in boots and raincoat, and realizes this is the search party. Off to the side, a young man, head turned half away, wearing a dark blazer with a gold patch, which that 2.8 Zeiss lens makes clear is a prep school insignia. A lion. HARALD Landscape? Some nice landscapes there. BLOMKVIST No, it's - I can't tell who it is from this angle. He takes the photo over to the Nazi who only has to glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephew's son: HARALD That's Gottfried's boy. BLOMKVIST Martin? Harald nods, hands it back, smokes. It's not unusual Martin would have joined the search party - it would be unusual if he hadn't - it's his sister that's missing - but this blazer he's wearing troubles Blomkvist - HARALD Handsome but useless young man, Martin. Like his father. 207 INT. ARCHIVES - DUSK 207 The archive manager shoulders her purse, locks her anteroom, and approaches Salander. LINDGREN We're closing. 115. 115. SALANDER (without looking up) Nowhere near finished. LINDGREN I'm not staying late. SALANDER I am. And I need access to all the rooms, including any that are locked. (nothing from the woman) Call Frode. 208 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSK 208 As Henrik naps and Martin clears his dinner tray, Frode listens to the caller on the room phone - LINDGREN V/O She wants to look at everything. I don't like her and I don't trust her. There's something wrong with her. FRODE Hang on a second - (to Martin) I'm going to let you decide. It's Ms. Lindgren again. MARTIN (takes the phone) Yes, Ingrid, what's the problem? LINDGREN V/O This girl wants a set of keys now. To my room as well. It's outrageous. MARTIN It's fine. Just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when she's done. 209 INT. ARCHIVES - DUSK 209 Having found nothing of interest in the 1954 files, Salander moves on to the 1957 killing of Rakel Lunde. The older woman comes back. Drops a set of keys on the desk. LINDGREN Stay all night if you want. Leave the keys with the guard. The woman leaves. Her footsteps echo and fade. Salander reads a yellowed clipping from a Landskrona newspaper: 116. 116. It's about Vanger Industries hiring a local contractor, Carlen Construction, to build a plant. Gottfried Vanger - here to sign the contract. But all that really interests Salander is the date. The article was published one day after the paper printed the story of the discovery of Rakel's battered naked body. Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona - and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction. The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger. Gottfried Vanger ... which one was he again? Salander brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall of the cottage: the Vanger family tree. Gottfried Vanger, Son of Margareta & Richard the Nazi Husband of crazy Isabella, Father of Martin and Harriet Of all the Vangers - at least back in 1950 when Harriet was born - Gottfried was the most handsome. Clark Gable good looks. She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari Holmberg and the 1954 Vanger files. 210 INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 210 Blomkvist flips through one of Morell's reports stating everyone's whereabouts on the day Harriet's disappeared. INSERT: Across from Martin Vanger's name it reads: "Arrived on 4:30 train." He brings up the Photoshop-enhanced Brannlund parade photo on his laptop - INSERT: The figure with the blazer and pocket patch standing near the watch repair clock, which reads: 2:00. And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' - INSERT: Young Martin with the search party, the emblem clearly visible on his blazer pccket. He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967. The photo is a school wallet photo - 117. 117. INSERT: She's wearing a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin. He looks at Mildred's parade photo of the figure standing near the watch repair clock. It reads, 2:00. And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' with the search party. In it and the parade photo, he's wearing the same blazer. He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967. The photo is a school wallet photo - in a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin. 211 INT. VANGER ARCHIVES - EVENING 211 Knowing what she's looking for now, Salander finds it fairly quickly: A clipping about a timber company Vanger Industries bought in Kalmar and an interview in its local paper with Gottfried, two days after Mari's murder. She jumps to 1960 - Magda Lovisa Sjoberg - Karlstad - and an article in its local paper - this time with a photo of Gottfried - about a union dispute at its factory there. 212 EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING 212 Blomkvist comes out with his cell phone, tries to make a bar or two materialize on it. Dials but only gets a beep that asks him if he wants to `retry.' He doesn't. Instead, under the darkening sky, he looks off to the point. Martin's house is small in the distance, but he can see there's no car in the driveway and no lights on. He stares at it for a long time ... 213 INT. VANGER ARCHIVES - EVENING 213 Salander pulls a 1962 Uddevalla paper from the files. Same day this time, the same page of the newspaper: Lea Persson's horrific murder and an story quoting Gottfried about an expansion project to the town's harbor. She regards Gottfried's newsprint photo: His face looks more than 8 years older than the one in Kalmar but that's what drinking to excess, and murder perhaps, does to you. 214 INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 214 Blomkvist lays the Lena Andersson article - and the photograph of the figure at the parade - atop the rest of the junk on the desk - and quickly scrolls through photos on his laptop, leaving on the screen for Salander to see when she returns: Martin's recent Vanger Industries PR portrait ... 118. 118. 215 INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT 215 Salander has hit a snag. Gets up. We stay to have a look at the problem she leaves: the victims list - now with "Gottfried" jotted down next to all but one name: 1967 - Lena Andersson - Uppsala Next to it, the newspaper article about the murdered girl, with a school photo. And, next to that, the reason there's no "Gottfried" notation: his obituary in a Hedestad Courier clipping: 1965. We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps - 216 INT. ARCHIVES - SAME TIME - NIGHT 216 As annoying as the older woman was, it was less creepy with her around. Salander is alone in the old building now, wandering through it looking for vending machines. She finds some. Drops coins in one. A cup fills with coffee. She gets a candy bar from another. The coffee machine finishes. The place again plunges into silence. She starts back with her snack down a hallway - 217 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT 217 Trying to look like he's just out for a stroll, Blomkvist walks past Martin's dark house, then turns around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness. He tries the door. Locked. Comes down off the porch as if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around to the side of the house. He peers through a floor-to-ceiling window, but can't see much inside. Comes around to the back and looks in another window. Tries the back door. Unlocked. 218 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 218 He can't see a lot in the dark, but doesn't dare switch on any lights. He crosses through the kitchen, but we stay behind to regard a closed basement door ... We pick him up again as he comes into the living room, follow him to a wall of glass. It's pitch black outside. We follow him down a hallway - but stop at a bedroom doorway as if this is as far as we care to go. We stay at the threshold and watch him go in and look around. As he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet - 119. 119. 218A EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT 218A A pair of headlights comes across the bridge. 218B INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 218B Blomkvist comes back to the wall of glass. Still no lights out there. Heads off to the hall again. 218C EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT 218C The car parks fifty yards from Blomkvist's cottage. The headlights blink off. Someone climbs out. 218D INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 218D Blomkvist comes into a study. Lots of books and framed photographs. He begins looking around. 218E EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT 218E The headlights come up the road leading to the point. 218F INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 218F Blomkvist approaches a gun case in the study. Hunting rifles. Three of them - and an empty space for a fourth one. The trees outside the study window flare with light. A moment later, Blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel. Martin is back, and Blomkvist is in his house. We rush back down the hall with Blomkvist. Hopefully Martin will enter through the front door because we're going to try to get out the back one - Blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down with him. Then up again - through the kitchen - past the basement door - grabs a knife from a drawer - shoves it in a back pocket - hurries out the rear door - 219 EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 219 Blomkvist tries to steady his breathing as he slinks around the side of the house. As he passes a window, it lights up - and we again hit the ground with him. He hurries across the yard, trips over something in the dark - a sprinkler? - and goes down again into wet muck. He gets up and starts down the road as if returning from a leisurely evening walk - which would be more convincing without the limp - not daring to look back as he goes. 120. 120. MARTIN O/S Hello? Mikael? Blomkvist stops. His heart pounds. Martin comes down his porch and walks toward his car. MARTIN Your evening stroll? BLOMKVIST Hi. How are you? Martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it. MARTIN I stopped at the hospital on my way home. Henrik asked me to ask you something. BLOMKVIST What. MARTIN Come on in, I'll make you a drink. Naturally, this is the last thing Blomkvist wants to do, but it would be more suspicious if he refuses. He heads back to Martin's house, trying not to limp. 220 INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT 220 Finished with her candy bar and coffee, Salander opens the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything of note in Uppsala, where Lena was killed. She finds no news of factories opening there that year, but she does come across a PR newsletter about a winter retreat for fifty employees and their families. There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best Worker of the Year plaque. And another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and Vanger family members: The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne flute - as everyone else does the same - except for the young man at the far right foreground. He looks sullen. But what teenager wouldn't at an event as boring as this. Salander would look even more sullen. She checks the caption and reads: ... far right, Martin Vanger (19), currently studying in Uppsala. 121. 121. Uppsala. Same place as Lena - though it's what young Martin is wearing that strikes her: an Uppsala private school blazer with a lion on its pocket - the same as on Lena Andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the article about her murder. 221 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 221 It's not as eerie with the lights on - except for the fact there's a killer in it. Martin sets the golf clubs down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen. MARTIN What happened to you? BLOMKVIST When. MARTIN Now. Blomkvist's clothes. The fresh mud stains. BLOMKVIST I fell in the dark. MARTIN You don't have a flashlight? I'll give you one. BLOMKVIST I just wasn't being careful. Martin smiles, but Blomkvist isn't sure what he said warrants one. Martin begins rummaging through a drawer for a flashlight. The knife block - with one missing - is right there. MARTIN How's the investigation? BLOMKVIST Nothing new to report. Blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe. Martin, not seeming to notice, finds a mini-Maglite in the drawer. MARTIN Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever. Maybe she'll turn something up. BLOMKVIST Maybe. 122. 122. Martin hands Blomkvist the mini-Maglite. BLOMKVIST Thanks. 222 INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT 222 Salander scrolls through laptop photos to the one at the parade taken by the Brannlund woman on her honeymoon; the people across the street and the blurry figure wearing the blazer with the "pocket square" ... SALANDER Hello, Martin. 223 INT. MARTIN'S KITCHEN - LATER 223 Martin pours Scotch. Hands one to Blomkvist. BLOMKVIST What did he say? MARTIN What? BLOMKVIST You said Henrik asked you to ask me something. MARTIN I just did. BLOMKVIST What? MARTIN How the investigation's going. That was his question. BLOMKVIST Oh. Blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells, but Martin follows them. MARTIN You hunt? We should go hunting together sometime. BLOMKVIST Sure. They drink. Listen to a silence. 123. 123. MARTIN Nothing at all? (Blomkvist doesn't know what he means) New. To report. BLOMKVIST No. Martin regards Blomkvist in another silence. Then - MARTIN I can see you're anxious. BLOMKVIST No. MARTIN To get home. After your walk. BLOMKVIST I suppose I am. MARTIN To have dinner. With your girlfriend. BLOMKVIST My assistant. Yes. MARTIN We'll have better luck with a gun. BLOMKVIST Sorry? MARTIN When we go hunting. Martin pulls open a bar drawer and takes from it a handgun. MARTIN A gun. Rather than a knife. He gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the knife protruding from a back pocket of Blomkvist's jeans. There are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his shoes. MARTIN You just couldn't stay away, could you. Blomkvist doesn't know what to say. Martin's demeanor, even in this situation, remains cordial. 124. 124. MARTIN I want to show you something. Bring your drink. Leave the knife. Blomkvist's hope of getting out of here unscathed is pretty much gone now. He pulls the knife from his back pocket and sets it on a side table. 224 INT. VANGER ARCHIVES BUILDING - NIGHT 224 Salander strides past the napping night watchman without leaving the keys or bothering to tell him she's done. 225 EXT. VANGER ARCHIVES BUILDING - NIGHT 225 Crossing the empty parking lot, she tries Blomkvist on her cell. Gets his voice mail. Kick-starts her bike. 226 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 226 Martin "leads" Blomkvist from behind back to the kitchen, switching off lights as they go. MARTIN You know what's harder than shooting someone? Just missing them. That was a very good shot up at the cabin. BLOMKVIST It didn't work. I'm here. MARTIN Mikael, it did work. You're here. They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a door. MARTIN Open it. Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent tubes flicker on to reveal: A furnace. Washer. Dryer. Old discarded furniture. And another door. A steel one. As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and the lock on the steel door clicks. MARTIN Push it open. 227 INT. BASEMENT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS 227 As Blomkvist steps across the threshold - 125. 125. MARTIN Switch is on the left. Blomkvist flips it and a row of overhead fluorescent tubes flickers on - one after the other - revealing a subterranean torture chamber: Metal eyelets bolted to the concrete walls and ceiling and floor - table with leather straps - bed with leather straps - steel-mesh cage - work bench with handsaws and other tools - Blomkvist takes it in with one glance and immediately turns to try to smash the glass in his hand into Martin's face - which is covered now with a plastic oxygen mask he holds to it. Gas plumes down on Blomkvist from above; the glass comes out of his hand, shattering on the cement floor - 228 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT 228 The Honda's single headlight shudders as Salander comes across the bridge onto the island. 228A INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUED 228A Blomkvist comes to on the floor, handcuffed to a chain that runs through a metal eyelet. He sees Martin behind a video camera on a tripod, focusing it - a shelf full of Betamax tapes - and a TV monitor on which his own image then appears. Note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to notice - which we aren't - is not locked. It's not even completely shut. Satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest, Martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered in clear plastic. It squeaks. He regards Blomkvist calmly. Sips his drink. Then almost sighs. MARTIN Why didn't you just go home. BLOMKVIST I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed. Martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, Blomkvist's "easy" manner in this dire circumstance. MARTIN How'd you do it? What did you find? 126. 126. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait, and does. Then - MARTIN We can talk or we can just get on with it. It's really up to you. Nothing from Blomkvist. Martin shrugs `okay,' gets up, goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain from it. As he's laying it on the floor around his victim, Blomkvist changes his mind - BLOMKVIST I found a picture no one had seen before. MARTIN Of. BLOMKVIST You. In your Uppsala prep school blazer. Martin doesn't see the significance, but is pleased Blomkvist has decided to "participate." He rewards him by suspending his shower curtain work to return to the chair. It squeaks again. MARTIN What does that say? BLOMKVIST That you lied about where you were that day. Or rather when. MARTIN Did I? If I did, so what. People lie all the time. BLOMKVIST It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate. MARTIN Lena ... (he has to think back to remember her) Lena was a long time ago. (pause) Where's this picture now? With all the other junk on your desk? BLOMKVIST A print is. Digital copies are on a secure photo site. 127. 127. MARTIN That's a lie ... How much does the girl know? Blomkvist isn't sure how to play that question ... MARTIN Let's hope it's as much as you. That'll make it more fun. Where is she? BLOMKVIST Stockholm. She went there this morning. MARTIN And that's a lie. She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth. I like that name. Lisbeth. When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives - He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when he was out cold. MARTIN I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me. 228B INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 228B As Salander gets the door open with her key and comes in - SALANDER Mikael - ? He's clearly not here. She goes to the closet. Takes out the surveillance PC. Puts it on the desk - next to Blomkvist's laptop which is now displaying - not the photo of Martin he left for her - but the Apple default "light spider" screen saver. As Salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the day - 229 INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUED 229 Martin reframes the video camera to include part of himself in the shot, sits again and crosses his leg like this is a talk show. 128. 128. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ MARTIN So what would you like to know? There are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist says nothing. MARTIN You're the journalist, ask me something. Nothing from Blomkvist. Which is okay with Martin; he can do this alone - MARTIN What do I do with my guests? Is that the question? Well, before - I do what we're doing. Relax, have a drink, converse. I like that part a lot - having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die. After - I simply get rid of them. Out to sea - (points off) - unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies. That's not smart if you ask me. That's just garish and loud. But he was a garish and loud man. Frankly, he got what he deserved. Nothing from Blomkvist, but he is wondering now what happened to Gottfried if the drowning wasn't accidental. MARTIN You can't be a sloppy technician like that. You can't drink to excess like he did. This takes discipline. It's a science of a thousand details. The planning. The execution. The cleanup. I'm sure I don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess. Nothing from Blomkvist, but Martin nods. ("How do you do this and still function in normal society?") MARTIN That's the interesting thing. Because most of the time I am just like everyone else. I just have a bigger secret. It's wonderful really - standing there waiting for a train - or on a street corner as people brush past me. You know what I mean; (MORE) 129. 129. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ MARTIN (CONT'D) you have secrets. You had one when you came up here. It made you feel - special. Didn't it? Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin is a little thrown by Blomkvist's next unspoken comment - ("Yes, but my secrets aren't rape and murder") MARTIN No. I'm not a rapist. Of course I do that too - and at one time it was enough - but - (gathers his thoughts to explain it) A rapist, Mikael, gets off on domination. I need ... (discards a few other words before:) - destruction. Martin gets up and sets about the business of immobilizing Blomkvist further with a block-and-tackle contraption of chains and straps. MARTIN Can I ask you something? Why don't people trust their instincts? They sense something's wrong - someone's walking too close behind them - yet they don't cross the street. You knew something was wrong - you even knew what it was - but you came back into the house. Did I force you? Did I grab you and drag you in? I just offered you a drink. (pause) You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain - but you know what? It is. They always come willingly. It amazes him. It always amazes him. He keeps working. MARTIN And then they're here. They know it's over like you do - and still somehow think they have a chance. "Maybe if I say the right thing - if I'm polite - or I cry and beg - maybe I'll survive." (regards Blomkvist) And then the moment comes when they realize ... no, all hope is gone. (MORE) 130. 130. MARTIN (CONT'D) And when that happens - when I see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now - (whispers like it's just between them) - well, I feel myself getting hard just watching it. Silence ... MARTIN Say something. BLOMKVIST You are a sick fuck. MARTIN ... Is this an interview or an editorial? Blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet Martin considers what the journalist hasn't said ... ("Martin, civilized people don't do what you do.") MARTIN You're right, this behavior is unacceptable. I know that. But we're not completely different. We both have desires. Satisfying mine just requires more towels. Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence. Then - MARTIN Anything else you want to know? (pause) You sure? (pause) All right. Whatever you say. He yanks a chain that feeds through the pulleys that lift Blomkvist up onto his feet - 230 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 230 Salander watches the surveillance images, forward - Blomkvist leaving the cottage and property on foot. Blomkvist returning to the cottage, going back inside. Blomkvist coming out and attempting a call on his cell. Blomkvist going back inside the cottage. Blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property. Blomkvist not coming back. Nothing but the sky darkening to night. Then - 131. 131. Headlights coming through frame. A figure appearing on foot at the front gate. The figure just standing there, looking at the cottage. The figure approaching it, and, as it's trying the locked front door, the motion detection light snapping on and illuminating Martin. Martin moving to the side, looking in a kitchen window, coming around front again, walking to the gate, turning around, looking back, then walking out of frame. 231 INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 231 Blomkvist hangs from the block-and-tackle rig, leather strap around his neck now, fed through a ceiling eyelet. With a big sewing scissors, Martin cuts through and removes Blomkvist's pants and underwear - MARTIN It might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and Liv - who, by the way, finds me very conventional - Irina was down here in the cage. Who's Irina, you ask? A girl I met in Belarus. Just another girl. Another immigrant whore. Who misses them? He returns to his work bench to lay out various tools next to his gun and a desk phone. BLOMKVIST Your sister wasn't just another girl. Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches the noose tighter around Blomkvist's neck as it lifts him onto his tiptoes. MARTIN What happened to her. BLOMKVIST You're choking me - MARTIN You found her? BLOMKVIST You killed her. Martin just stares at him confused. Then - MARTIN You useless fuckin detective. 132. 132. He lets go of the strap and Blomkvist's feet come back down to the floor. As Martin returns to his workbench, Blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now. Did Martin not kill her? Then Martin is back in front of him with a roll of cellophane, pulls on the strap again until Blomkvist is balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off. MARTIN Too tight to talk? It is. Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag. MARTIN Good. I'm tired of talking to you. He wraps Blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches him struggle. ... MARTIN Would you like me to do something about that? Blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate. Martin watches another several moments ... then pokes a finger through the cellophane into Blomkvist's gasping mouth. MARTIN See? I'm not a monster. He frames a wide shot of his naked prey. Turns on some music. Takes a moment to collect himself from all this strenuous work. Brushes back his hair like he wants to look presentable in the shot. Then smiles pleasantly - MARTIN You know, I've never had a man in here. I've never touched a man as a matter of fact. Except my father, of course. But that was my duty. Harriet's, too. The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by the strap. His fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose, but can't get a grip. Martin watches the struggle calmly, and just as calmly offers: MARTIN It's time. I don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend. 133. 133. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ He puts on a plastic rain poncho. A painter's mask. Plastic goggles. Surgeons gloves. Picks up a hunting knife. Steps up to Blomkvist. Looks at his eyes. Brings his own head close to his victim's - MARTIN Goodbye, Mikael. He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the floor, closing off his air again ... and is about to gut him like a wild boar ... when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him ... He turns and sees her - coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door - He darts for the gun he left on the workbench - Salander just as quickly swings a 5-iron - his 5-iron - like a baseball bat. Its metal-wedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending him tumbling to the floor. He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor. She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket. Grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness - She saws through the leather strap around his neck. Unlocks the chain. As he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her - Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet. But he's not coming at them; he's trying to get out - Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look. Lifts a hand to try to point. She turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door. Looks back at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission - SALANDER May I kill him? Nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a thing - until now. Now it's as if her years of violence and degradation have been passed to him. He nods. 134. 134. She puts the hunting knife in his hand. Pulls the gun from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the safety, and turns to leave - BLOMKVIST He has more guns in the den - SALANDER I know. She comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun. Distant thunder rumbles. She crosses through the kitchen to the living room, and down the hall to the study. She eases around the doorway - the room is empty - looks to the gun case - sees there are only two rifles there now. She hears an engine start outside. Hurries back through the house. Sees out the picture window the taillights of Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst. She bangs out the front door. Runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps on and kick-starts it. 232 EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT 232 She roars onto the bridge, chasing the taillights. Guns the bike to full throttle. Comes alongside him. He swerves to try to crush her against the railing - but she hits the brakes, avoiding the impact - She accelerates again and comes up on the other side of the car. He swerves again at her, but this time the bike pulls ahead of him. Now he's chasing her - He gains on her as they near the end of the bridge. As they race off it, he goes in for the kill, but she veers hard to one side, leaving him headed straight for the gas station Blomkvist makes his pay phone calls from - and the tanker truck parked there - Martin hits the brakes - hydroplanes into the truck - and its, or his own tank, or both, explode - Salander circles back. Regards the fire engulfing the car. The rain does nothing to dampen it. She could probably brave it to pull Martin out - but doesn't. As the flames burn his clothes, he manages to get his hands on the rifle he took from the den, turns its barrel to his bloody head - but before he can pull the trigger, she hurries over, yanks it from his grasp and stands back again. It's much more cathartic to watch him burn ... 135. 135. 233 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT 233 She finds Blomkvist in the living room. Sitting in a chair, his coat wrapped around him. The hunting knife in his hand. Distant sirens echo. He can still just barely manage to speak - BLOMKVIST Where is he? SALANDER Dead. 234 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN 234 Reminiscent of the last photographs taken on the Hedeby Island bridge forty years ago, police and firemen finish up at the crash site. A winch drags Martin's charred black wreck of a car onto a tow truck. 235 INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - MORNING 235 Blomkvist is asleep in the bedroom with what looks like a neck tattoo - the black and blue mark left by Martin's noose that nearly strangled him to death. He doesn't hear the knock at the front door, nor - SALANDER O/S It's open. Frode comes into the cottage looking shaken. Salander is the picture of calm, drinking a cup of black coffee. FRODE Where's Mikael? SALANDER Asleep. Coffee? There's no milk. Frode absently shakes his head no. FRODE I have some very upsetting news. Martin was killed in a car accident last night. SALANDER Sad. Frode isn't sure he heard right. Regards Salander sipping her coffee. FRODE What? 136. 136. SALANDER I said it's sad. FRODE (pause) What do you know about this? She doesn't say any more. Frode gets up and starts toward the bedroom - FRODE I have to talk to (Mikael) - SALANDER Let him sleep. It's not a request; it's a command. 236 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - MORNING 236 Frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder Salander brought from Martin's chamber of horrors late last night: A scrapbook of murder. A death book. Photos of women cowering in his cage, tied to the bed, dead on the table - along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of hair - all carefully taped into the `album.' The older photographs are Polaroids; the newer ones digital prints. With little to no discernible emotion, Salander watches Frode wince as he turns the pages. Frode can't take it anymore. Closes the book before reaching the end. Just sits there. FRODE What are we going to do? SALANDER We're going home, Mikael and me. I don't know what you're going to do. FRODE I'm going to the police. SALANDER Show them the videos while you're at it. FRODE The - Salander points to a stack of video tapes. 137. 137. SALANDER Would you like to see them? FRODE No. 236A INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - LATER - MORNING 236A Blomkvist half-wakes to find Salander lying next to him, fully-clothed, watching him. Is she actually there, or part of a dream? He looks at her a long moment, then tries out his voice - BLOMKVIST How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state? SALANDER I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life. He smiles, thinking it's joke. It isn't, he realizes. BLOMKVIST Since when have they said that. SALANDER Since I was twelve. BLOMKVIST Something happened when you were twelve? She doesn't say. Just studies him ... BLOMKVIST It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything - SALANDER I tried to kill my father. I burned him alive. Got about 80 percent of him. BLOMKVIST (pause) Oh. Silence. Then - SALANDER We need milk. 237 OMIT - EXT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAY 237 138. 138. 238 INT. COTTAGE - DAY 238 She pours milk in her coffee from the carton she just bought. Pushes over two faded Polaroid photos. He picks them up: One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up, head turned half-away from the camera. The second shows her on her stomach on a bed, completely naked, face turned to the photographer, frightened. BLOMKVIST Harriet? SALANDER I think so. Blomkvist can't look at the photos long. Sets them down. Something's troubling him - BLOMKVIST Martin didn't deny killing anyone. But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused. He was angry - at me - for not being able to tell him what happened to her. (pause) He didn't kill her. And his father was dead the year before. (pause) What if she did somehow get away? Could she have done that? Could she have done it alone? He goes up to his wall of suspects. BLOMKVIST Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is. He takes the photo of Anita down from the wall. 239 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 239 Henrik sits in one of the chairs. Blomkvist in another. Salander prefers to stand. Eventually - VANGER Poor Martin. Clearly, he hasn't been shown the death book, or been told the tale of Blomkvist's night in Martin's dungeon. 139. 139. BLOMKVIST I have to go away for a couple days. When I come back, I hope to have an answer for you. Such a possibility stuns the old man. He regards Blomkvist a moment. Then Salander ... VANGER Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy. BLOMKVIST She's my partner, Henrik. She should stay. A tiny, tiny, tiny smile finds its way to her face at the mention of the word `partner.' VANGER What have you found? BLOMKVIST I'm not sure. VANGER Don't treat me like a child. Tell me. BLOMKVIST I can't. I don't know. I need a week. Vanger studies him. Then - VANGER I've waited forty years. I can wait another week. 240 INT. AIRLINE - IN FLIGHT - DAY 240 Blomkvist and Salander read magazines in a pair of coach seats. Across the aisle - occupying two seats - is one 300-lb. sleeping figure: Plague. 241 INT. PUB - LONDON - DUSK 241 They drink pints in an unpopular, almost-empty pub. A Cure song plays. BLOMKVIST I always liked this song. (nothing from her or Plague) You don't? 140. 140. SALANDER I don't like classical music. A strange-looking young man comes in, regards the strange- looking trio at the table, comes over. To the fat man - TRINITY Plague? PLAGUE Trinity. SALANDER Wasp. Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will. BLOMKVIST ... Mikael. Trinity sits. None of these people have much experience with human interaction. They all look at Blomkvist, but he isn't sure why. SALANDER The money. Blomkvist takes an envelope from his jacket, hands it to Trinity. He begins counting it - 242 EXT. LONDON - NIGHT 242 Alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic components he doesn't understand, Blomkvist anxiously stares out a tinted window at a dark row house. Headlights flare down the street. An approaching car. He hopes it passes, but it instead pulls up to the garage - waits for the door to go up - pulls in. BLOMKVIST Fuck me. He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car - the garage door come down - light go on inside the house - then dark figures hurrying along the side of the house: Trinity, Salander, and finally Plague. They climb into the van with their tools, firewires, a laptop. None speaks as they tether cables to computers in the van. Blomkvist just watches. Finally, to him - SALANDER It's your turn. 141. 141. 243 EXT. ANITA'S HOUSE - LONDON - NIGHT 243 Blomkvist knocks on the door. Anita pulls it open. BLOMKVIST It's me. Sorry to bother you. She doesn't invite him in, but doesn't shut the door in his face either. ANITA What do you want? BLOMKVIST No one's called you? ANITA About. BLOMKVIST Your cousin. She has two, but doesn't ask which - BLOMKVIST Martin. ANITA What about him? BLOMKVIST He died last Thursday. A car accident. I'm sorry. (nothing from her) There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad. I know you haven't been back there in a long time, but - ANITA I'm not interested in any memorial. BLOMKVIST I understand. ANITA What do you understand? BLOMKVIST That you don't really care for any of your relatives. Still, I thought you should know. ANITA Now I know. And now, she closes the door. 142. 142. 244 OMIT: INT. ANITA'S HOUSE - LONDON - NIGHT 244 245 EXT. ANITA'S HOUSE - LONDON - NIGHT 245 Blomkvist returns to the van. Climbs in. SALANDER How'd it go? BLOMKVIST Okay. I think. He sits and watches them monitor the phone and computer taps they installed earlier. One of the laptops, without anyone touching it, blinks on to a Google screen. TRINITY She's on. A screen name and password characters on a Gmail page type themselves. They expect her to go to "Compose," but she opens one of the messages - spam - deletes it - marks a couple more and banishes them as well. The only new thing left in the inbox is an eBay alert. Clicking it takes her to an auction for a triple-strand faux-pearl Jackie O necklace: 49 pounds. The cursor clicks the Buy-It-Now button. As the screen switches to Anita's Paypal account, Blomkvist and Salander exchange a confused glance. 246 OMIT: INT. HOTEL - LONDON - NIGHT 246 246A INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - LATER - NIGHT 246A Salander's laptop is monitoring Anita's computer, her hard-line phone and cell. Blomkvist emerges from the bathroom, rests a hand on Salander's shoulder to peer over it at the screen: In one of the windows, cards are dealing themselves. BLOMKVIST She's playing solitaire? (Salander nods) And she still hasn't called anyone. SALANDER No. BLOMKVIST Do we have her cell, too? Salander points to one of the windows on the screen. His hand comes off her shoulder. 143. 143. BLOMKVIST I was so she'd lead us to her. SALANDER Put your hand back on my shoulder. He does. They watch the solitaire game together ... SALANDER There's only one reason she wouldn't call Harriet. She can't because Harriet is indeed dead. 247 INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - LATER - NIGHT 247 It's strange perhaps, but he does some of his best thinking during sex - BLOMKVIST I was just thinking. What if - SALANDER Ten more seconds. That's fair. She finishes. They lie there. Then - SALANDER Okay, what. BLOMKVIST I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility. 248 OMIT: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT 248 249 INT. INVESTMENT BANK - LONDON - DAY 249 Blomkvist taps on Anita's open office door. BLOMKVIST May I? ANITA What is it now. He comes in and sits. BLOMKVIST I want to show you something. He tugs his shirt collar low enough to reveal the black and blue "tattoo" around his neck. Anita is taken aback by the sight. It's hard to imagine how anyone would end up with a mark like that. 144. 144. BLOMKVIST Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook ... Harriet. 250 EXT. PARK - LONDON - DAY 250 They sit together on a park bench. BLOMKVIST Anita married in Stockholm in 1967. It's recorded in the Swedish General Register. But the family never knew, did they. (she confirms that with a shake of her head) I'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport. HARRIET Actually, it was the other way around. She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself. BLOMKVIST What did he think about that? HARRIET Nothing. Only that he loved her. She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why. He never did. BLOMKVIST They both died twenty years ago. HARRIET A car accident. You found that, too. Blomkvist nods, reaches for something in his jacket pocket - changes his mind - changes it again and pulls it out. BLOMKVIST Is this you? He hands her the less graphic of the two Polaroids Salander found in Martin's basement - the young girl, face turned half-away from the camera ... HARRIET I was 14 the first time he raped me. BLOMKVIST Martin. 145. 145. HARRIET No, my father. He took this picture. Martin didn't start until he died. Blomkvist can't hide his horror even after all he's seen. BLOMKVIST Why didn't you tell someone? HARRIET I did. My mother. Blomkvist stares. Finally - BLOMKVIST Henrik would have done something. HARRIET Would he? I don't know. I almost told him. But I was afraid because of what I did. (pause) You still don't understand? He doesn't. She studies him, and perhaps sees in him what Salander did long ago - that he can be trusted. HARRIET A year after the first time - after many times during that year - my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed. He quoted from the Bible as he tore off my clothes. He wrapped a belt around my neck. He wanted to kill me. 251 EXT. GOTTFRIED'S CABIN - NIGHT - 1965 251 Harriet makes it out of the cabin in torn clothing, trying to get the belt around her neck off. Her father can heard inside ranting something from the Bible. HARRIET V/O I made it out of the house and down to the dock. He came staggering after me - Gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the hill in pursuit of his almost-naked daughter. HARRIET V/O I could never fight him off in a small room, but I was strong enough out in the open to deal with an old drunk. 146. 146. As he comes onto the dock, she waits for the moment, and smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar. It stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water. He surfaces, reaches for the dock planks. As he takes hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head like an axe. He stares up her, uncomprehending. His fingers slide away from the dock. His body goes limp and sinks out of sight beneath the water. HARRIET V/O When it was finally over I looked up, and Martin was standing there - She sees her brother up by the cabin looking down at her. HARRIET V/O With a little smile. 252 EXT. PARK - LONDON - DAY 252 HARRIET He dragged me back to the cabin ... All I'd accomplished was substitute one rapist for another. 253 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY - 1966 253 Young Harriet and her school friends walk along the town's main street past crowds lining it, and we realize we're seeing what we've only seen in still photographs. HARRIET V/O A couple months later, Henrik sent him off to school in Uppsala. And I thought maybe - maybe - the nightmare was over. Until that day. The float with the harem girls comes past, and we watch the smile on young Harriet's face change to fear as she notices something off to the left. HARRIET V/O There he was - across the street - looking at me with that same little smile on his face. A clear shot of young Martin in his Uppsala blazer, standing by the corner, smiling at her. HARRIET V/O It wasn't over. 147. 147. 254 EXT. PARK - LONDON - CONTINUED 254 BLOMKVIST How'd you get away? Anita? 255 INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966 255 Anita, framed in the bedroom window - like in the photograph - looks out at the activity on the bridge. Behind her, Harriet packs a few items of clothing. ANITA Don't take anything. Harriet puts the clothes back. Picks up her purse. ANITA Leave that, too. 256 INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966 256 The dinner that night. Vanger noticing Harriet's empty chair. And Anita saying nothing, taking a bite of food. 257 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1966 257 The searchers scouring the island. The boats moving along the shoreline. The crane lifting the truck from the bridge. Anita climbs into her car outside her father Harald's house. Drives down the road toward the bridge. ANITA Stay absolutely still. The blanket covering Harriet on the backseat floorboard moves slightly, then is still. A policeman on the island side of the bridge waves the car across it. As it heads along the mainland service road toward the highway - HARRIET V/O She saved me. 258 EXT. PARK - LONDON - DAY 258 Silence. Then she gestures to Blomkvist's neck. HARRIET How did you get away? BLOMKVIST Someone saved me, too. 148. 148. He gestures off to the thin, strange girl sitting on another park bench too far away to hear them. Harriet does something she hasn't done since they met: smile. 259 EXT. VANGER MANOR - DAY - ESTABLISH 259 259A INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY 259A Blomkvist, Salander and Frode wait in Vanger's study. A tea service tray sits there untouched like the first time Blomkvist came here. Anna pushes a wheelchair into the room with Vanger in it. There's a file on his lap. BLOMKVIST How are you feeling? VANGER I'm fine. Thank you, Anna. Anna leaves. Closes the doors. Before Blomkvist can say anything else - VANGER I made you a promise. Whether you found out anything or not. He holds out the file. Blomkvist takes it and sees: INSERT: Wennerstorm's name typed on it, and a fairly recent photo of him clipped to it. VANGER Now. What do you have to tell me. 259B EXT. VANGER MANOR - DAY 259B A car pulls up the drive. Parks. The back door opens. Harriet climbs out. Looks at the manor. Then walks toward the front door - 260 INT. VANGER MANOR - MOMENTS LATER 260 Vanger propels his wheelchair down the main hall, but stops when he sees Harriet coming in the front door with Anna. He stares, trying to reconcile how she looks now compared to when he last saw her, or maybe to convince himself she's really alive. She sees him ... HARRIET Hi, Henrik. He begins to weep. She walks to him and places a hand on his hunched shaking shoulders. Frode, Blomkvist and Salander watch. One of them isn't particularly moved. 261 OMIT - INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY 261 149. 149. 261A INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAY 261A As Frode leafs through the file that Blomkvist has already read - FRODE ... I don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired ... BLOMKVIST Why would you. It was a long time ago. Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled. FRODE I don't think I'm seeing the point. BLOMKVIST Yes, you are. FRODE (another look at the paperwork) It happened in the 1970's ... Salander watches the two men from across the room ... FRODE (ADR) (regarding the documents) I swear I didn't know this was what Henrik had on him. If I had, I never would have let him bring you up here. But he wasn't trying to deceive you. BLOMKVIST Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later. I like Henrik, but he knows that. Frode disagrees - FRODE A man's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that. I'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion. BLOMKVIST The "court of public opinion," Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop. Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this. 150. 150. FRODE Of course you're right ... (pause) I'm sorry. 262 EXT. VANGER MANOR - LATER - DAY 262 Blomkvist and Salander sit out by the water, sharing the last cigarette in his pack. Her arm is draped over his shoulder, which strikes him as the most tender of gestures, coming from her. SALANDER Fuck these people ... BLOMKVIST Yeah ... SALANDER Harriet most of all. BLOMKVIST Excuse me? SALANDER If she'd done anything but run, Martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women. BLOMKVIST She had no idea he was doing it. SALANDER She should have killed her father and him. BLOMKVIST That's what you would've done. Not everyone's you. She's not sure she likes the comment. Decides she doesn't. Takes her arm away from his shoulder. BLOMKVIST That was meant to be a compliment. Put your arm back on my shoulder. She doesn't. So he drapes his on hers. Then - SALANDER What happened with Wennerstrom. How did he get you? 151. 151. BLOMKVIST I was stupid. I got something from an anonymous source, who I'm sure now worked for him. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court. Not a good day, that. Then - SALANDER You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom? He regards her, uncertain what she means ... SALANDER I started investigating him on my own. Then you showed up and hired me. I haven't had a chance to look at it all - you and Harriet-fucking- Vanger have kept me busy ... but I may have something. BLOMKVIST (pause) On Wennerstrom. She nods. Then rests her head on his shoulder. 263 OMIT: EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DUSK 263 264 INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - MORNING 264 A new family tree on a wall here, more complicated than the Vanger's: The Wennerstrom Group, made up of dozens of companies in cities worldwide. As Erika looks at it - BLOMKVIST Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are. The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao. These companies produce no products and provide no services. They're shells. They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money - which accounts for all but 5-percent of his holdings - ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. It's a completely illegal, criminal empire. ERIKA How do you know this? 152. 152. BLOMKVIST This time you don't want to know. ERIKA This time I do want to know. BLOMKVIST I have access to his computer, and his accountants' and lawyers'. She isn't happy to hear that explanation. ERIKA And how do you have that? BLOMKVIST I could have gotten it from a source inside the company. ERIKA But you didn't. BLOMKVIST But that's what you'll say. ERIKA But what will you say to me? BLOMKVIST That depends on if you really want to know. ERIKA I do. Who gave you access? What looks like 16-year-old tattooed runaway lets herself in with her own key. Crosses past Erika with a paper bag, takes out two bagel sandwiches, the same kind Blomkvist brought when he barged into her apartment. As she puts some water on for coffee, Erika looks at Blomkvist. He nods. Yeah. Her. 265 TV NEWS: 265 ANNOUNCER Journalist Mikael Blomkvist - who this time last year was convicted of libel in a Stockholm courtroom - doesn't seem to have learned from that experience. Or maybe he has - 266 INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 266 The report continues on a TV in Blomkvist's bedroom - 153. 153. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ ANNOUNCER In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the same company that successfully sued him - The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal activities on a global scale - backing it up with internal financial reports, bank records and emails - annotations almost as long as the article itself. The cover of the magazine features a head shot of Wennerstrom, and, rare for the magazine, a tabloid-style title: GANGLAND. Salander leafs through the article as Blomkvist brushes his teeth in the bathroom. BLOMKVIST He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work. FI can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this. The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff. They'll both have to investigate. SALANDER Then. BLOMKVIST We'll be back in court, but this time it'll cost him. That's probably it, though. These guys never to prison. Salander nods, but it's not really in agreement. Or maybe it is. In any case, she's not as enthused about all this as he is. BLOMKVIST What's wrong. SALANDER It's embarrassing. BLOMKVIST What. SALANDER I need to borrow some money. Blomkvist grins and reaches for his wallet. 154. 154. SALANDER 50,000. His grin stays stitched to his face a moment, then unravels. He puts his wallet away. SALANDER I have a chance to make an investment. It's a smart, safe investment. BLOMKVIST I don't know that I have that much. SALANDER You do. I'm sorry that I know that. You have 65 thousand in your two accounts. He's no longer shocked or dismayed by her knowing more about his personal affairs than he does. SALANDER You'll get the money back. I promise. 267 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY 267 Several pages torn from pages of fashion magazines: Models - all of them blonde - their beautiful faces - designer clothes - accessories - make-up tips. Applying makeup to the wasp tattoo on her neck and the "handcuffs" on her wrists, Salander pays no attention to the TV showing Wennerstrom under an umbrella, interviewed outside the building that bears his name - WENNERSTROM These allegations - like the last ones from this so-called journalist - are as ridiculous as they are untrue - 268 EXT/INT. CLOTHING STORE - STOCKHOLM - DAY 268 Salander purchases with cash expensive designer clothes she normally wouldn't be caught dead in. WENNERSTROM I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again. I'm looking forward to it. 269 EXT/INT. LUGGAGE SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY 269 Here she's buying a high-end carry-on valise and portfolio briefcase. 155. 155. REPORTER What about his documentation? WENNERSTROM Fabricated. All of it. 270 EXT/INT. WIG SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY 270 Good wigs cost money - like the shoulder-length blonde one atop a black Lucite head Salander is purchasing. ANNOUNCER The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerstrom of that. 271 EXT/INT. SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY 271 A place that caters to transvestites who, among other things, require as Salander does, latex breasts. FSA OFFICIAL If even a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist is alleging proves to be true, not only will there be a securities investigation, but an organized crime inquiry as well. 272 EXT/INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY 272 Wearing the wig and a designer outfit she takes her own passport photo against a wall. She looks like Erika. REPORTER Mr. Blomkvist names no sources. FSA OFFICIAL And we can't force him to. But we can look for them. REPORTER Beginning where? FSA OFFICIAL Beginning with those closest to Mr. Wennerstrom. Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this could have access to this kind of information. 273 INT. PLAGUE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 273 Not wearing the wig now, she inspects a passport Plague has acquired for her featuring the crown of Norway, and some credit cards. 156. 156. On his TV, a pack of lawyers stand where Wennerstrom was standing before - outside the Group's corporate offices - under, as usual, umbrellas - LAWYER Mr. Wennerstrom isn't available for comment today, but as his legal counsel, I'd be happy to answer your questions. REPORTER Where is he? LAWYER At home, I imagine. REPORTER He isn't. Has he left the country? LAWYER I don't think so. 274 EXT. ZURICH - DAY 274 A plane touches down on a Zurich Airport runway. 275 INT. ZURICH AIRPORT - DAY 275 A customs official, satisfied with "Irene Nesser's" Norwegian passport - not to mention her blonde hair and bustline - stamps a page. 276 EXT.

ZIMMERSTAL HOTEL - ZURICH - DAY 277 As a desk clerk photocopies Ms. Nesser's passport, she neither hides from nor plays to the security camera. 278 INT. SUITE - ZIMMERSTAHL - EVENING 278 Salander emerges from the bathroom without the wig on. Crosses through the suite in her underwear. Oddly - or perhaps not - she's also wearing a pair of white gloves. She opens the balcony's doors to let in some air. On the TV: ANNOUNCER With his failure to appear before a Security Exchange Commission panel, a warrant has been issued for The Wennerstrom Group CEO. 157. 157. An immigration official appears before the news cameras - IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL I can confirm that he left Sweden on a private jet that landed in Paris last week, but whether he's still there, we don't know. He could be anywhere by now. She sips at her room service coffee. 279 EXT. ZURICH - DAY 279 "Irene Nesser" enters Bank Hausen General under watchful security cameras. 280 INT. BANK HAUSEN GENERAL - ZURICH - DAY 280 Security cameras inside watch her and a banker at a desk in an area reserved for discreet transactions. SALANDER I have a number of accounts at Bank of Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands. I want to transfer those funds and convert them to bonds. As she writes an account number on a slip of paper from memory, Herr Wagner notices - as she intends - the pen she's using - from the venerable Zimmerstal Hotel. WAGNER Naturally, you have the clearing codes. SALANDER Naturally. WAGNER How many accounts will you be transferring? SALANDER Thirty. He glances at his watch, perhaps thinking about lunch. His faux-politeness - even his appearance - reminds her of Bjurman. WAGNER This will take some time. SALANDER For which you'll receive a 4-percent commission. 158. 158. WAGNER I will. SALANDER Then it won't be a waste of it. She offers him the Zimmerstal pen. WAGNER Thank you, I have one. He picks up one of his cheap pens. She hands him a long list of account numbers and clearing codes - 281 INT. SUITE - ZIMMERSTAL HOTEL - ZURICH - DAY 281 As she sorts through a stack of bonds, the TV shows a reporter in a colorful town square. REPORTER A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados says he knows where fugitive financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom is: Here in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown. Police released this photograph, taken yesterday by the tourist, Jens Assur - A snapshot of Wennerstrom, or someone who looks like him - tropical shirt, hat and sunglasses - climbing into a car. REPORTER - and say they believe it is the disgraced billionaire. 282 INT. BANK DORFMANN - ZURICH - DAY 282 Sitting with a different bank manager now as security cameras keep silent watch, she opens her portfolio and turns it so he can see its contents. He glances up with a polite smile that's supposed to mask his surprise. HASSELMAN How many of these would you like to convert for deposit? SALANDER All fifty. Into five accounts. He works out the conversion to CHF and hands her the calculator: A "2" followed by more digits than we can count. SALANDER That looks correct. 159. 159. 283 INT. SUITE - ZIMMERSTAL HOTEL - EVENING 283 The remnants of a McDonald's kids meal on the desk with the wig and white gloves. She bypasses the hotel's internet service, uplinks her MacBook through her cell. Five accounts - the ones she just established at Bank Dorfrmann - appear on the screen. She transfers all the funds into one account at Bank Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands, belonging to a Gibraltar company. A284 EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT - DAY - ESTABLISHING A284 284 INT.

Necklace falls to the bottom of a paper towel bin. 288 EXT. OSLO TRAIN STATION - DAY 288 Irene/Salander puts her empty portfolio in an unlocked locker, wipes the prints from it, heads for the platform. 289 INT. TRAIN - MOVING - EVENING 289 She has a private sleeping berth, but isn't sleeping. She's smoking a cigarette next to a No-Smoking decal on the window that's cracked open, and tosses the Zimmerstal Hotel pen out to the darkening countryside rushing past. 290 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 290 Salander - looking like Salander - enters her apartment with only her laptop bag. Holds Irene's passport over a stove flame. Sets the burning document on a plate. Takes a Coke from her fridge, sits with it. Puts the cold can to her forehead like a compress. Then opens it, drinks, and closes her eyes ... 160. 160. 290A EXT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 290A A dark figure is looking up at her apartment, at television light playing on a window. As he walks off into the night, we see it's Bjurman. ZURICH REPORTER O/S The man who is now being called Sweden's Pablo Escobar, may not have a country to call home, but does have enough money to buy one. 291 EXT. ZURICH - DAY 291 The reporter stands under an umbrella on the same street Salander crossed to get from one hotel to the other. ZURICH REPORTER According to the International Banking Commission, Wennerstrom, just days after the Millennium article that brought him down appeared on news stands, began emptying accounts at Bank of Kroenfeld in the Cayman Islands. 292 OMIT: EXT. STOCKHOLM - EVENING 292 293 INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - EVENING 293 The place is trimmed with Christmas decorations again. In a glassed-in conference room, Blomkvist, Erika, and a few others sit around the table, their production meeting interrupted by the news on the plasma TV here: ZURICH REPORTER ON TV That money, approximately two billion Euros, was then spread over a number of accounts with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich - Security camera images of "Irene Nesser," entering and leaving banks. ZURICH REPORTER ON TV - who converted the funds into private bonds, which, I'm told, are even harder to trace than Wennerstrom himself. Europol has launched a search for the woman who had used a stolen Norwegian passport. Her whereabouts, like her boss's, are unknown. 161. 161. 293A EXT. STOCKHOLM - EVENING - SAME TIME 293A Her whereabouts are here, roaring through Stockholm on her Honda like the first time we saw her. 293B INT.

PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - DAY 294 While the nurse fills a plastic days-of-the-week container with a concoction of pills, Salander sits with her Palmgren by the untouched chess table. SALANDER Can you hear me? (no indication that he can) I miss our meetings. (pause) I'm sure you don't. Why would you? I was always such a headache for you. Never showing up with good news. Only problems. (pause) I have some good news now. I've made a friend. I mean one that you'd approve of. (pause) I'm happy. One of Palmgren's hands manages to pull slightly away from the other, tries to reach for her, perhaps, but only makes it about an inch. She reaches over and holds it. 295 EXT. SPAIN - DAY 295 A reporter bundled-up outside a low-rent building cordoned off with police tape - REPORTER Behind the walls of this dingy rooming house behind me lies a body in a pool of blood - A man who has been living here the last three weeks under the name Victor Fleming - 295A EXT. CAFE - STOCKHOLM - DAY 295A The same cafe Blomkvist retreated to after his libel conviction. REPORTER O/S A man who police in Marbella, Spain, have confirmed is fugitive Hans-Erik Wennerstrom - 163. 163. 295B INT. CAFE - STOCKHOLM - DAY 295B Blomkvist is at the counter, across from a barista, but his attention is on the TV - REPORTER ON TV - shot three times in the head at close range in what is being called a classic gangland execution. BARISTA What would you like? Blomkvist glances blankly at the barista, then back to the TV - REPORTER ON TV The investigation into Wennerstrom's ties to crime organizations worldwide will now turn to speculation: Which of them caught up with him before Swedish authorities could? BARISTA Sir? REPORTER ON TV Wennerstrom spent the last days of his flamboyant life in solitude and anonymity, locked behind the door of Room 3A - BLOMKVIST ... Coffee and a sandwich ... that one. REPORTER ON TV Indeed, after checking in, he was never seen again - until this morning when the building manager came calling to collect the unpaid bill - 296 INT. TAILOR SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY 296 A tailor brings out a garment bag bearing his exclusive insignia, drapes it across a table, returns to Salander the photograph she provided him with last week: It's of a much younger Blomkvist - at about Salander's age now - wearing the black leather jacket he loved and lost track of years ago. The tailor unzips the bag revealing an exact - though considerably more expensive - replica of the jacket. 164. 164. SALANDER It's perfect. TAILOR Your father? SALANDER A friend. TAILOR Must be a very good friend. (she nods) He's lucky. 297 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DUSK 297 A perfect Christmas card vista that actually turns out to be a Christmas card: A snowy rural landscape scene. It's stupid, but she's writing under the pre-printed "Merry Christmas" inside, a personal note that's more sincere than she thought herself capable. She blows on the ink, puts the card in its envelope, neatly writes "Mikael" on it, gets up - 298 EXT. STOCKHOLM - EVENING 298 Snow's falling, but unlike the brutal winter storms last year, it's just heavy enough to dust the city in white powder that reflects the Christmas lights in the trees. The beauty of her city pleases Salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle. Or maybe it's something she's feeling as she turns onto Blomkvist's street. She parks. Gathers the garment bag and card, walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building. From around the corner ahead, Blomkvist and Erika appear. He says something and she laughs, puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf. Salander stops mid-stride, ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building, then peers out again - They're not inside. They've stopped just outside the building's entrance. They're embracing. And the longer they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at Salander. Finally they separate, but only to allow Blomkvist to unlock the door. Erika takes his hand then, and they disappear inside. 165. 165. Salander can't move. Waits for the pain to subside - which it eventually does - but only to be replaced with a sense of helplessness. Then that subsides, replaced with a facade of insouciance. The richest girl in Sweden emerges from the alcove and walks back the way she came - tossing the garment bag and card into a construction dumpster - climbs onto her Honda - starts it - and drives off - Probably forever.

                         FADE IN:

                         BEFORE TITLES:
          The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a
          single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes
          faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow
          streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now,
          confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us
          and another, and as our surroundings become more
          visible, we discover that we are moving through a
          pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,.
          suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves
          on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.

          It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen
          Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at
          lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move
          toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past
          the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard
          dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main
          house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by
          a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named
          Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly.
          As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the
          car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom
          Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business
          suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house
          and looks off.

          HAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE
          Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,.
          Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten. The boy, dressed
          for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to-
          ward us.

          REVERSE ANGLE - ON TONY
           As he looks out at the lake we might sense that he
           is troubled and puzzled, although he is managing to
           keep his expression stoic. Hagen can be seen in the
          background, by the house 9 After a moment:

                         (THEN)
          Time to go.
          There is a beat and Tony composes himself, turns and
          moves up toward the house and Tom Hagen.

          EXT. FRONT OF TAEOE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - DAY

          The heavy, black sedan is loaded. Connie Corleane
          and a Housekeeper, in uniform, are bringing Mary,
          about five, out to the car. She too is dressed for
          travelling. As they put her into the car --

                         CONNIE
          In you get ---

                         MARY

                         HAGEN
          No. Ere wanted me to tell you both
          how sorry he was.

                         TONY

                         (TO CONNIE)
          Aunt Connie ..- ?
          Connie would apparently prefer to avoid answering any
          questions.

                         CONNIE
          8e sure and give my love to your
          mother.

                         NERI

          I' 11 bet we' 11 all. be together
          for Christmas. Wait and see.
          Tony gems into the car. He locks out the window to--
          ward the house. We begin XXI-N Ti. TZS 2 C 2=17"s

                         TEE DRIVEWAY
          Hagen is the last one into the car. As it starts down
          the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie,
          Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave. The auto-
          matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens. The
          Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine
          passes through.
          TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE
          As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going
          back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up-
          ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in.
          Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one
          hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine,
          his expression unreadable-but somehow sad.

          ZNT. AIRLMPR - DAY
          We are close on Tony, looking out the window of the

          Under its fanlight, the front door swings open and

          We are close on a young man, Anthony Adams (Corleone),
          in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy
          at Annapolis. We are pulling back as the speaker --
          who is Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of State --
          continues, his accent faintly Scandinavian.

           CRUNDELLIUS' VOICE
          -- there are no limits to the goals
          to which we can each legitimately
          aspire. And now, as an unpopular war
          is ended in East Asia and we set our
          sights on new goals, I leave you with
          the words of another Sailor ---
          We continue to pull back to discover that we are at
          the Navy and Marine Corps stadium. It is a late Spring
          day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies. The
          Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered
          for- the graduation ceremonies.

          We pan off the motto to pick up Palnateer and Tony
          as they move through the great, columned rcom toward
          the desk at the end. The Guard at the desk, seeing
          Paimateer' s identification, signals h 1m and Tony up

          Hagen moves to Danny DeVito.

          The blood of our martyrs is still
          too fresh on our pavement. We will
          be friends and neighbors, but never
          again slaves to Imperialism.

          A young Latino, and we will recognize him as Ar=igo,
          has moved to Tony's side. As the cheers have erupted
          once more, Amigo, with'a brief nod of the head, indic-
          ates that Tony shouldfol:ow him.

          As Arrigo goes, Tony looks after him briefly, then over
          to the American Delegation including Lucas, the Assistant
          Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs; Cariock,
          the Speaker of the House and several prominent liberal
          Senators including McKissick of Utah and the elegant
          Harthaiemew of Pennsylvania.
          Also in the delegation, in uniform, is Stu Palmateer.
          The older man's eyes meet with Tony's for a brief
          moment. He has seen the exchange. He watches as
          Tony leaves, then looks over toward u_agudo, Vidal's

                         I
          Chief of Police. The harsh, heavy Policeman is laugh-
          1 ing at something Vidal has said, seemingly paying no
          attention to Tony's exit.

          behind her is Kenny Morton, her producer and behind
          them are three men carrying portable TV equipment,

          I always liked that town. That' S

                       December 8, 2002



The Woodward Forensic Institute (WFI) is a 175-bed Intermediate
Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric
patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories
of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the
Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State
or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian.

OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS:


INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN




PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM
CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second
before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a
glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it.
Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs
(wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30,
sharp and prettier than she knows.




INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING

Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on,
goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the
water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something
slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A
person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the
perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like
graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She
emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself
in a towel.




INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING

Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.




INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial
analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast.
Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case
file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the
newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.




EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps.
Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers.
Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives
off.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR

Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets
her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the
wall:

                                           (CONTINUED)

The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as
we...







INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING

Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the
according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces
a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic,
deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session:

                           MIRANDA

             This is your stepfather who came
             to visit you?

                           CHLOE

             My stepfather?  No.   He's dead.
                     (beat)
             I killed him.
Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough.
Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist.

                           MIRANDA

             That's the first time you admit
             it.

                          CHLOE

             So? There's a first time for
             everything.

                           MIRANDA

                     (jotting this down)
             It means you're finally past the
             denial stage. This is good,
             Chloe.

                           CHLOE

             I never killed anyone who didn't
             deserve it.

                            MIRANDA

             You only killed your stepfather as
             far as I know.

                           CHLOE

             I should've taken care of my
             mother. She knew all along.    You
             remind me of her.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        3.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             I remind you of your mother?

                           CHLOE

             Always so put together. Like you
             iron your underwear. Like your
             pussy is the apricot of the
             Promised Land and the bread of
             the --

                           MIRANDA

                     (getting her back
                     on track)
             Let's get back to your visitor
             last night.

                           CHLOE

             The Devil.

                           MIRANDA

             Alright, the Devil. Why would the
             Devil visit you? It's already
             hell in here, what would he have
             to gain?

                           CHLOE

             He came to fuck an angel.
                     (giggles at that)
             I'm his dirty angel.
Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER
AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up.

                           CHLOE

             He grabbed me by the hair while I
             sucked him and usually I love
             that, I just do -- maybe you can
             tell me why I love it so much --
             but not this time, he was just too
             rough --
As suddenly as it went out, now the POWER RETURNS.      A
visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock.

                           MIRANDA

             That's it until Monday. Try and
             get some sleep tonight, okay?

                           CHLOE

             Sure, Doctor.
                     (leans in)
             Crazy people hear messages from
             God. Not the Devil. You know
             that, right?

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                       4.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             I didn't say you were crazy.

                           CHLOE

             You don't have to say it.
She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this.
Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods
for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away
from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the
asylum.




INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

Miranda locks her office, armed with paperwork. The end
of another workweek. DR. PETE GRAHAM, a good ten years
older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches.

                           PETE

             Dr. Grey.

                           MIRANDA

             Dr. Graham.
They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues
who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other.      A
lot.

                           PETE

             Power went out again in our wing.

                           MIRANDA

                     (knows what's coming)
             Same here.

                           PETE

             It's not shrink-appropriate to be
             afraid of the dark, you know?

                           MIRANDA

             You're not shrink appropriate and
             you're about to get promoted.
             Everybody's afraid of something.

                           PETE

             What am I afraid of?

                           MIRANDA

             Yourself. At least you should be.
             What are you up to this weekend?

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         5.

                           PETE

             Write a little country music,
             decline invites to grand social
             events, drink myself to sleep --
             the usual. You?

                           MIRANDA

             Doug wants to look at some Real
             Estate up at Willow's Creek.

                           PETE

             Again?

                           MIRANDA

             He thinks it's fun.

                           PETE

             So is golfing, I'm told.   Who was
             your six o'clock?

                           MIRANDA

             Chloe McGrath -- talk about trying
             to empty the ocean with a tea cup.
             She's a mess.

                           PETE

             I hear Manhattan's full of them.

                           MIRANDA

             Don't start with that. I already
             turned down the job. We're
             staying.

                           PETE

             Good girl.
They have reached an office marked "DR. PHILLIP PARSONS
DIRECTOR" and peer in to see Parsons (50's,
distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the
phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to
exit when he covers the mouthpiece --

                           PARSONS

             Miranda, my wife keeps wanting to
             set that dinner with you and Doug.
             Are you free tonight?

                           MIRANDA

             He's stuck at a school board
             meeting.
Parsons looks through his appointment book.

             You've been here a year already,
             Dorothy's starting to take this
             personal. How's next Wednesday?




                           MIRANDA

             Next Wednesday it is, Phil.
He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone
call.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind.
A GUARD waves her off.




END OPENING CREDITS.





EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up
ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road.
EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her
down.




INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

SHERIFF RYAN, 40'S, recognizes her and ambles over.

                           MIRANDA

             Anybody hurt, Sheriff?

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Nah, telephone post just decided
             to fall. It'll take us a while to
             clear this up so I'm afraid you're
             gonna have to take the long way
             home, Miranda.

                           MIRANDA

             If you say so.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             And tell your husband he owes me a
             phone call.

                           MIRANDA

             Will do. Wouldn't want him in
             trouble with the authorities.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                           7.





CONTINUED:





                           SHERIFF RYAN

             That a girl. The law never sleeps
             and all that. You take care now.



He taps on her hood and heads back to the site.      She
shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn.




EXT. OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge.
Something definitely creepy about this deserted place --







INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING

Miranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the
machine.

                           MIRANDA

                     (into phone)
             Hi, it's me. Are you there? Pick
             up, pick up. I'm on my way but I
             just got detoured so I'm...
A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the
passenger seat. She reaches for it and when she looks up
we see:




POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

A TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us.      Naked.
About to get pummelled by us.




BACK TO SCENE

Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing.
METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the
car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT --
She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing
back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out
of it.

                           MIRANDA

                     (into phone)
             Stay on the line. Don't go
             anywhere. The weirdest thing
             just --
                     (the phone cuts out)
             Hello? Hello?

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                          8.





CONTINUED:




She stares at the dead phone.      Punches the buttons on it.
No go.

                           MIRANDA

             Wonderful.
She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car.




EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not
moving. Just standing there. Her back to us.

                            MIRANDA

             Hello?   Are you hurt?   Hello?
Nothing.     As we get closer we see she is covered in
bruises.     Clearly something horrible has happened to her.

                            MIRANDA

             Were you in an accident? Were you
             attacked? It's okay, I'm a doctor.
                     (beat)
             My name is Miranda Grey...
And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip,
black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around
the girl --

                           MIRANDA

             You're in shock right now, that's
             perfectly natural. I'm going to
             get you to the hospital. Okay?
The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm.         Hard.

                           MIRANDA

             Don't be scared. It's going to be
             fine.
Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements
desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning
person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.

                           MIRANDA

             Hands off me, okay? Tell me your
             name, do you remember your name?
The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead
she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell.
And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much
stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                              9.

                           MIRANDA

             What are you doing? I'm trying to
             help you --?!



The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as
Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the
girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.

                                            SLAM CUT TO:





INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat.         Just a bad dream.    A
beat.
FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE
SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely
familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP.
Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of
water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there.
She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And
now she glances around the room and realizes this is not
her bedroom.
She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over
something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat
goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a
small opening in the door. A glass pane.
She peers through the glass at the empty corridor
outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's
inside a cell.
She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic --

                            MIRANDA

             Hello?   Somebody help me!







EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

CAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard.
Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP
sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens.
The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab
prison, with separate wings (male and female), research
units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.




                                                    10.





INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS




A bored group of female patients listen to a social
worker lecturing them. A janitor mops a long corridor.
Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of
orderlies.



A doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an
epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as SHELLEY). They
force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing
her tongue, prepare a syringe.

doctors, discussing a patient's progress on a chart.
Now we are MOVING up the main building's wall and THROUGH
large windows into --




INT. FEMALE WING STAIRS

Pete rushes up two steps at a time, passing by a NURSE
WITH A CART OF MEDS, who nods respectfully as he goes --







INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S CELL

An ORDERLY unlocks the door for Pete. Through the glass
pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the
head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's: IRENE.

                        ORDERLY #1

          Sleeping beauty is awake.
Peter forces a smile, enters --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL


                        MIRANDA

          Peter, what the hell is going on?
Pete nods at Irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here.

                        PETE

          How do you feel?

                        MIRANDA

          How do you think I feel?    Is this
          a joke?
Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the
nurse with the meds to come in. Miranda catches all of
this, growing more agitated. She wears the uniform all
patients wear: a white T-shirt and sweats. Her wedding
ring is gone.

             What are you doing?

                           PETE

             Giving you something to calm down.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't need to calm down.   What I
             need is an explanation
Pete grabs the meds from the nurse. Irene and the
attendant step closer to help. Miranda feels them
closing in on her. Peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle:

                           PETE

             Just take this and we can sit down
             and chat.

                           MIRANDA

             Why here, why not in my office?
She looks at the silent faces around her. No sympathy.
Or maybe too much sympathy. Either way it's unnerving.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't want an anticonvulsant, at
             least give me Valium.

                           PETE

                     (nods at nurse)
             Fifty milligrams.

                           MIRANDA

             Jesus Christ, you're gonna knock
             me out? Ten milligrams.

                             PETE

                       (final offer)
             Twenty.
The nurse complies. Miranda stares at the meds, trying
desperately to put this into some kind of perspective.

                           MIRANDA

             How would you feel if you woke up
             in a goddamn cell, dressed like this?

                           PETE

             We can discuss it at length after
             you take your meds.
Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant.
Pete holds Miranda's gaze. Miranda takes her meds.

                             MIRANDA

             Okay.    This better be good.
Pete motions for the others to leave them alone.         One by
one they file out and lock the door behind them.




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - LATER

Miranda paces.       Alone with Pete, she is even more upset.

                           PETE

             Miranda, this is very awkward.
             Technically I shouldn't even be
             treating you but the court has
             granted us a waiver until you're
             transferred. So whatever is said
             here won't leave this room. I
             won't tell Parsons, I won't tell
             anyone.

                           MIRANDA

             I want to talk to my husband.

                           PETE

             You can't to that. Sit down,
             please. Try to relax.

                           MIRANDA

             Why would I pretend to be in any
             way relaxed?

                           PETE

             I understand you're upset. But we
             need to put some things in order.

                           MIRANDA

             Two massive understatements.
He hesitates, unsure where to begin.

                           PETE

             How long have you been here?

                           MIRANDA

                     (laughs)
             What is this? Why are you doing
             this to me?

                           PETE

             Just answer the question.    Humor
             me.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                           MIRANDA

             Hi, my name is Miranda Grey. I'm a
             psychiatrist. I transferred here to
             the Woodward Forensic Institute a
             little over a year ago. My job
             entails dealing with a ward of
             schizophrenic women between the
             ages of eighteen and fifty-fife --

                           PETE

             I don't mean how long you've
             worked here, I mean how long
             you've been staying here.
This stops her. Wanting desperately to whip out a
comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm a doctor, yes? Or was medical
             school just an elaborate dream?

                           PETE

             Of course you're a doctor. A
             great doctor in fact.
The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her.

                           MIRANDA

             Pete, how long have I been here?

                          PETE

             Five days.

                           MIRANDA

                     (barely audible)
             What?

                           PETE

             You were admitted to the
             neurosurgical unit seizing
             violently. That lasted three
             days. Scans revealed left-sided
             weakness, numbness and severe
             fontal lobe deficits.
Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we --




FLASHBACK - INT. NEUROSURGICAL UNIT

Miranda seizing violently FROM HER POV: Doctors
struggling to contain her. Arms thrashing, legs.
FLASHES of the wall, the floor. Head crashing against a
cart, out of control.

             You came out of it and tested
             negative for PCP, underwent
             extensive hypnosis and received
             amytal injections.
FLASH: Miranda being tied down.      A nurse with a
syringe --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

She looks down at her wrists with the reddish marks.

                            PETE

             You were tied down for a day and a
             half so you wouldn't hurt yourself
             and then you went into a state of,
             well --
                     (how to put this?)
             You've been pretty much catatonic.
                     (beat)
             This is the first time you speak.
Miranda, speechless.     Reality sinking in.

                            MIRANDA

             Doug must be worried sick.   I need
             to call him --
Pete shakes his head emphatically.

                           PETE

             You're the most logical person I
             know, bar none. Plus you have a
             photographic memory -- unconfirmed,
             but you do remember events and
             phrases more accurately than anyone
             around. Why am I telling you this?

                           MIRANDA

             You're establishing my personality
             as fairly intellectual, you don't
             consider me impulsive or emotional.

                           PETE

             And that's a fair assessment, no?

                           MIRANDA

             Yes, that's fair. And following
             this pattern of analysis, we're
             about to discuss a traumatic event
             that rendered this psychological
             profile useless, correct?

             Two hundred percent.
A pause here. He's waiting for her to continue. She's
not used to being on the other side of the therapist's
table.

                           MIRANDA

             You think I'm in denial. That I'm
             putting on a brave show -- that
             this is a 'cover' for some
             unbearable emotion I'm hiding.
             Why?

                           PETE

             Don't analyze yourself, just focus
             on remembering.

                           MIRANDA

             I remember Friday night after
             work, if you say that was five
             days ago --
                     (pushing on)
             Anyway, I asked you what you were
             doing for the weekend and you said
             the usual and you made a joke
             about writing country songs and
             drinking yourself to sleep and I
             told you I was going to look at
             some real estate in Willows Creek
             with Doug.

                           PETE

             And then what?

                           MIRANDA

             Then I drove home.

                           PETE

             And then what?

                           MIRANDA

             I got home, I guess, and had
             dinner by myself because --
                     (pauses, struggling)
             Because Doug had an alumni meeting
             at his school and he was going to
             get a ride back. He's the
             principal now, as you well know.
She stops here. Pete waits. The silence is deafening.
She pushes on, but her hands shake a little.

                           MIRANDA

             But wait -- there was an accident
             before that, wasn't there? A girl
             -- she had been beaten. I took
             her to the hospital, right?

                           PETE

             There was indeed an accident, you
             were detoured by the cops. But
             there's no report of any girl.

                           MIRANDA

             No, the cops weren't there. They
             were back on Main Road. A
             knocked-down telephone post,
             correct?
Pete nods.     Miranda is all foggy on the details:

                           MIRANDA

             I saw the girl after that.   She
             was bleeding.

          What's the last memory you have of

          My last -- ?
                  (frowns)
          Tell me nothing happened to Doug.

                        PETE

          Let's backtrack a second. You left
          your office, you were driving home,
          you got detoured by the police --
          Did you call someone on the phone
          that night?

                          MIRANDA

          I don't know.    I might have.

                        PETE

          Who would you call?

                        MIRANDA

          I might have called Doug to tell
          him something. Or checked my
          answering service.

                        PETE

          Were you seeing someone else that
          night?

                        MIRANDA

          I beg your pardon?

                        PETE

          There was some trouble in your

             No. There was no trouble in my
             marriage, I don't know what --
                     (stops herself)
             There is no trouble in my
             marriage. You just used the past
             tense; why?
His face says he doesn't know how to tell her.

             Did something happen to Doug?

                           PETE

             You don't remember anything else.
             Anything at all?
Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to
dial:

                           MIRANDA

             This is preposterous.    What's

             He's dead.
This stops her cold. Time stands eerily still. She
stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he
will contradict his statement.

                           MIRANDA

             No, he's not. Don't tell me that.
             Don't tell me that.

             I'm positive.

             You killed him.

           You just need to sleep. It's

Off Pete's nod, a nurse injects the syringe into
Miranda's arm. They hold her down with great effort as

He smiles weakly at the compliment. Moves his hand
towards her, in an affectionate gesture (or so Miranda
thinks) but instead fixes her bra strap. Ever
methodical.




EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

Miranda and a man exit the theater.    Giggling.

                                       FLASH CUT TO:





                                                     20.





INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

INT. LOFT - NIGHT

A flustered Miranda fumbles with her purse and keys,
heads for the door. She tries to fix her smeared
lipstick and messed-up hair. TURNS TO CAMERA:

                        MIRANDA

          I'm sorry. The fact is I'm
          married and I -- this is not me,
          this is a mistake.
First we hear our mystery man's voice, then we see him:
Pete. (Yes, the same person she kissed and went to the
movies with.) He places his hand on the door, blocking
her.

                        PETE

          Your marriage is the mistake and
          you know it.

                          MIRANDA

          Don't.

                        PETE

          I'm sorry. That was out of line.
          I feel like a school kid hiding
          from the Principal.

                        MIRANDA

          We are hiding from the Principal.
He smiles. Touches her face tenderly. Torn. A person
used to doing the right thing but not liking that at the
moment.

                         PETE

          I would just like to spend some
          time together.

                        MIRANDA

          We spend time together every day.

                        PETE

          I meant minus the schizophrenic
          women.

                          MIRANDA

          I have to go.    I need time to think.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                         21.





CONTINUED:




He nods.     Opens the door for her.     She starts to walk
away.

                           PETE

             Don't be too hard on yourself, Dr.
             Grey. You haven't done anything
             wrong.

                            MIRANDA

             Not yet.   But I want to.




EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - MORNING

PUSH INTO a quiet house on a quiet suburban street. Two
Volvos parked in the driveway. Perfectly-kept front lawn.

                                               CUT TO:








FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

Another near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the
floor covered with bloodstains. Bloodstained axe on
floor in f.g. Walls covered with bloodstains.




EXT. CHAPEL - DAY

Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly
hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a
handkerchief.




INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick
streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand,
noticing the blood -- and now we are back in --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Miranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the
room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes
her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across
the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched.
We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like
somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see
anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks
through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She
glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and
bangs on the door.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        22.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             Can I get some assistance here?
             Hello?!



She waits.     Bangs on the door again.

                            MIRANDA

             Irene?!   Anybody!?
A beat. And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.
A light is switched on down the corridor.
The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER... and CLOSER...
Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her
forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right
out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES
it.
Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens.
Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and
peeks --
The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a
pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda
jumps back, screams.
And when she looks up again, the image is gone.      A beat.
Rational thought kicking in --

                            MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             Wake up, wake up...
                     (beat)
             You're dreaming. It's not real.
             An anxiety dream, that's all.
             That's all. This is dream logic.
             If it was real, they would have
             heard you scream. There are
             twenty employees on the night
             shift. Fact. At least twenty.
She props herself with her back against the wall. With a
view of the whole cell. Just in case. Staring at the
door.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm just dreaming.
And now, FAINTLY at first, but GROWING LOUDER --
FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside. Just like
before.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         23.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm
             dreaming, I'm dreaming.



Like her life depends on that mantra. The FOOTSTEPS get
CLOSER. And her voice begins to falter --

                           MIRANDA

                     (voice rising)
             I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming --
And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before
and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are
hit with the sudden glare of returning light.
EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS --

                           IRENE (O.S.)

             Rise and shine, ladies!




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

Irene tries to shake Miranda awake.       An orderly and nurse
stand by.

                           IRENE

                     (shaking her)
             That means you, honey.   Up -- !
No reaction.

                           IRENE

             Rise and shine now.    Wake up.
She shakes her harder. And now Miranda's EYES SHOOT OPEN
and she grips Irene's arm. Hard. Like the teenage girl
did.

                           IRENE

             Easy now, it's okay.
Miranda stares at her, coming back to. Starts to speak
but has no voice. Clears her throat --

                           MIRANDA

             I need to see Peter Graham.

                           IRENE

             And you have a session scheduled
             this afternoon --

                           MIRANDA

             Right now.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        24.





CONTINUED:





                            IRENE

             He's not even in yet, now let go
             my arm, honey.




                           MIRANDA

             Doctor Grey, if you don't mind.

                           IRENE

             Actually I do mind. I start
             calling you 'doctor' and everybody
             else wants to be called 'doctor' --

                           MIRANDA

             Please. It's a bit different,
             wouldn't you say -- ?
Irene reaches out her hand and the nurse places a cup
with meds on it.

                           MIRANDA

             What do you think you're doing?    I
             want to speak to my lawyer --
             wait, what are you doing?

                           IRENE

             My job.
Irene shoves the meds into Miranda's mouth --

                           MIRANDA

             C'mon, Irene, don't do this. I'm
             calm now, look -- I'm calm -- !
She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates
her.




INT. REC ROOM - DAY

DRIFTING PAST the female patients at their usual activities.
Some watch TV, play dominoes, some pretend to read, some
stare out blankly. Here's Chloe at a table, engaged in
some sort of trivia game with a tattooed Southern redhead
named JENNA:

                           CHLOE


             M.


                           JENNA

             Mallorol, Matzine, Megaphen,
             Meallaril-S, Meleretten, Meleril,
             Mellaril, Mellaril-S, Mesoridazine,
             Methotrimaprazine, Mixidol, Moban
             Modalina --

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         25.





CONTINUED:





                            CHLOE

             Modalina?   Isn't that a band?

                           JENNA

             Trade name for Triflupoerazine.
             Look it up.
Chloe shrugs, if you say so.       Jenna resumes:

                           JENNA

             Moditen, Molindone, Moltipress,
             Motival. That's it for the 'M's.

                           CHLOE

             Not bad. High potency
             neuroleptics starting with 'J.'

                           JENNA

             Trick question. There's only
             Jatroneural.

                           CHLOE

             What do you wanna bet?

                           JENNA

             Bet you a soda.
Chloe checks a reference book.       Nods, impressed.

                           CHLOE

             Right on the money, cowgirl.
             Twenty points and a soda.
CAMERA FOLLOWS HER INTENT GAZE to another patient,
SHELLEY (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit)
moseying across the room. Nervously takes a seat beside
Miranda.

                           SHELLEY

             Hi there, Doc.
It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to
react. She looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out
of it.

                           SHELLEY

             I never got shrinked by you but
             all I hear is nothing gets past
             you, I mean, that's just hearsay
             and I don't pay much attention to
             hearsay because now they say you
             hacked your husband with an axe
             but I say maybe it just slipped,
             right?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        26.





CONTINUED:




Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled
NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. Shelley catches this look and slides
it over to her. Without malice, like a child.




                           SHELLEY

             They put your picture in the
             paper.
It reads "SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SLAUGHTERED. WIFE UNDER
ARREST." Photos of Miranda, Douglas, their house.
Miranda stares at it in disbelief.      Growing sick.

                           MIRANDA

             How did you get this?

                           SHELLEY

             Chloe did. Who knows how? Not
             me. Around here I'm on a need to
             know basis about stuff and most
             stuff I don't need to know. My
             point is about people talking
             behind other people's backs. Like
             before I was here, everything I
             did I thought, 'this'll get them,'
             wanting their approval, wanting
             them to say good things behind my
             back. But now I'm more anonymous,
             more myself. I'm Shelley.
Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley, clueless as
to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has
no problem holding a conversation all by herself --

                           SHELLEY

             You're not like, undercover here,
             are you? They pulled that at
             Spring Grove, had a bunch of
             doctors pretend they were
             patients, see if they could handle
             it. Most quit after day one.
             You're not, are you?

                            MIRANDA

             No, Shelley.   I'm not undercover.

                           SHELLEY

             Because if you were, I'm like the
             Fort Knox of secrets. Ask
             anybody.

                           MIRANDA

             That's good to know. But I'm not.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         27.





CONTINUED:





                           SHELLEY

             Say no more.
                     (sotto)
             I understand perfectly.



She hands Miranda paper and some crayons, whispers:

                           SHELLEY

             Drawing is a great cover.   Good
             luck to you.
With a wink, she's gone. Miranda looks at the room
around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and
the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about,
arguing --
Life among the insane.




INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA - DAY

Patients undress in the bare-bones locker area. An
uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by
Irene.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't -- I think I'm alright.

                            IRENE

             You go in last because you're
             special.
                      (off Miranda's look)
             It's not a Mexican prison, toots.
             Everybody here minds their own
             business.

                           MIRANDA

             If it's all the same, I'd
             rather --

                            IRENE

             State law says we keep you ladies
             clean. And I'm a stickler for the
             law.
                     (beat)
             Now come on. If you go downtown,
             you gotta dance.
Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of
the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like
about institutional bathing.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                    28.





CONTINUED:




The shower, like everything else in this place, is
regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of
patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze
on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes
for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last
refrain from the Stones' "START ME UP."

                           IRENE

                     (checking watch)
             That's five minutes, group one.
                     (to Chloe's group)
             Alright, ladies, nice and easy.
The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past
Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their
many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls:
names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars,
cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda,
slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in
the corner.
A moment later Irene nods for her to go in.




INT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER

Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her
eyes, trying to shut it all out.
The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda
and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last
two out from the previous group, grab towels.
Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but
Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her
at the tile wall.
More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted
water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a
handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted
pipe.
PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of
blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems
to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system.
The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the
laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the
tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more
blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall.
Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is
the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her
eyes.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         29.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             It isn't real. It isn't real.



Opens her eyes.
Five letters are written in blood.       N-O-T-A-L.
Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the
drain, too scared to look back up.

                            MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             It isn't real. You're
             hallucinating.
Perhaps. But now blood drips by       her ankle, DRIP, DRIP,
DRIP. And the shooting pain she       feels is coming from her
arm. What the hell -- ? WE SEE        SHARP SLASHES appearing
on her skin, like some invisible      knife is slicing her.
Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers --




INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA

Miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked
out to process anything. Fumbles for her clothes and heads
straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering.

                           MIRANDA

             Shelley?

                           SHELLEY

             And pick up those damn cigarette
             butts. Jesus, TV is dumb --

                           MIRANDA

             Shelley, can you do me a favor??
Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look.

                           SHELLEY

             The housewives will find something
             better to do.

                           MIRANDA

             Can you go in the shower and tell
             me if you see anything on the wall?
Shelley doesn't respond. Simply crosses over and heads
for the showers. Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her
shoulder makes her jump --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         30.

                           IRENE

             Enough privacy for you?

                            MIRANDA

             Yes.   Thank you, Irene.
But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the
towel.

                           IRENE

             What did you do?

                            MIRANDA

             Nothing.   It's nothing --

                           IRENE

             What the hell did you do to
             yourself?!
And now the other patients are curiously watching as
orderlies RUSH IN to haul her away.




INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

THROUGH a glass pane we see a NURSE bandaging Miranda's
arm. Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room.

                           IRENE

             I looked away for a second. It's
             unacceptable, won't happen again.

                           PARSONS

             Not your fault. Patients always
             find a way to hurt themselves if
             that's what they want.

                           IRENE

             I just didn't peg her for a
             cutter, that's all.
Parsons watches Miranda through the glass.       She can't
look him in the eye.







INT. REC ROOM - LATER

Miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks
from the other patients as she rejoins them. Spots
Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens. Scared.

                            SHELLEY

             Oh my God.   Oh my God.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          31.

                           MIRANDA

             You saw it?

                            SHELLEY

             Listen, Doctor. Some people, they
             have a gift. And in here, because
             they categorize us as a bunch of
             schizos, they refuse to
             acknowledge that. It's like that
             Hubble telescope that sees things
             a trillion miles away but what
             it's seeing is just reflected
             light of a star that died a
             thousand years ago? It's like
             that. Doesn't mean you're crazy.
             It only means your eyes open in a
             different way.
Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but
has a sinking feeling.

                           MIRANDA

             What did it say?

                           SHELLEY

             On the telescope?

                           MIRANDA

             Did you see anything, Shelley?
Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear.

                           SHELLEY

             That's not tile that wall is made
             out of . It's a holographic
             screen. All part of your mission,
             isn't it?
Miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish.     Walks away.

                           MIRANDA

             Thanks anyway.

                           SHELLEY

                     (taps her forehead)
             This is all we have. The rest is
             dust.




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

Pete and Miranda stare at each other.     A tense beat.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                           MIRANDA

             It was you I called that night.

                            PETE

             Yes.

                           MIRANDA

             Did you mention that to the cops?

                            PETE

             No.

                            MIRANDA

             Why?

                           PETE

             I didn't think it would help you.

                           MIRANDA

             What does that mean?

                           PETE

             It means they wouldn't have let me
             treat you if they thought I had
             any kind of involvement in what
             happened.

                            MIRANDA

             And did you?

                            PETE

             Did I what?

                           MIRANDA

             Did I make it to your place?   Did
             I see you that night?

                           PETE

             No. We got disconnected and I
             couldn't get through to you. I
             sat there waiting all night.
             Figured you'd changed your mind.

                           MIRANDA

             Why didn't you tell me this before?

                           PETE

             Because the only way you'll be
             able to accept these events is if
             you remember them on your own. My
             job is to assist you in processing
             that information because you're
             not in a frame of mind to do it by
             yourself.

She stares at him.     Queasy.

                           MIRANDA

             You're changing the subject.




                           PETE

             The subject is you don't trust me.

                           MIRANDA

             Right now I don't trust anyone.
She tries to read his face. Reminds herself of who Pete
is and what he means to her. He points at her bandaged
arm.

                           PETE

             You want to talk about today?
She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head.
Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare:

                           MIRANDA

             I want to talk to my lawyer.

                           PETE

             I think that's premature.

                           MIRANDA

             I can't help what you think.

                                             FADE OUT.





FADE IN:





EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY

SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP,
THWIP... The female patients are out in the gardens for
their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at
a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered
to her:

                           JENNA

             You a Marlboro girl?
Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't smoke, thanks.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                          34.

                            JENNA

             All we have is our health,
             cupcake.
                      (sits beside her)
             What I do is quit constantly,
             start again. Drives them all
             crazy. One day I quit three
             times.

                          MIRANDA

             Huh.
Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly.
Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna
rambles on.

                           JENNA

             They allow me one match at a time
             and pretend they're not watching.
             Check it out: salivating goon
             number one at three o'clock, oh-
             so-inconspicuous goon number two
             at five o'clock.
Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being
closely watched by two orderlies.

                           MIRANDA

             What did you set on fire to wind
             up here?

                           JENNA

             Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt
             down the building where I worked.
             I found a baby at the doorstep,
             called the cops -- of course the
             bottom feeding pricks never
             showed. It's beside the point,
             really.
Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about
but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the
building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She
rises --

                          MIRANDA

             Phil.
He keeps walking.     Headed to the parking lot beyond.

                          MIRANDA

             Phil!

He turns. His first instinct is to smile. But he checks
himself, reminding himself of her new status. Slips into
his best professional face:




                           PARSONS

             Hello, Miranda.

                           MIRANDA

             I wonder if I could talk to you.

                           PARSONS

             Of course.
                     (checks his watch)
             Well, actually, I'm about to...

                           MIRANDA

             Your staff meeting's done and
             Thursdays you don't schedule
             sessions until the afternoon.
             This will just take one minute.
             Promise.
Impressive.    She remembers his schedule perfectly.

                          PARSONS

             True.
                     (points)
             But the Sheriff wants to ask me
             some questions.
She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff
Ryan emerges from his patrol car. Miranda nods.

                           MIRANDA

             It's about Pete.

                           PARSONS

             What about him?

                           MIRANDA

             Perhaps he's not the most
             qualified person to be treating
             me.
His tone is fatherly yet direct.

                           PARSONS

             Are you complaining about his
             methods or are you referring to
             the nature of your past
             relationship with him?
This surprises her.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         36.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             What did he tell you?

                           PARSONS

             He explained there might be a
             conflict of interest because he
             has feelings for you. You two
             engaged in a kiss at one point.
             Am I right?

                             MIRANDA

             Yes.

                           PARSONS

             I told him we're all grownups here
             and the fact is he's the best doctor
             on my staff. As such, and given the
             severity of the charges you face, I
             consider him the most qualified person
             to assist your recovery. Now, if
             you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is
             not a patient man.
Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling
like an idiot. Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his
car. The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs
past her, yelling --

                             IRENE

             Hey!   Chloe!
Now two ORDERLIES race past. Miranda looks over to see
what the fuss is all about. Chloe is on top of an
institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round
black woman named CONSUELO. Punching her --
Other patients have crowded around the scuffle.

                           CHLOE

             You fucking cow giving me the evil
             eye, huh? Fuck you, you fuckin'
             voodoo witch -- !
Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo. Chloe kicks
and screams like an animal. Consuelo meekly stands up.

                           CONSUELO

                     (heavy Cuban accent)
             Is okay, she's okay -- she don't
             mean nothing.

                           CHLOE

             You bet your goddamn fat ass I
             mean it, you're a witch -- !!

                           IRENE

             McGrath, that's enough!
The orderlies start pulling Chloe away.      Chloe spits at
Consuelo, full of venom.

                           CHLOE

             Take your voodoo shit back to
             Cuba --

                           IRENE

             I said that's enough.

                           CONSUELO

             Irene, she's okay. Pobrecita, la
             infeliz. It's a misunderstanding.
             Pobrecita. I was only trying to
             help her --

                            CHLOE

             You wanna help me? You pity me?
                      (grabbing her
                       crotch)
             Suck me.
The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd.
Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her
manner says she just wants to get back to her duties.
Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they
were doing.
Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something
catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office
window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd.

A sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH --







INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR

SLOW PUSH DOWN empty corridors.      The air thick with dread --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT

Miranda cries softly, unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in
from the corridor outside, wardens on their rounds, a
SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts
her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach.

Irene escorts Miranda into the library.       A warden
follows.

                           IRENE

             How are we feeling today?

                           MIRANDA

             'We'?

                           IRENE

             Sorry I asked.

                           MIRANDA

             Doesn't seem like the best choice
             of words when treating
             schizophrenics.

                           IRENE

             Fitting right in, aren't you?
The library is pretty    much empty at this hour except for
the LIBRARIAN and the    odd janitor tidying up. An
efficient-looking man    rises from a desk, briefcase in
place, glass of water    -- this is attorney THEODORE

"TEDDY" HOWARD.


                           TEDDY HOWARD

             Miranda.

                           MIRANDA

             Hi.
Irene checks her watch.       The warden hangs back, keeping
watch.

                           IRENE

             She's due back in the rec room in
             twenty, Counselor.

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             Thank you kindly.
Miranda sits.      Waits until Irene is out of hearing range.

                           MIRANDA

             Teddy, I know you knew Doug well
             and this is an extremely --




                           TEDDY HOWARD

             I'm here as your lawyer. So
             whatever my relationship was with
             Doug is no longer of consequence.
             First things first, how are they
             treating you?

                           MIRANDA

             Like I'm crazy.

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             You know this place better than
             anyone. Anything out of the
             ordinary?

                           MIRANDA

             Other than me being crazy?   No.

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             The DA is pushing for a hearing as
             soon as next week. They're eager
             to resolve this situation because
             -- well, crimes like this don't
             happen that often around here.
             Doug was a hometown boy who'd done
             good, beloved high school
             principal, a role model. Our best
             shot -- scratch that, our only
             shot -- is to claim temporary
             insanity.
As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy
bandage.

                           MIRANDA

             Wait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you
             know me. I wouldn't raise a hand
             at my husband for the life of me.
             Not even in self-defense. Isn't
             it remotely possible a burglar
             broke in or some crazed high
             school student attacked Doug and I
             went into shock?
Teddy shakes his head.

                           MIRANDA

             You're telling me there's no other
             suspects in anyone's mind?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             Frankly, no. Neighbors heard
             screams. They have you at the
             scene, they have the murder weapon
             and they have your prints everywhere.
             The only thing they don't have is
             motive.
She keeps absently playing with the bandage. The
adhesive is giving. The bandage starting to peel off.

                           MIRANDA

             Because there is no motive.

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             And that's what's confusing them.
             The fact that you're a brilliant
             psychiatrist doesn't help either.
             It fills their heads with ideas.
             They figure if you were to plan a
             murder you might know how to fake
             insanity to get out of it.
She pulls off half the bandage, back and forth. Not
looking. BUT WE SEE the beginning of a pattern in her
scarred skin --

                           MIRANDA

             I'm not faking anything.

                          TEDDY HOWARD

             Good. I pass no judgment either
             way. The point is --

                            MIRANDA

             The point is I'm the only person
             who doesn't believe I killed my
             husband. I never thought I'd say
             this, but I feel like I'm in the
             middle of a conspiracy.
                     (beat)
             Do you believe I'm crazy?
An uncomfortable Teddy takes too long before answering.
Miranda looks down, humiliated -- and now she sees it.
Perfectly carved into her arm, her scar reads:

"NOT ALONE."

Petrified, Miranda jumps back, knocks down Teddy's glass
of water all over his papers, her chair topples over.
The warden and janitor look up --
Teddy tries for delicate:

             Forget it.   Forget I asked.
PUSH INTO her face as involuntary tears roll down and we --




INT. PETE'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda. Numb. Pete trying hard to get through. A
beat. We get a good look at the writing on her arm.
(The right arm.)

                           PETE

             I can't help you if you don't talk
             to me.
Silence from Miranda.     He is firm but not unkind:

                           PETE

             I can stand here all day. All
             week. You're the one running out
             of time.
Nothing.     He goes to touch her arm.   She jerks it away.

                           PETE

             What does it mean?
She shakes her head, at a loss. Torn between her
suspicion and the need to confide in someone. Finally:

                           MIRANDA

             I didn't write this.

                           PETE

             Then who?
They stare each other down. There's definitely chemistry
between these two. But the moment is far from romantic.

                           PETE

             You're going to have to trust me.

                           MIRANDA

             Why?

                           PETE

             Because no matter what's going
             through your mind right now, I
             haven't done anything wrong.

                           MIRANDA

             Then you know exactly how I feel.
He starts to speak, stops himself. Switches tactics.
Their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more
clinical:

                           PETE

             You admit you're having a hard
             time differentiating what's
             reality from what's hallucination,
             right? So isn't it at least
             possible that --

                           MIRANDA

             As a doctor I agree with you.
             Maybe -- and this is a big maybe
             -- all of this is just a deep
             epilepsy that extends to the
             limbic structures, but I'm telling
             you --

                           PETE

             How about this moment right now?

                           MIRANDA

             What about it?

                           PETE

             Is this a hallucination?

                           MIRANDA

             You tell me. But I do know what I
             sound like. Paranoia is the
             ultimate awareness, right?

                           PETE

             Which is why I suggest we simply
             increase your dose until --

                            MIRANDA

                      (venom)
             No!   Goddamnit! No!
He steps back at her blowout. She catches the look on
his face and forces herself to sit down.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm sorry. Is there any way we
             can pretend that didn't just
             happen?

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)

                     (beat; struggling)
             I want to believe you. I do. So
             I'll take your word for it --
             you're not involved in this -- but
             you take mine: I didn't write
             this and I didn't kill my husband.
He studies her.     Finally nods.   New tactic:

                           PETE

             Alright. Let's say you didn't
             write this --

                           MIRANDA

             Number one: I'm right-handed.
             Number two: I would have had to
             bring an X-Acto knife into the
             shower to do this, wouldn't I?
Pete tries to reserve judgment. Her argument has a
certain loopy logic to it. He hesitates, then pulls a
SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS from a manila envelope.

                           PETE

             I think it's time you look at
             these.
Miranda looks at the crime scene photos. Lurid.
Terrible. Here's part of Doug's body. Here's the axe.
And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words
on it. In blood, a la Manson family. And it says:

"NOT ALONE."

Miranda immediately tosses it away from her.      Repulsed --

                                         FLASH CUT TO:





FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood. Wipes
her face breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it.







INT. PETE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)


                           PETE

             You wrote that. Any idea why?

                           MIRANDA

                     (panic rising)
             No, I didn't. No, I didn't!

Pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it
up for her to study again.

                           PETE

             You're the only person who can
             figure out what this means. Try
             to remember. Stop holding back.
She nods meekly. Staring at the picture. Begins to
shake as all of it finally comes flooding in --

                                       FLASH CUT TO:





FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick
streak of blood on it. She looks down at Doug, crawling
on hands and knees. He moans horribly, in shock. She
grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He
reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and
makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying
turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles.
Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands.
Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over
her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA.
Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in
the mirror over the mantel and stares --
WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda
stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For
an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there,
beckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left
studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE
around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood
on her clothes, axe still in her hands. Looks back up
at:







THE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA

shows a serene expression on her face. Fire enveloping
her. She slowly lifts her hands over her head. In place
of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her
wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified -- like
an extreme version of Anima Sola. (A Biblical icon in
which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.)
Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment --
When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to
reality. Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it.




                                                     45.





INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - LATER




Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink. This is
a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it. She
stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at
the marks on the door handle, towels and wall.



Gasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the
shower at full blast and climbs into the tub. She
watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming
back to her body and realizing what she's done, she
slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the
tub. Crying. Shaking.     She shuts her eyes as hard as
she can to make it all go away, and we --

                                    FADE TO BLACK.





BLACKNESS

Silence. And now, faintly at first, but GROWING
PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES.




FADE IN:





INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Miranda wakes up, still in the tub. How long has she
been there, hours? Days? Impossible to know.
But at some point she must have turned off the water.
She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked
with blood.
The first thing that hits her is the stench. And it's foul,
the putrid smell of decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out
of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of
blood, mortified at what she will find.




INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family
reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness
the fruit of her labor. She gasps for air.
Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She doubles over
to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front
door.
She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on
the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still
stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff
Ryan and his deputies right behind. A concerned Pete
Graham behind them.

CONTINUED:




The cops take one look at the place and raise their guns
at her, but we can't hear what they're saying because
Miranda's ragged BREATHING has taken over the soundtrack.
Suffice to say that, at the sight of the guns, something
clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees --




INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She slips on blood, nearly falls as she scrambles to the
bedroom --







INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM

She locks the door behind her, hyperventilating in terror.
Instantly there are men POUNDING on it. SQUAWKING RADIOS.
ORDERS BARKED at her. She spots two officers through the
window in her backyard. About to smash the window.
A caged animal, completely surrounded, she covers her face
with her hands. Trembling. The doorknob jiggles violently,
about to give. And when she brings her hands down she is
staring straight into the teenage girl's face. And she
OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE and now we are back in --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Miranda gasps for air, drowning in sensory overload.

                           MIRANDA

             Oh God, oh God, oh God...
She rocks back and forth. Finally aware of what she's
done. She is the killer. No more doubts. And now that
she knows, everything is much worse.
A long, harrowing beat.
WE PUSH IN ON her devastated face.       NIGHT TURNS TO DAY.




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

The locks are unlocked. Pete appears at the door.
Miranda glances up at him. She looks like a different
person. Completely destroyed. He crouches beside her.

                          PETE

             You okay?
She shakes her head slowly. He sets his hand on her
shoulder. She turns to him and hugs him tight, holding
on for dear life. Breaks down in sobs.




                                                     47.





INT. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY




Parsons leafs through Miranda's file.   Pete stands by the
window, lost in thought.

                        PARSONS

          How much does she remember?

                        PETE

          It all came flooding back last
          night.

                        PARSONS

          Guilt?

                        PETE

          More like an uncontrollable
          reminiscence. Intense, over-
          cathected. She's not feeling
          guilty of her actions, not
          exactly. Sounds to me like last
          night she actually re-lived them
          in great detail.

                        PARSONS

          Hypermnesis following amnesia.
          Could a specific epileptic element
          be involved?

                        PETE

          That's exactly what she suggested.
          Even in her present state, her
          instincts remain impeccable.

                        PARSONS

          I'd like to talk to her.




INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

Pete escorts a fragile Miranda down the corridor.    The
two orderlies walking ominously behind them.

                        PETE

          Standard procedure.

                        MIRANDA

          I didn't say a word.







INT. DR. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY

Parsons on the phone, gestures for them to enter.

                           PARSONS

                     (into phone)
             Dorothy, I can't discuss this
             now --
                     (motions for
                      them to sit)
             I'm not taking it lightly, no.   We
             will talk about it at home.
Miranda and Pete sit across from him. Miranda trying
hard to appear composed -- acutely aware of her every
gesture, and of how different her last visit to this
office was. Nothing casual about it now.
She stares at the picture frames on Phil's desk (all
facing AWAY FROM us), the diplomas on the wall, the books
by noted fathers of neurology (works by Hughlings
Jackson, Kurt Goldstein, Henry Head, A.R. Luria). A
framed quote reads:
"'If You Do Know That Here Is One Hand, We'll Grant You
All The Rest.' -- Wittgenstein"

                           PARSONS

                     (into phone)
             Yes, dear. Me too.
He hangs up. Takes a moment to look at Miranda. Tries a
smile but to her it comes off condescending. Fact is --
there's nothing to smile about.

                           PARSONS

             I'm so sorry about this, Miranda.
She nods, dazed. Angles her head to look at a framed
picture on his desk. Parsons looks to Pete.

                           PARSONS

             Has Pete told you about the
             hearing?

                           PETE

             Teddy already filled her in.

                           PARSONS

             Teddy Howard is top notch. He's
             going to do everything in his power
             -- and he's quite resourceful -- to
             prove you're not fit to stand trial.
             Miranda, I know you have no family
             left, so we're your family now and
             we're all going down to the wire to
             protect you and help you in any way
             we --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         49.





CONTINUED:




PUSH IN ON Miranda who stares intently at something on
the desk. Not listening to a word he's saying --

                            MIRANDA

             Who is that?
Parsons pauses here.      Exchanges glances with Pete.

                            PARSONS

             Excuse me?

                           MIRANDA

             The girl in the picture.
WE SEE what she is talking about: a framed photograph on
the desk is now FACING us. Eerie. It shows Parsons, his
wife Dorothy and a young girl. Our teenage girl.

                            PARSONS

             My daughter.
Miranda looks up at this, perplexed.

                           MIRANDA

             She's the girl I saw.

                           PARSONS

             You're obviously mistaken.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm positive. She was hurt,
             bleeding. Is she all right?
Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks.

                           PETE

             Miranda, you've seen that
             photograph at least a dozen times,
             every time you've been in this
             office. You're just confused --

                           MIRANDA

             Not about this. Is she all right?

                            PARSONS

             No, she's not... all right.
                     (beat)
             Rachel committed suicide six years
             ago.
This shuts Miranda right up.      Mind spinning.

                            MIRANDA

             How?

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                      50.





CONTINUED:





                           PETE

             Miranda, that's none of your --

                            PARSONS

             That's okay.
                     (to Miranda)
             Rachel was a very troubled girl.
             Handicapped since birth. She was
             born mute. My wife and I tried
             everything to help her fit in
             but... but she ran away from home
             more than once, wanting to end her
             life.
                     (beat)
             And she finally succeeded. Jumped
             off Ashley Bridge. She was only
             seventeen years old.
Ashley Bridge. Mute. Ghost? Miranda hesitates here.
She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full
well what even her suggestion of it will sound like.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm -- I'm terribly sorry, Phil.
Parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore.    Rises.

                           PARSONS

             Peter, can I speak to you?
The men step outside. PUSH IN ON Miranda's face as she
stares at the picture of Rachel. We catch snippets of
the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her
paranoia --

                           PETE (O.S.)

             ... Textbook psychotic pattern...
             manifestation of guilt...

                           PARSONS (O.S.)

             ... much she knows about Rachel?

                           PETE (O.S.)

             I'm telling you she doesn't...
             Concocted alternate reality...

                           PARSONS (O.S.)

             I'm trusting you... crawling with
             cops.
A DARK SHADOW envelops Miranda's confused face, as we --




                                                    51.





INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT




Miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic
light. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from
the POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of
the RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes,
looks this way and that, then closes them again.
She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard
before. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP
OPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall.
Squinting to cover every inch of the room.
And now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner.
Roughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed
and slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined.
She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it.
She gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING
LOUDER as she reaches the shadow --
She stretches out her hand and finally touches...
NOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling
stupid.

                        MIRANDA

          This is not going to work. I'm
          sick of being watched, and I know
          this place well and it doesn't
          smell this bad.
She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head.

                        MIRANDA

          I'm awake, I'm not dreaming. I'm
          alive -- this is not some
          afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called
          paranormal activity can be
          debunked a million different ways.
          So whatever you are, whatever it
          is I'm making up here -- I'm
          letting you go, I'm setting you
          free. I'm the wrong person. And
          I need to sleep. I'm not afraid
          and I don't believe and I'm fully
          aware that this is all in my mind
          -- fiction -- a concocted
          alternate reality -- and I
          acknowledge it. And now I'm done
          with it. I'm going to sleep now.
The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has
psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. And
now she climbs back in bed.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                      52.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

                     (sleepy)
             Besides, if you really were the
             ghost of Rachel Parsons, you would
             let me out of this cell.
A beat. And now we hear the SOUND OF THE DEADBOLT SLIDE
OPEN. The door opens quietly. PUSH INTO Miranda's face.
Properly scared now.

                           MIRANDA

             Holy shit.
If proof is what she wanted, proof is what she got.   From
now on we'll refer to the teenage girl as RACHEL.




INT. FEMALE WARD - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling
the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall --
still making sure she isn't dreaming this.
She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of
neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily.
Nobody there. But when she looks down the other way she
sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So
quick we're not sure we saw it for sure.
Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction.
At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling
quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her
head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells.
She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when
Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing
right across from:







THE NURSES' STATION

Where two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes
past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.




ANOTHER CORRIDOR

This one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden
sound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing at
their late night show. Momentarily distracted, she
almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall.
She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a

SANITATION CLOSET.


                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                      53.





CONTINUED:




She looks for something, a tool. Discards a pair of
brushes and finds a small screwdriver. Pockets it.







THE STAIRS

Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay
clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area.
She waits at the landing, times it just right -- and
scurries to the next floor.







INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS


ACTION

Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace
as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner
and stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his
rounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to
her office.
She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the
lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as
fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes
a few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and
clumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against
the floor.
Miranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She
bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for
balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all
along. She simply forgot to check.




INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE

Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her
computer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch and a
SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view
of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a
smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on.
She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she
waits for it to boot up.




ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR

The JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards
Miranda's office corridor --

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                       54.





CONTINUED:




Miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the
computer screen reflecting against the glass pane. She
tries opening drawers but they're all locked. She
remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath
the couch, uses it to block the light.
Computer powered up, she runs an online search for
"RACHEL PARSONS." Waits as the info appears --

                           MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             Alright. What happened to you?




ON COMPUTER SCREEN

Various listings: The archive news of her funeral,
something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about
teen suicide. That's the one she chooses. Hits "PRINT."
She checks the surveillance monitor again:     the janitor
now mops right outside her door.







ON PRINTOUT

The heading says "WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?"
A quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of
three local girls who have died. Rachel's name and
PHOTOGRAPH appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and
Andrea White.
Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance
monitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him
disappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the
screen is empty.
But just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there.
Staring straight at her. Makes us jump.




INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Retracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the
stairs. Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera.




INT. FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her
way. She detours down another corridor and hides from
view. Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the
staircase.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                    55.





CONTINUED:




And now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND. Coming from inside
the room immediately behind her. Room 237. She steps to
the small glass pane on the door and peers inside.







INT. ROOM 237

It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but
now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some
sort of struggle.
Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a
flash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle.
And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim
light we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling.
Just for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the
bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS

FRAME.








INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flinches, confused. Glances down the corridor to
ensure she remains undiscovered. Then peers back in.




INT. ROOM 237

Chloe on her stomach on the bed. Her pale naked skin
marked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck
in her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open
but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or
sobbing. Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his
T-shirt.
As he discards it we see that it is yellow.




INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Disturbed, Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor
isn't empty. There is a JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup
in hand. Staring at her, disconcerted.

                          JANITOR

             Hey!
Miranda turns and runs.




INT. FEMALE WARD STAIRS

Miranda bolts down the stairs. THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS and
YELLS can be heard right behind her.




                                                      56.





INT. FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR




Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency
exit door all the way at the end.
TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase,
shouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their
cells, awakened by the COMMOTION.
Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as
she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty
feet, fifteen, ten --
When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT
appears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid
crashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers
left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and
pins her down.
The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find
her screaming, hysterical. They hold her down --

                         MIRANDA

           It's him! It's him! Jesus
           Christ, it's him!
The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea
what she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic
woman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and
we --

                                          FADE OUT.





FADE IN:





INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

TRACKING ALONG a long desk where the staff finish their
morning meeting. Parsons, Pete and Irene among others.

                         PARSONS

           We've transferred her to a higher
           security room on the fifth floor.
           That's my final concession to any
           type of special treatment.

                         PETE

           And the night staff?

                         IRENE

           They insist her room was properly
           locked, what else could they say?

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                        57.





CONTINUED:





                           PETE

             Could there be any truth to her
             claim?




                           PARSONS

             Peter, we have one hundred and
             forty employees. Thirty-five work
             maintenance. They all wear yellow
             shirts, it's their uniform. I'm
             holding a very discreet inquiry,
             sure -- but I don't want a news
             van parked outside day and night.
             It makes much more sense that she
             tried to escape and got caught,
             doesn't it?
Pete ponders this.     It certainly seems that way.

                           PETE

             I perused Miranda's files on Chloe
             McGrath -- they're damn
             comprehensive. Maybe she was a
             bit obsessed with her.
Irene and Parsons share a look.     He wraps it up:

                           PARSONS

             The scariest gift God gave us is
             our minds. And a bright person
             like Miranda -- she's grasping at
             straws here -- who knows what her
             brain is telling her, now that
             it's snapped.




INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - DAY

A better room, in fact. This one has a view. Heavy bars
on the windows, but still. Miranda paces. Pete is
seated, observing her deteriorating state.

                           MIRANDA

             Did you live here when Rachel
             killed herself?

                           PETE

             Yes. As a matter of fact, I was
             part of the search party that
             found the body.

                           MIRANDA

             Phil must have been a wreck.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         58.





CONTINUED:





                           PETE

             You can imagine. Actually, Phil
             was in Houston undergoing triple
             bypass surgery when it happened.



What was that?     Miranda reacts to this.

                           MIRANDA

             And this is confirmed. There are
             hospital records and so forth?

                           PETE

             I'm sure there are.   Can we get
             back on track now?
Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket.

                           MIRANDA

             What about these other dates, was
             Phil here when the other girls
             went missing and found dead?
A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the
pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and
Jenny Dixon.

                           PETE

             Where are you going with this?
             First I'm a suspect in Doug's
             death, now what, Phil Parsons
             murdered his own daughter?

                           MIRANDA

             Rachel Parsons disappeared six
             years ago. A week later she's a
             suicide. Andrew White, four years
             ago, same M.O., and Jenny Dixon,
             two years ago. Don't you find
             that unusual?
He regards her. Maybe Parsons is right: she's
desperately grasping at straws now. Skims the article:

                           PETE

             What same M.O.? One jumped off a
             bridge, one hung herself and one
             crashed her car. Who gave you
             this?

                            MIRANDA

             Not one left a suicide note. In
             fact, how is anybody sure these
             were suicides?

                           PETE

             You heard Phil, his daughter had
             tried several times before --




                           MIRANDA

             That's his story. I need to talk
             to the reporter who wrote that.
             Frank something.

                           PETE

             Well, you can't.

                           MIRANDA

             I beg to differ. I know my
             visitation rights.

                           PETE

             You can't because... he died.
Miranda snaps to attention here.

                           MIRANDA

             You're telling me the one local
             investigative reporter who connected
             three highly-suspicious deaths, just
             happens to have conveniently died?

                           PETE

             Frank Albright was an eighty-year-
             old retired sociology professor.
                     (re: the article)
             This is a fluff piece about
             teenage depression and the
             breakdown of the nuclear family.
             You can find one in any local
             paper, anywhere, any other week!

                           MIRANDA

             Don't be smug, Pete. That's one
             thing you've never been. Rachel
             is somehow connected to what I'm
             going through. I don't know
             how -- like you said, I'm not in a
             frame of mind to process the
             information without assistance.
             So I'm asking you for assistance.

                           PETE

             Listen to me. You are not well. I
             had hoped once you remembered the
             murder we could deal with your
             feelings about it but these
             fixations:

             Rachel Parsons, Chloe McGrath --
             are self-created distractions to
             avoid looking into yourself. And
             the longer you --

                           MIRANDA

             I know this lecture like the back
             of my hand!

                            PETE

             Good.   Saves me the trouble.
Discussion over. He raps on the door. Triple-locks come
unlocked and an ORDERLY is there. Peter exits.




INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Peter hurries down the corridor, passing by a nurse. The
same one who bandaged Miranda earlier, so let's give her
a proper name: CLAIRE. She pushes her cart into the
elevator.







INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

Claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she
heads down the long corridor, reaches a door and unlocks
it.




INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM

TIGHT ON a row of drug-filled shelves. Claire parks her
cart and kicks off her shoes. Digs a pack of smokes out
of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her.
Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner
type named SIMON. Deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands
all over her. She means to resist but he's got such
boyish charm.

                           CLAIRE

             Get off me, you dog --

                           SIMON

             Hell, don't go all bubbly with joy
             or anything.

                           CLAIRE

             You can't be in here and you know
             it. Nap in your car.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         61.





CONTINUED:




She finally twists herself out of his grasp. Points an
accusing finger, but she's grinning. Blushing, even.

                           CLAIRE

             Now get out before we get busted.
Properly reprimanded, Simon picks up his folded uniform
and prepares to leave, head hung low.

                           SIMON

             You slay me, Claire.    Honest.

                           CLAIRE

             Sure I do, Boy Scout.
He exits.    She shakes her head, slips her uniform back
on.




INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Simon presses the button, waits. He checks inside his
folded uniform where we see several stolen vials of
sedatives. The doors begin to close when --

                           CLAIRE

             Hold it, Simon!
He hides the loot behind his back, busted.       She holds the
door open and tosses him his yellow shirt.

                           CLAIRE

             What do you think I am, laundry
             service?

                           SIMON

                     (relieved)
             Won't happen again, ma'am.
She turns and exits.     The doors slide shut.   Meet our
rapist.







INT. WOODWARD CAFETERIA - DAY

Bustling with activity. The room is divided into two:          a
large main area where the patients eat, plus a second,
smaller upstairs area for the staff.
BOOM DOWN to find Miranda eating at a long table.
Shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork. Jenna
taps an unlit cigarette. As usual, Irene keeps watch
nearby.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                       62.





CONTINUED:





                           SHELLEY

             ... She'd get high on glue and
             make me help her try on my bras.
             Is that the strangest shit you've
             heard?

                           JENNA

             Heard stranger. But she's a case.

                           SHELLEY

             And she always put on a happy
             face. Man, what an optometrist.
Optometrist?     Miranda starts to correct her, but lets it
go.

                           JENNA

             You narced her out, didn't you?
             Boo-hoo. Bet you were a little
             buzzed yourself.
Miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of
conversations and comes to rest on Chloe. Alone at
another table. Heavily sedated. A wreck.
Miranda rises and walks over. Shelley waits until she's
out of hearing range, leans in to Jenna --

                           SHELLEY

             All work, that woman.   Work, work,
             work.

                           JENNA

             What are you talking about?

                           SHELLEY

             She's like an alcoholic.   But with
             work.

                          JENNA

             What work?

                           SHELLEY

             Not safe to tell you.   Wish I
             could.
Jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food.




UPSTAIRS

Parsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits beside Chloe
and starts talking. From Parson's POV up above we can
see pretty much the entire dining area.




                                                     63.





BACK TO MIRANDA




Trying to get Chloe's attention. But Chloe just stares
at her untouched food, glassy-eyed.

                         MIRANDA

           I saw what happened. I'm sorry.
No reaction.

                         MIRANDA

           Have you told anyone?   Chloe?
Nothing.

                         MIRANDA

           Look, Chloe -- the person who did
           this to you is not the devil. And
           if you can identify him, I'll make
           sure the motherfucker is arrested.
Now Chloe looks at her, like something finally registers.

                         CHLOE

           Doctor, did you just say
           'motherfucker'?

                         MIRANDA

           Do you know his name? Maybe you
           saw a nametag on his uniform?
           Think.
Chloe simply stares.    Finally shakes her head.

                         CHLOE

           Man, you must really hate me.

                          MIRANDA

           What?   I don't hate you.

                         CHLOE

           You hate me because now you're
           just the same as me. You must
           feel so embarrassed.

                         MIRANDA

           I don't hate you. And I don't
           feel embarrassed.

                         CHLOE

           That's just a pat answer you have
           because you're new at this. Trust
           me, I know what I'm talking about.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                           MIRANDA

                     (rising)
             Forget it, alright? Forget we had
             this conversation.



Chloe abruptly grabs her arm.     Tightly.

                           CHLOE

             You know what happens next?

                           MIRANDA

             I get the distinct feeling you're
             going to tell me.

                           CHLOE

             The shock wears off and the guilt
             kicks in. And that guilt is the
             real motherfucker. You'll be
             watched 24/seven, because they're
             afraid you'll kill yourself. Dr.
             Graham will question every harmless
             gesture, every innocent comment, ever
             twitch you make and eventually -- and
             it's a fucking tedious 'eventually'
             -- you'll stop hating yourself for
             what you did. But what replaces that
             hatred is this unbearable sadness. And
             you don't lose that as long as you live.
PUSH IN ON Miranda.     Deeply affected by Chloe's words, as
we --




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY AND NIGHT


MIRANDA'S RESIGNED DAILY GRIND IN QUICK DISSOLVES --

A) Miranda and the other patients line up for meds in
the rec room.
B) Irene keeps watch in the garden as the women get
their daily fresh air.
C) Wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at
night and the lights go off.







INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT

Echoing an earlier scene, we are MOVING TOWARDS her --
her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light.
Miranda flicks a look this way and that, alert. Sensing
something.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                    65.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             Leave me alone. Go away.
Just like a crazy person. She listens for any further
noise, hears none and shuts her eyes. Exhausted.

                           MIRANDA

             I've lost my fucking mind.   Happy
             now?
Silence. But now the BEDSPRINGS CREAK behind her and she
whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers
her mouth. Her eyes open wide at the sight of Simon, in
his yellow shirt. He shoves her against the mattress and
presses his full weight against her. She lets out a
muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and
brings the plunger to her throat. Straight into her
jugular.

                           SIMON

                     (sotto)
             This is gonna hurt you more than
             it hurts me.
She flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down.
The BEDSPRINGS STRAIN violently and now he's straddling
her, squeezing the plunger into her throat. Her eyes
welling up:

                           SIMON

                     (sotto)
             I've always wanted to do a doctor.
She manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from
her throat. It flies to the floor. He grins, enjoying
this:

                           SIMON

                     (sotto)
             The more you fight me, the harder
             I get, pussycat -- so pretty
             please, with sugar on top -- keep
             still.
Simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend
herself. He finally slaps her free arm down. Presses
his knee against it, immobilizing her once more. Now he
produces another syringe from his pocket. Checks it.
Miranda shakes her head, pleading. A scream stuck in her
throat. But nobody can hear her.
Simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we
hear a LOUD CLANGING at the door. Shaking it off its
hinges.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                       66.





CONTINUED:




Simon looks up, confused. Nobody is there. The split-
second distraction is all Miranda needs to shove him off
the bed. She fumbles for the discarded syringe and STABS
HIS CHEST WITH IT -- squeezes the plunger --




                           MIRANDA

                     (sotto)
             Take that, son of a bitch.
Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body
goes limp. Miranda exhales, coming back to herself. A
beat.

                           MIRANDA

             Rachel?
No response.     Miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress
him.

                                             CUT TO:





SECURITY CAMERA POV

shows a uniformed janitor calmly walking down the
corridor. PULL BACK to see we are in --







INT. SURVEILLANCE BOOTH - NIGHT

A bank of monitors keep watch on the premises   after dark.
TWO GUARDS play cards (Uno), bored to tears.    A cursory
glance at the monitors produces no reaction.    Certainly a
janitor walking down the corridor is no cause   for alarm.




EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP or whatever it is    crickets
do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing    rows of
unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon's key-ring    button
repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on   and off.




INT. SIMON'S CAR - NIGHT

Miranda slips behind the wheel, STARTS the CAR. The RADIO
KICKS IN at EAR-DEAFENING VOLUME. She nearly drops dead.




EXT. WOODWARD GATE - NIGHT

The gate GUARD reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car
approaches. The guard barely registers the driver in the
booth mirror, immersed in his article. Hits a button to
open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.




                                                   67.





INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT




Miranda, sweating, watches the receding image of the
institute behind her. Turns on the main road. Free.

                        MIRANDA

          Thank you, thank you, thank you.
She glances back, makes sure no one is following her.
Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror: the
scared eyes, the haunted face. The new version of
herself.
She flips the RADIO dial: BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. BAD
COUNTRY. BAD DISCO. More BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. She finds
IGGY POP'S entirely appropriate "THE PASSENGER) and lets
it play.




ANOTHER ANGLE

Now we are seeing her as if from the POV of someone
traveling alongside the car. Peering THROUGH the
passenger window. Miranda becomes aware of this, slowly
glances over. Sees nothing but her own reflection.
Turns back forward.
We NOTICE the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling
off the dashboard. Nothing but a long stretch of road
ahead.







EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda
parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house.
Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around
back.
She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a
deep breath and lets herself in through the back door.




INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

POLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the
kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without
even looking in the direction of the living room,
avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether.
Eerie as hell --




INT. BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS

Miranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase, finds her passport,
digs out some cash from a box. Quick change of clothes to
get rid of the rapist's uniform. Fast, fast, fast --




                                                       68.





INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT




Miranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview
mirror as she drives down the block. Shudders. Flips
the RADIO dial with shaky hands.




                          RADIO DJ (V.O.)

            ... Weather forecasters predict
            heavy winds tonight as a major
            thunderstorm rolls in tomorrow.
            You're listening to KLPG, 101.4 on
            your dial. This next honky-tonk
            heartbreak classic is...
She looks in the rearview mirror once more.      Only this
time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes.
Rachel's.     Inside the car.
Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping
abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet
sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom.
Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180
and slides to a halt in the middle of the street --
Facing the direction of her house again.




EXT. STREET

Miranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks
inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath,
making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a
U-turn.







INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling
and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked.
She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --

                          MIRANDA

            No.
The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key
but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and
notices the key is gone.

                          MIRANDA

            Why are you doing this to me?
A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more
startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the
middle of the street.




                                                      69.





EXT. STREET - NIGHT




Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty
street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys.
We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The
moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the
glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda
jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened
by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes.
She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in
her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the
pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now.
BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround
the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS
fastened around the insulators of a thick power line.
From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys.
And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming
loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some
invisible force --
Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP
and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE
WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings
straight towards the paralyzed Miranda --
She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle,
back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to
a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The
wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends
SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like
lightning.
A silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets.

                        MIRANDA

                  (fighting tears)
          What do you want from me?
No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing
over her shoulder, seemingly demented:

                        MIRANDA

          What is it you want me to do?!!
A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the
middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING
abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the
sound.
It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door
SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                       70.





CONTINUED:




Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house.

                           MIRANDA

             I can't.
                     (softly)
             Please, please don't make me go
             back in there.
But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards
it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the
road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost
electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate
yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.




INT. SIMON'S CAR

Miranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here.
She's never asked a ghost for permission before:

                           MIRANDA

             Bear with me, I'm just parking it
             out of the way so it won't look
             suspicious in the middle of the
             road -- okay.
She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk.







INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

Miranda stands in her living room, staring at her
handiwork. Frozen with dread.
The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains.
The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk
outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the
shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied
footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc.
The faded writing on the wall:       "NOT ALONE."
Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's
supposed to be looking for.

                            MIRANDA

                     (piecing it together)
             Not alone. What happened to you
             happened to other girls.
                     (beat)
             I understand. And I'm sorry. But
             there is nothing I can do about it
             now. It has nothing to do with
             me.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         71.





CONTINUED:




Not knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the
TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump.
The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL

BLAST.




She stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she
should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and
immediately doubles over in pain --

                            MIRANDA

             Shit.
She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck
right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin.
Blood already seeping from the nasty cut --




INT. BATHROOM

Miranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out
the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She
grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the
cut.
And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears
the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel.
Inside the room with her --
Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror
move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds
perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have
STOPPED. A silent beat.
She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing
as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful.
And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes
her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like
the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked
arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola.
She stares.     Mesmerized.    The sound of FLAMES GROWING

LOUDER.


                             MIRANDA

             No.   No.   No...
Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the
image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if
the two versions of her are literally walking towards
each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces
mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the
mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                     72.





CONTINUED:




Miranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt.
The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically
impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again --
the image is gone.



It is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself
staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something
just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far
corner of the room.
She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY
LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks
it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank-
repossessed property.
The address is in Willows Creek.
Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel
wanted her to see. She stares at it.
PUSH IN ON the picture as we --

                                     MATCH CUT TO:





EXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN

A "FOR SALE" sign still flapping in the wind.   The first
few rays of light break through the dawn sky.
Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it
FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out.
She studies the house before walking up the drive. We
watch her peek through windows and walk around back,
looking for something. What exactly, we don't know.
(Neither does she.)
She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes
her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't
looked.







INT. BARN

Dark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING
to FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's
just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large
room, perplexed. There is something about this place.
Something she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning
her.
With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front
door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops
her. She moves to it.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                       73.





CONTINUED:




And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow
gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A
padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both
walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy
padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall
and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only
a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness
beyond, but can't see a thing.
Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides
herself into the claustrophobic slot.
She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face
brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops,
startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light
bulb.
She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow
to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of
her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY
CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below.
Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs
down.




INT. SECRET BASEMENT

Miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness.
Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb
upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall
for a switch. Nothing.

                           MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             It's not shrink-appropriate to be
             afraid of the dark, right?
Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key-
chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast
space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient
ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's
reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it.

                          MIRANDA

             Hello?
She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on
the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half-
light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles
through it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds
a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next
to the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named

"TRACY MARIE SEAVER."


                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                    74.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             Is there anybody here?   Hello?
The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it
click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped
a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation.
Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can
make out the metallic thing that reflected light before.
It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are
several heavy chains.
Like a meat rack.
And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and
sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down,
tied around the hands and ankles.
Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the
girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter
away.

                            MIRANDA

             Go away!   Fuck off!
(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so
that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an
almost strobe-light effect:)
She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's
adrenaline at full tilt --

                           MIRANDA

             C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the
girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly,
clinically.
The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the
immediate surroundings:   household tools strewn about;
wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood.

                           MIRANDA

             Wake up, Tracy, wake up --
Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles.
The skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the
girl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too
late.




                                                          75.





EXT. BARN - LATER




Miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and
throws up. The bright light outside blinding her
momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to
register --







THE PATROL CAR

parked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER
cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up
and notices her.
Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run.      The officer waves.
His name is TURLINGTON.

                         OFFICER TURLINGTON

          Howdy there.
He says this while already strolling over.        Miranda's
mind races a mile a minute --

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          Everything okay?

                         MIRANDA

          Y-yes.

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          That your vehicle, ma'am?
She stares at the young, friendly cop. His left hand
resting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it
seems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet.

                        MIRANDA

          Yes -- I -- I just pulled over.     I
          was -- looking for a bathroom.
          Morning sickness, you know...

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          Congratulations. But I'm afraid
          this is private property -- you
          can't just waltz on in. You
          understand that.
She nods, nerves shot to hell.     Starts walking.

                        MIRANDA

          I'll be on my merry way now. My
          husband will never forgive me if I
          get a ticket for trespassing.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         76.





CONTINUED:




The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of
marital dynamics. He flashes a smile but suddenly stops,
whips out his gun and trains it on her --




                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Holy shit.
                     (clicks the safety
                      off)
             Lady, stay right where you are.
Miranda shuts her eyes, busted.     Freezes.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Hands up where I can see them.
Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Nice and slow, start talking to
             me. And make it good. Tell me
             just exactly who that is.
A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's
looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging
herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock.
Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive.
But just barely.




EXT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY

A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area.       Phil Parsons and
Pete step out, rush inside.







INT. HOSPITAL ER - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he
can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his
case --

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Mr. Howard -- let me simply list
             the events your client was
             involved in last night. First she
             drugs a janitor, steals his car
             and escapes a mental
             institution --

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             Hold on, there isn't even any
             substantial evidence --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        77.





CONTINUED:




Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink
to wash his hands --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Mr. Howard -- there isn't evidence
             because the overdosed janitor
             hasn't woken up, that's why -- and
             when your client was questioned on
             the matter she admitted to
             injecting a full syringe of --

                           TEDDY HOWARD

                     (handing him a
                      paper towel)
             You had no right to question my
             client without my presence --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom.
             Your client was read her rights and
             she still insisted --

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             -- Let me ask you this, Sheriff:
             what exactly was a janitor doing
             with several vials of sedatives
             inside my client's cell? And is
             it not possible he had taken some
             drugs himself before my client --
Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to
the waiting room, Teddy following closely --




INT. ER WAITING ROOM

Paramedics and nurses doing their thing. The young
officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of
coffee.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             I'm not a drug expert. I'm simply
             stating the frigging facts.
Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices
Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Phil, thank God -- this guy's
             driving me nuts!

                           PARSONS

             What happened?

CONTINUED:





                           SHERIFF RYAN

             An 'incident' -- for lack of a
             better frigging word -- involving
             Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's
             been tortured and is in critical
             condition and chances are slim
             she'll even utter another word.

                           PETE

             Who's the girl?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             A runaway from Portland, Tracy
             Marie Seaver. Reported missing a
             couple weeks ago. We found Miss
             Grey in some barn off Willows
             Creek with the girl all messed up.
             I'm just now waiting for the
             surgeon to give me an update.
                     (to Teddy)
             Notice, Counselor, how I'm not
             even mentioning her trespassing or
             lying to a police officer.
Teddy waves him off in frustration.     Goes to talk to
Turlington.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Christ, the woman's got the entire
             hospital busy --
Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Why are you harassing my deputies?

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             I'm only asking him where he got
             the coffee -- ?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             He's not at liberty to answer
             that. You've had enough goddamn
             coffee already.
The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to
the water cooler where they can talk more privately.

                           PETE

             We need to get Miranda back to the
             institute. She needs psychiatric
             care, not a prison cell.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          79.





CONTINUED:




Parsons nods, lost in thought.        Sheriff Ryan returns.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Phil, how well does your wife know
             the suspect?

                           PARSONS

             Why do you ask?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Because she's at the station right
             now, demanding to speak with her.
Parsons frowns at this, concerned.        Pete studies him.




INT. COUNTY STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY

Bare room. A desk and two chairs. Glass window         panes to
insure no privacy. DOROTHY PARSONS (50s) waits,        seated.
The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in.        She sits
across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be.        A long
beat.

                            DOROTHY

             How are you?
Miranda doesn't answer. Her mind elsewhere.         Namely back
at the barn and how it connects to Rachel.

                           DOROTHY

             I needed to see you, but I'm not
             sure where to begin. I don't know
             you well, I certainly have nothing
             but fond feelings for you. Phil
             always keeps me posted on his
             colleagues and his work and -- in
             any case, I have always thought of
             you as a very bright, very
             perceptive doctor. Even though I
             don't know you well.
She pauses here. Miranda looks up now. Her face hollow
and exhausted. Bags under her eyes. A person who has
seen too much. Wondering where the hell this is going.

                           DOROTHY

             My point is, my point being --
             when Rachel died I had, um, I
             suffered through these spells,
             these recurring dreams.

                           (MORE)

CONTINUED:





                           DOROTHY (CONT'D)

             And eventually, once I came to
             terms with her death, they went
             away. Losing a child is the
             hardest, most inconceivable event
             a mother can --
She drifts off.     Takes a beat to collect herself and
resume:

                           DOROTHY

             The past few days I have been
             having the same dream. A
             nightmare.
Miranda can't help but smile to herself at that.

                            MIRANDA

             That word.   Nightmare.   Welcome to
             my life.

                           DOROTHY

             This nightmare involves Rachel but
             it also involves you. In the
             nightmare Rachel holds a box in
             her left hand. A small box. And
             she repeats a series of numbers.
             Now, Rachel never spoke, from the
             time she was born -- she had a
             condition -- I often asked God why
             he punished this child in such a
             way -- she couldn't speak, but she
             was extremely bright. She wasn't
             autistic as the doctors claimed --
Dorothy Parsons starts to cry. A moment passes like
this. It seems she won't recover enough to continue her
tale.

                           MIRANDA

             Mrs. Parsons, you need a
             therapist. Normally I would
             encourage you to schedule a
             session with me but as you can
             see --
Dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish.       She pulls
out a folded piece of paper.

                           DOROTHY

             Every night the same box in her
             hand and the same numbers. I
             wrote them down.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        81.





CONTINUED:




She slides the paper over. Miranda watches her
carefully, then looks at the piece of paper. The numbers
are:




1-0-2-2-0-1.

A long beat.

                           DOROTHY

             It's a message. It's a code for
             something. I don't know what.
             But she wants you to have it.
Miranda studies it. Studies this woman, who quite
frankly seems to have completely lost her mind. Then she
looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a
realization.

                           MIRANDA

             October 22nd, 2001. It's my
             wedding date.
She stares at Dorothy, stunned. Brain click-click-
clicking. Her wildest fears confirmed: Doug is behind
this somehow.

                            MIRANDA

             That code belongs to a safety
             deposit box my husband kept in a
             bank up in Newcastle, that's where
             his parents live.
                     (beat)
             Dorothy, I need you to drive up
             there and open it.
Dorothy stares at her, scared.     And finally nods.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as
TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Miranda is brought out of
one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS.

                           PETE

             We can take those off now.
Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser.

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Don't push it, Doctor. She's
             cuffed until your people secure
             her in a cell.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                           82.





CONTINUED:




Pete sighs, gestures for the officers to bring her in.
Irene and two heavy-duty orderlies will also be part of
the escort. Miranda locks eyes with Pete as she
approaches.




                           PETE

             Are you alright?

                           MIRANDA

                     (quietly)
             I was wrong. It wasn't Phil
             Parsons. It was Doug.

                           PETE

             Can we talk about this later?
                     (to Sheriff)
             Thanks, Sheriff.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Tomorrow morning first thing my
             deputies are here.

                           PETE

             I know, I know. We'll see you
             then.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             And my offer still stands if you
             need added security.

                           PETE

             Thank you. She won't go anywhere.
             I guarantee it.
The Sheriff waves, whatever. Knocks twice on the hood
and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive.

                           MIRANDA

             That's why Rachel picked me.    It
             was Doug. I'm so stupid.
Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on
about this time. Tries to remain professional.

                             PETE

             Inside, okay?




INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

Lunch time for the female wing. An excited Shelley
rushes over to a table where Chloe and Jenna are,
whispers something to them. They glance at the door.

                                                  (CONTINUED)





                                                        83.





CONTINUED:




A moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort.
Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door.
An uneasy Pete leads. Irene and the wardens at the rear.



Miranda glances at the women staring at her like a
specimen. Like somehow she's even more dangerous than
them. Top dog, as it were, of the crazies.
And then, halfway across the room, one of the women
stands up. Chloe. She claps her hands together.
Slowly. Miranda watches her, confused. And slowly
Shelly, Jenna and others rise as well. All of them
joining Chloe in clapping.

                             PETE

             What is this?

                           IRENE

             She's a hero. Little Red Riding
             Hood put the big bad wolf in a
             coma.
Pete nods.     Just what he needed.   The OFFICERS trade looks.

                           OFFICER #1

             They're not gonna start something,
             are they?
Irene shakes her head, amused.

                           IRENE

             You ain't scared of a bunch of
             women now, are you, Officer?
The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their
solidarity for Miranda. Chloe locks eyes with her,
mouths the words "thank you."
And Miranda is hauled out the side door.




INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL

White. Surveillance cameras in every corner. Two
separate doors with elaborate locks. High security all
around. The officers undo Miranda's cuffs and excuse
themselves.
Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as
well.

                           ORDERLY #1

             We'll be right outside, Doctor.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         84.





CONTINUED:




Once the doors are locked and they're alone, the
conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear:

                           PETE

             I pulled a lot of strings to get
             you transferred back. The best
             case scenario you're looking at
             right now is five years here.
             Five. Under my --

                           MIRANDA

                     (interrupting)
             Peter, I didn't believe in ghosts
             before this. And neither do you.
Pete is at the end of his rope. Can't hide his sadness
when he looks at her. Still, he tries to get her back on
track:

                           PETE

             But you know that the brain is
             fully capable of tricking you into
             seeing all sorts of things. The
             simplest chemical deficiencies
             can --

                           MIRANDA

             Chemical deficiencies can't get
             inside of you and make you do
             terrible things you don't remember
             doing!

                            PETE

             I'm a very open-minded person, but
             as a doctor --

                           MIRANDA

             No, you're not. You're a close-
             minded academic, just like me.
             You told me once that I was the
             most logical person you knew,
             remember? Well, everything that's
             happened has an explanation but it
             has nothing to do with psychiatry
             or science. Rachel Parsons was
             abducted and she was murdered six
             years ago -- tossed off the Ashley
             Bridge by my husband. My
             harmless, righteous 'community
             leader' husband -- that's how
             pathetically blind I've been.

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)

             Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were
             also abducted and murdered -- now
             this was before I met Doug but I
             bet you anything that they both
             went to his school. Then he
             obviously stopped for a while:
             fear, guilt, distractions --
             namely me -- delayed him from
             reverting to his sickness. That's
             why I didn't notice anything. I
             believe he really tried to lead a
             normal life, for me. Then along
             comes Tracy Seaver and he can't
             resist. Locks her up and tortures
             her in some abandoned property --
She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing.

                           MIRANDA

             Here's Doug's interest in real
             estate, Pete.
Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek.

                           MIRANDA

             Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off
             ghost with an agenda, furious at
             her parents for giving up on
             her -- she's been trying to
             communicate with them for years
             but they're too goddamn logical to
             pay attention -- and she picked
             me, she sought me out that night
             and sent me home to fix her
             problem. Made sure I killed Doug
             because he was going to do the
             same thing to Tracy Seaver as he
             did to her. And she will get rid
             of anyone who stands in her way.
Pete takes all of this in.     Dumbfounded.

                           PETE

             Is that a threat?

                           MIRANDA

             To whom?

                           PETE

             To me.

CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             To you? I'm telling you she
             nearly electrocuted me when I
             tried to leave town and she led me
             to that barn and if I don't do
             what she wants -- she's going to
             kill me.
Pete can see that she's petrified. He starts to speak,
but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his
lips. The gesture is tender, almost romantic. A
reminder of their very real connection.

                           MIRANDA

             I need you to at least consider
             the possibility that I'm not
             insane.
                     (beat; pleading)
             Not as a doctor. As the only
             person I trust in this world.




EXT. NEWCASTLE COMMUNITY BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

A tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car.

                           DOROTHY

             I'm not doing it for Miranda, I'm
             doing this for Rachel.

                           PARSONS

             You're making a complete fool of
             yourself. Do you realize what you
             sound like?
She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there.
Takes three steps. Stops. Turns back around and lets
him have it:

                            DOROTHY

             What do I sound like, Phil? Like
             one of your patients? Well, it's
             probably because that's exactly
             how you treat me. And I've had
             enough of this deafening silence
             between us, this exemplary
             mourning in front of the
             community, tiptoeing around our
             lives with you pretending Rachel
             never existed.
BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument, pretending not
to hear. Phil is mortified. But Dorothy doesn't care:

                                               (CONTINUED)

             I'm losing my mind. Our daughter
             is gone and I miss her and I'm
             angry.



She turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the
first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car.




INT. BANK VAULT - DAY

A solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table
in the middle of the room. Steps back through the gate
and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a
moment.
Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife
and opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means
nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope. He
opens it and spills the contents on the table.
It is a stack of POLAROIDS.
Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens. She
grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit
down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes
out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales,
all blood draining from his face.







EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - EVENING

The sky darkens fast.     The storm moving in.




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NURSES' STATION

THUNDER RUMBLES outside, making a tray of meds rattle.
PAN UP to see Consuelo, the round black woman we might
remember Chloe beating up earlier. She shakes her head.

                           CONSUELO

             It's gonna be an interesting
             night.




INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL

Miranda looks up at the sound of the BOLT BEING DRAWN and
the handle unfastened. Through the door comes Consuelo,
carrying a tray. Sets it down by the bed.
She is on her way out when she pauses, stares at Miranda.

                           CONSUELO

             How are we doing today?
That term again, "we." Doctor-speak.         Miranda doesn't
have the energy for it:

                           MIRANDA

             Just fine, thank you.

                           CONSUELO

             The spirit is not fine.    She's
             very unhappy.
What was that? Normally Miranda would look at this woman
as if she were crazy, but things have changed.

                           MIRANDA

             How -- how do you know?

                            CONSUELO

                     (shuts her eyes)
             But she's only a girl. Do you
             know her name?

                              MIRANDA

             Yes.   Rachel.

                           CONSUELO

             Have you talked to her?

                           MIRANDA

             Yes, I -- you could say that.
Consuelo holds Miranda's hands firmly, "reading" her.

                           CONSUELO

             She's very, very angry. And she's
             not finished with you yet.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm sure that's meant to sound
             comforting but --

                           CONSUELO

             She wants to show you something.

                           MIRANDA

             That may be so, but I want her to
             go away.

                           CONSUELO

             Then you need to protect yourself.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          89.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             And how exactly would I do that?

                           CONSUELO

             Mira, first I'm gonna bring you
             some cascarilla, it's a powder,
             you get it anyplace, it comes from
             eggs -- you pour it all over
             you --
                     (indicates)
             Like this --

                           MIRANDA

             Look --
                     (reading nametag)
             Consuelo, I appreciate what you're
             trying to do, but I honestly don't
             think this ghost will go away if I
             pour some egg powder on myself --
Consuelo holds up a finger, hushing Miranda.      She's
receiving something here. Shudders.

                           CONSUELO

             She made you do things.   Bad
             things, didn't she?

                           MIRANDA

             Yes.

                           CONSUELO

             And you carried this out for her.
             She used you as a vessel...
Consuelo's grip tightens on Miranda as we --

                                         FLASH CUT TO:





FLASHBACK - EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

We're back at the bridge.     Rachel pries open Miranda's
mouth. Miranda panics:

                            MIRANDA

             What are you doing? I'm trying to
             help you -- ?!
Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda
screams, blood starts leaking out of Rachel's wounds.
And now we see it. Rachel's lips touch Miranda's and
BREATHE HER SPIRIT INTO Miranda with a WHOOSH --




                                                       90.





INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)




Consuelo lets go of Miranda's hand. Like recoiling from
fire. Speaks in the simplest of ways. The truth:

                         CONSUELO

           You were possessed by her.

                         MIRANDA

           Yes.

                         CONSUELO

           Ay, probrecita. You're both in
           terrible danger. She's scared too
           but she can't step back into the
           light until she finishes what she
           started here. And now you're the
           only person who can help her find
           the way back.

                         MIRANDA

           I don't know how to do that -- I'm
           not qualified for it. You do it.
Consuelo crosses herself. A sign of respect for the
situation. But it has a chilling effect on Miranda.

                         CONSUELO

           Despair is the only unforgivable
           sin. You'll be in my prayers,
           Miranda.
Prayers?   What good is that going to do?   Consuelo exits.




EXT. PARSONS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Two POLICE CRUISERS parked outside.







INT. PARSONS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A glassy-eyed Phil Parsons serves himself another Scotch,
devastated. The SHOT is FRAMED so that we see the
bedroom door is open, Dorothy lying in bed, heavily
tranquilized.
Sheriff Ryan inspects the photographs.

Postcards from hell: scared teenage girls in forced
poses -- gagged, tortured -- Andrea White, Jenny Dixon,

CONTINUED:




And young Rachel Parsons.

                           PARSONS

             This proves that her story is
             true: my daughter appeared to her
             in some form and guided her
             through all this, putting things
             right.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Come on, Phil, you of all
             people --

                           PARSONS

             I of all people hold logic, reason
             and facts above everything else.
             And seek the truth through proof
             and proof only.
                     (re: pictures)
             And what do you call that?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Has it occurred to you that maybe
             she knew what her husband was
             doing to those girls?

                            PARSONS

             No.   Frankly, it hasn't.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Maybe she couldn't stand the guilt
             and cooked up this far-fetched
             tale to tug at everybody's
             heartstrings. The fact remains
             she hacked her husband to pieces.

                           PARSONS

             The fact remains my daughter was
             murdered and Miranda stopped the
             killer. A killer who was loose
             under your incompetent nose for
             over six years. We don't know how
             many future victims were spared,
             but we do know she saved that girl
             in the barn's life. And that's
             more than you or I can say -- !

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Calm down. For the record, that
             girl is on a ventilator. The
             doctors don't think she'll make it
             through tonight.

                           SHERIFF RYAN (CONT'D)

             Now, you want to stand up in a
             courtroom and tell a judge that a
             ghost is behind all this, that's
             your prerogative -- but I have to
             abide by the law. And the law
             says Miranda Grey faces criminal
             chargers. So here's what we're
             going to do. I'm going to leave a
             cruiser outside to make sure you
             don't go anywhere tonight and two
             of my deputies will go guard Ms.
             Grey until tomorrow morning.
             Phil?
Parsons doesn't respond.     His eyes far away.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             There will be no breakouts, no
             aiding and abetting, no taking the
             law into your own hands. It'll
             take an Act of God for Miranda
             Grey not to show up in that
             courtroom tomorrow. Are we clear?
And now the Sheriff can see that Parsons is crying.
Quietly, miserably. And it's a disparaging sight.
Sheriff Ryan exits. Two deputies follow, RADIOS

SQUAWKING.

Parsons remains still for a moment, then digs a
photograph out of a drawer. A picture of Rachel in
happier times.

                           PARSONS

             I'm sorry. I will never forgive
             myself for what happened to you.
             Not as long as I live.
                     (breaking down)
             I miss you so much.
He sits there, staring at his dead daughter. Grieving.
WE PULL BACK to see he is not alone. Rachel is watching
him.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

The WIND has really PICKED UP now. A massive LIGHTNING
BOLT streaks the sky, officially announcing the storm's
onset.
A POLICE CRUISER pulls up to the guard gate.




                                                            93.





INT. WOODWARD SURVEILLANCE BOOTH




PAN OFF the bank of monitors TO the same two guards we've
seen before. Playing yet another bored card game. The
LIGHT RAPPING on their glass door makes them look up.




                             GUARD #1

             Help you?
TWO OFFICERS stand there.       We recognize one of them:

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             We're here on Miranda Grey detail.
The Guards shake their heads, chuckle.

                           GUARD #1

             Sixth floor. You can get a couple
             chairs from the nurses up there.
             A pretty decent cup of joe too.

                             OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Thanks, guys.
The Guard points at the bank of monitors.

                           GUARD #1

             Although why the Sheriff is making
             you fellas waste your time is
             beside me. We got her right here.
             She ain't going no place.




ON MONITOR

Miranda inside her pristine white cell.       Restlessly
pacing.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Looks perfectly harmless, doesn't
             she?

                           GUARD #1

             Don't they all, Officer, don't
             they all?
The men share a chuckle over that one when suddenly
THUNDER CRACKLES and the power goes out.
No monitors, no radio, no nothing.       Pitch black.

                            GUARD #1

             Shit.   There goes the card game.
Abruptly there's a SERIES OF sharp CLICKS as FOUR
FLASHLIGHTS come alive.




                                                        94.





INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL




The THUNDER outside RATTLES the WINDOW PANE. The only
light source being the intermittent LIGHTNING as the

STORM RAGES.




She paces in the dark.    Sits.   Waits.




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - STAIRS - SAME TIME

The two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs.







INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME




Miranda holds her breath, listens. And sure enough,
somebody else is in the room. She looks around.

                          MIRANDA

          No.   No.   What do you want -- ?
And now LIGHTNING streaks the room and we see Rachel in
the corner. Staring with her dead eyes. Moving towards
her.

                         MIRANDA

          I've done everything you've asked
          me to. My life is ruined. I
          can't take this anymore. I
          can't...
                   (faintly)
          You have to step into the light,
          Rachel. You don't belong here --
          you don't belong...
But it doesn't work. Rachel keeps walking towards her.
Miranda backs up against the wall. Trapped. Fighting
tears --

                        MIRANDA

          Into the light --
                  (loudly)
          Can somebody come in here?       I need
          help. Somebody, please!




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DIFFERENT FLOOR - STAIRS -


SAME TIME

The cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights
down the corridor. They walk towards them.

                        IRENE

          And who are you?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        95.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Officer Turlington, ma'am. We're
             supposed to sit outside Miranda
             Grey's cell all night.




                           IRENE

             Knock yourself out. Next floor up.
                     (loudly)
             It's only a power outage, ladies
             -- let's call it an early night.
The cops head down the corridor.




INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME

Rachel stretches out her arm to Miranda's face --

                           MIRANDA

             Please don't. Why are you doing
             this? It's over. Over and done!
Rachel slowly shakes her head, places her hands on
Miranda's eyes and shuts them --

                                       FLASH CUT TO:








MIRANDA'S VISION - ANDREA WHITE

in her school uniform. Staring straight ahead. Now the
image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her
half-naked, bruised. Dead.

                                       FLASH CUT TO:





JENNY DIXON

staring AT us in her school uniform. Now abruptly she is
a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also
bathed in the strange red and blue light --

END OF MIRANDA'S VISION.





INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda screams at the visions.    Rachel holds her steady.

                          MIRANDA

             Stop it! I don't want to see
             this! I can't help you anymore!
             Stop it!

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                        96.





CONTINUED:




Now a heavy RATTLING makes her turn to the door. One of
the HINGES has SHATTERED and the latch itself is half-
pulled from the doorframe. Relentless POUNDING on the
other side.




                           MIRANDA

             Let me out of here! Let me out!
There's a deafening SOUND like a thousand bells ringing
at once and Miranda covers her ears --
Outside WE HEAR MURMURS, YELLS, INSTRUCTIONS --




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR

The cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung
open. Confused patients spill out as guards and nurses
try to restore order. RADIOS SQUAWK, flashlights beam
and FOOTSTEPS fill the dark corridor as patients try to
escape.







EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

FIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS
blazing. Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from
their cars to contain the breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT
comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run for the garden
wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush
after her.




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE

Sheriff Ryan makes his way through the mayhem, past Irene
helping a patient, past nurse Claire cowering in a corner --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Christ Almighty.
Sheriff Ryan hits the stairs.




INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

Officer Turlington runs down the corridor, searching
frantically with his flashlight --




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

A car pulls up at the scene.     Pete and Parsons step out.

             Miranda...
Pete rushes up the steps --







INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

Officer Turlington looks inside Miranda's cell. Empty.
And as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her:
Seated by the elevator. Holding a biting block in
Shelley's mouth as her seizing subsides.

                           OFFICER

                     (into radio)
             Sheriff? I have Miss Grey right
             here.
He flashes his light at her.     Miranda looks back blankly.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sorry, we thought you might have
             made a run for it.

                           MIRANDA

             Page Irene ASAP. This patient
             needs her meds.
Turlington nods. Miranda looks down at a grateful
Shelley, whose head is cradled in her lap. Brushes the
matted hair off her face. Carefully removes the biting
block, making sure Shelley is alright.

                           SHELLEY

                     (after a beat)
             You're gonna get that Pulitzer
             after all.

                           MIRANDA

             Shh, shh, just rest.

                           SHELLEY

                     (sotto, smiling)
             I told you I could keep a secret.







INT. REC ROOM - LATER

The patients are all assembled here. Flashlights galore.
Irene and Consuelo do head counts. Guards, officers,
janitors -- everybody. Irene points a finger at Jenna.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         98.





CONTINUED:





                           IRENE

             You have really disappointed me
             tonight, Jenna --




                           JENNA

             Give me a break. You wouldn't
             respect me if I hadn't tried --
Parsons breaks away from Turlington, heads over to Pete
and Miranda --

                           PETE

             Everybody accounted for?

                           PARSONS

             We're doing the final count.   Now
             they can't find the Sheriff.
Miranda scans the near-dark room, looking for someone.
Watches Turlington step aside to take a call on his
radio.   Parsons regards her with newfound respect:

                           PARSONS

             Are you alright, Miranda?

                            MIRANDA

             Fine, Phil.   Thanks for asking.
Suddenly all the policemen in the room begin to exit --

                           PETE

             What's going on, Officer?

                            OFFICER TURLINGTON

             One of your patients is holding
             the Sheriff at gunpoint. She's in
             the cafeteria.
Pete glances at Miranda.      She knows exactly who it is:

                           MIRANDA

             Chloe.
Turlington is about to exit when Parsons stops him:

                           PARSONS

             I think Doctor Grey should be the
             one to talk to her.




INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

The DOOR CRASHES open and Chloe shoves the Sheriff
inside. She has a gun pressed hard against his ear.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          99.





CONTINUED:





                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Young lady, I don't know how you
             think you can get out of here,
             but --




                           CHLOE

             You're very polite for a piggy.
             Now take off your uniform.
Sheriff Ryan hesitates.      Chloe presses the gun against
him.

                            CHLOE

             Do it quick.   I won't make fun of
             you.
The sound of the UPSTAIRS DOOR BEING THROWN OPEN makes
her glance up. She trains her flashlight at the second
level, stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover.

                           CHLOE

             Nobody better fucking move up
             there or I'll blow this piggy's
             head off!
Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM searches the section. Catches the
reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table.

                           CHLOE

             That means you, fucko. Up on your
             feet or I'll start by shooting his
             ear off.
A beat.   Officer Turlington rises.      Slow and deliberate.

                           CHLOE

                     (to Sheriff, sotto)
             Tell junior the grownups are
             talking now and he's not allowed
             in here. Do it.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Turlington, it's alright. I
             can -- I'm just going to --

                            CHLOE

             The grownups are talking.   Don't
             paraphrase me.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             The grownups are -- are talking
             now. Just leave.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                          100.





CONTINUED:




A voice startles Chloe from behind, at floor level.

                            MIRANDA

             Chloe?   Can I talk to you?



Chloe flicks the flashlight to see Miranda by the door.

                           CHLOE

             Dreadful timing, I'm real busy.

                           MIRANDA

             You have to let him go.   I'm sorry.
Chloe flinches at that. Like all this multitasking is
affecting her. She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriff's
neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style --

                           CHLOE

             Look -- let's not confuse things.
             I like you. But this is my only
             chance.
                     (to Sheriff)
             Now take off that goddamn uniform
             before I get really pissed.
The Sheriff glances at Miranda. Miranda nods.       The
Sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt --

                           MIRANDA

             What are you going to do? Put on
             his uniform and walk out of here?
             Think about it, Chloe. They know
             you have him. The place is
             crawling with cops.

                           CHLOE

             What are my options? To grow old
             in this place? It's clear they will
             never let me go. Never. Ever.

                           MIRANDA

             That's not true. You have less
             than a year left here.

                           CHLOE

             That's a lie! I'll never stop
             being sick, they'll just find
             something new that's wrong with
             me. No wonder you doctors can't
             help anyone -- all you have are
             deficit columns and stupid tests
             designed to point out what part of
             the puzzle you think we're missing!

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         101.





CONTINUED:




She starts sobbing.     Letting everything go --

                           MIRANDA

             You're right, doctors never
             concentrate on the things patients
             are actually capable of. But I
             know you, Chloe, you've been
             through things that most people
             don't survive. And you have a
             wonderful future in front of you
             if you choose it. It's up to you.
This gets through to Chloe.       Her grip loosens on the gun.

                           MIRANDA

             No more guilt, no more hatred, no
             more unbearable sadness. You have
             no use for any of that anymore.
             Your life begins this very second.

                             CHLOE

             I'm so tired.    So goddamn tired --
Miranda walks over and embraces her.       Chloe hands her the
gun.
And that's when the power returns.
Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan
on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning
light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every
RADIO, PHONE, FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO

LIFE.

Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in
the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the
cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea
White and Jenny Dixon visions.
Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning
of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the
Sheriff, finally struck with the realization:

                           MIRANDA

             It was you, wasn't it?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             What are you talking about?
She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup-
style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES, ARMS RAISED, SHACKLED.
Anima Sola. Miranda's recurring vision from the night of
the slaughter.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        102.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             'Not alone.' That's what Rachel
             has been trying to tell me all
             along. Doug was not alone. You
             were with him. This whole time
             it's been you. You covered up
             their deaths to look like
             suicides.
The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You've lost your mind.

                           MIRANDA

             Don't fucking move.
The CLICK! of a SAFETY being released makes him pause.
He turns to look at her. A tense beat.

                           PETE (O.S.)

             Miranda, don't do it!
She glances at Pete's pleading face and the room around
her: cops everywhere. All guns trained on her.
Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the
following:

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             And just exactly who would believe
             you? No proof, no living witness.
             Everybody knows you're crazy.
Miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off.
Her hand starts to shake. Sheriff Ryan turns and strides
off. Getting away. Further. Further...
But as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to
do it. Finally brings the gun down. The armed policemen
rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff
her.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             I want that woman in custody. She
             has a judge to face in the morning.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT (HEAVY RAIN)

Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser.
He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when
Pete suddenly taps on Miranda's window, startling her --

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         103.





CONTINUED:





                           PETE

             I'll call your lawyer and -- !

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sir, not now --

                           PETE

             I'll meet you at the station!
She shakes her head.     Mouths something Pete can't make out.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sir, please --

                           PETE

             What?
Turlington hits the gas. Miranda presses her face
against the window so only Pete can see her say the
following:

                           MIRANDA

             The girl in the hospital.
Pete locks eyes with her, nods -- as the cruiser leaves.




INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - RECOVERING ROOM - NIGHT

Tracy Seaver lies unconscious, hooked up to a series of
machines. PULL BACK to find Pete with a young DOCTOR.

                           DOCTOR

             Her condition remains the same.
             Basically that ventilator is
             keeping her alive. We have no
             reason to think she'll ever wake
             up. I'm sorry.
Pete nods, disconcerted.      Stares at the girl.

                           PETE

             You mind if I stay here tonight?

                           DOCTOR

             Hey, it's a big place. The more
             the merrier. If I can just ask
             you to wait outside.







INT. WAITING AREA

The Doctor gestures for Pete to make himself comfortable.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                           104.





CONTINUED:





                           HOSPITAL LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)

             Dr. Brooks to ER. Dr. Brooks --

                            DOCTOR

             That's me.   Excuse me.
The Doctor rushes off.




INT. RECOVERY ROOM #2

Like Tracy Seaver, Simon Reynolds is hooked up to a bunch
of machines and cables. Suddenly his EYES SHOOT OPEN and
the CARDIAC ALARM SQUEALS --
Two NURSES rush in.       The young Doctor right behind.

                            NURSE #1

             V-tach.
The EKG whipsaws. The Doctor feels for a pulse, then slaps
on the defibrillator pads, places the paddles on the chest --

                            DOCTOR

             Clear!
He begins chest compressions on Simon's heart. He spasms
violently once, twice -- And then it stops. The Doctor
and Nurses stare at the monitor. Flatline.
Unseen by them, Rachel steps out of the room.







EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

WE SEE Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol
car and drive off. WE MOVE INSIDE the empty station...




INT. SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE

Sheriff Ryan takes a healthy chug from a fifth of Scotch,
slips it back in a drawer. Stares at his hands. Steady as
a rock. Takes a deep breath. Knows what he must do next.
A religious man despite everything, he brings his thumb
to his forehead and crosses himself.




INT. COUNTY STATION - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER

Miranda's eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS
SLIDING UNLOCKED. Hopeful. Could this be Rachel?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         105.





CONTINUED:




A looming figure appears at the door. Doesn't bother to
shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And
so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:




                           SHERIFF RYAN

             How did you know?

                            MIRANDA

             You tell me.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             This isn't one of your word
             association games, Doctor. Did
             Douglas tell you that night?

                           MIRANDA

             Why wait this long if he had?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Maybe it's your amnesia. Maybe
             you blocked it out.

                           MIRANDA

             Maybe. But it seems to me that
             it's vital you know for sure.
He studies her. Takes a step towards her. Miranda
responds by stepping back. A slow motion semicircle, if
you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You think me and Doug are
             monsters. That this was all a
             carefully laid out plan with those
             girls. But it wasn't that at all.
             You do things sometimes and you're
             not sure why you did them. Then
             you realize you can live with them
             and so can everyone else. Life
             goes on.

                           MIRANDA

             If you're looking for forgiveness,
             you came to the wrong place.
She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows
it.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             One thing about fear is it makes
             people say the dumbest things.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       106.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             Be that as it may, you're afraid
             too -- because you know killing me
             won't solve your problems.




                           SHERIFF RYAN

             My only problem is you.

                           MIRANDA

             What about Parsons? And Peter?
             They know. And that girl in the
             hospital will never forget your
             face. You miscalculated, now you
             pay.
Patience tested, he suddenly WHACKS her across the face.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             I hate a bad bluffer.
She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung.

                           MIRANDA

             I sure hope that felt good because
             you can't afford too many more
             signs of struggle. Can you?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Go ahead, hit me back. It's what
             you want.

                           MIRANDA

             No, that's what you want me to do.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Back to profiling, huh? Your
             thought process is completely
             transparent.
And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the
conversation. Analyst and patient in session.      Echoing
her opening scene with Chloe.

                           MIRANDA

             So we're even. You left that door
             open so I'd try and run, it's what
             you get off on, isn't it?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             I guess we'll find out.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                        107.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             And yet you have to make me look
             like a suicide. With what, your
             belt?
                     (off his shrug)
             How would I get access to a belt?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Trust me, prisoners hang themselves
             with just about anything.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't think that's going to
             satisfy you. You won't be able to
             do this clean. You have too much
             guilt inside.
SMACK! Another slap across the face. Miranda's knees
buckle. But she remains standing. Her lip trembles.

                           MIRANDA

             You're losing grasp of the
             situation. It was different with
             those girls. I bet all they did
             was cry and scream.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Don't worry, you'll scream.
                     (after a beat)
             Take off your shirt.
This throws her off.     She shoots a quick glance at the
door.

                           MIRANDA

             Aren't I a little old for you?

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Take it off.
She hesitates.    He draws his gun, tired.    Removes the
safety.

                           MIRANDA

             That's for show. You know you
             can't shoot me.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             But I can smash your teeth out and
             make it look like you bashed your
             head against the wall. Now shut
             up, take off your goddamn shirt
             and pull off your bra.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                          108.





CONTINUED:




Miranda is petrified now.      Running out of ways to hide
it.

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Today, Doctor.
In a sudden move, Miranda shoves the chair at him and
bolts out the door. The Sheriff doesn't move to stop
her.




INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape. Takes
quick inventory of the space: two more holding cells
like her own, a row of filing cabinets, and a storage
area with barred windows. She makes a turn up ahead and
reaches another gate down the corridor. A sliding gate
that closes off the cell area from the main station.
She tries the gate. Locked, naturally.       She shakes and
bangs on it, desperate.

                            MIRANDA


             TURLINGTON!!   SOMEBODY HELP ME!!

No response. And no way to disguise the sheer panic in
her voice. She fell for his trap. They're all alone
here.







INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - SAME TIME

Ryan smiles at that. Re-holsters his weapon and walks
towards her, taking his time. Relishing the hunt.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Doug mentioned you were painfully
             'modest.' But enough about you,
             let's discuss Rachel.




INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Now Miranda searches for a place to hide.        His FOOTSTEPS

GETTING CLOSER --


                           SHERIFF RYAN (O.S.)

             She was no crippled saint. Wasn't
             the first time she turned up at
             Doug's house all messed up.




                                                     109.





ANOTHER ANGLE




Sheriff Ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw
Miranda. The gate still locked. She's not there. He
traces her steps, clearly enjoying this:




                        SHERIFF RYAN

          Sure she was a minor, but she
          wasn't going to let that get in
          her way.




INT. STORAGE AREA - SAME TIME

Miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk. The SHOT
is FRAMED so we can see the doorway. She prays silently:

                        MIRANDA

                  (sotto)
          Rachel, where are you when I need
          you?
Clearly not here.   Sheriff Ryan's voice getting closer:

                        SHERIFF RYAN (O.S.)

          Those other girls -- make no
          mistake -- they knew what they
          were getting into.
He appears at the doorway now, peeks inside the room.
Sensing her in there. Miranda holds her breath.

                        SHERIFF RYAN

          I'm not saying they knew they were
          going to die, but truth is, Doug and
          I didn't know it was going to end that
          way. It was just the natural extension
          of that moment. So yeah, we fucked
          them and we killed them. And we knew
          it was wrong. Sure we did.
He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a
CLANGING SOUND. Miranda wasn't underneath that one. She
scrambles to the door behind him as he turns --







INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to
slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly
SMASHES OPEN against her, knocking her backwards onto the
floor --
He looms over her. She reaches around for anything to
defend herself. Nothing there. Game over --

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                       110.





CONTINUED:





                             SHERIFF RYAN

             It wasn't some satanic pact,
             society didn't make us do it. But
             I believe given the proper
             circumstances a person is capable
             of anything -- certainly in my
             line of work you see it day in,
             day out.
                      (beat)
             Tell you what, keep the shirt.
             The bra will do.
Miranda stares, helpless. The Sheriff gestures for her
to begin. Like he has all the time in the world.
Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra
under her shirt. Petrified --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Chin up, Doctor. You wanted to
             get to the bottom of this and you
             did. You followed it all the way
             through. This is how it ends.
His demeanor and voice are eerily calm,    as if in a
trance. He takes the bra from her hand     and hangs it
around her neck, as if helping somebody    with their tie.
She takes a step back and finds herself    pinned against
the wall --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Doug settled down once you two got
             married. New start and all that.
             Wanted nothing to do with this
             runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver --
He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking
her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole
body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking
uncontrollably --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Or so he claimed. Because the
             truth, Doc -- is people never
             change. The son of a bitch
             couldn't resist. I asked him to
             dump the body and instead he went
             found some barn to work her out of
             his system some more. Go fucking
             figure.
And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so
slowly reach for his holster...

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         111.





CONTINUED:





                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You can't count on anyone, even
             friends you've had your whole
             life.



They're so close together their noses nearly touch. He
gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He
applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin
to the point of no return --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             The only soul you can ever count
             on is yourself --
BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a
gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet,
dazed.
He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him.
Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on
his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Why, Doctor.   That was unexpected.
He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes
her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the
trigger --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You sure about this?
He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his
head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's
open cell, weighing his options at triple speed --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You need me alive for your story
             to stick. Be logical now. You
             know you can't kill me.
He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills
a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays
backwards and lands with a crash.

                           MIRANDA

             Logic is overrated.




INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

The door to Tracy's room is closed. WE FIND Pete where
we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                      112.





CONTINUED:




MOVING TOWARD him, we COME TO REST ON the back of his
neck. So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back
of his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold
whisper, they stand up on their ends.



Pete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now
open. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door.




INT. RECOVERY ROOM #1

Pete looks oddly around the room.

                           PETE

             Anybody in here -- ?
As he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room.
Unseen by him, of course. Pete starts to exit when Tracy
opens her eyes. Groggily waking as if from a dream.

                             TRACY SEAVER

             Hello -- ?







EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of
take-out food. Chatting with his colleagues.




INT. HALLWAY TO SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it.

                             OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sheriff Ryan?
No sight of the man.  That's odd. Maybe he's in the
bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction.




INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Turlington peeks in.      checks the stalls.

                             OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sheriff?
Nobody. He notices the back window is open because
raindrops are blown in by the wind. He looks out to the
parking lot for a moment before shutting it.




                                                      113.





INT. POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR




The FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete,
Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area.

                        FRONT DESK OFFICER

          I'm sorry, but nobody is allowed
          to visit at this hour --

                        PETE

          Is the Sheriff here or isn't he?

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

                  (reaching the scene)
          Help you, gentlemen?

                        PETE

          We're here to see Miranda Grey.

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          You know full well you're not
          allowed to see --
Teddy Howard slaps an official-looking document on him.

                        TEDDY HOWARD

          That's straight from Judge
          Wilkinson. Take us to her cell.

                        FRONT DESK OFFICER

          Better get the Sheriff out here.
Turlington looks over the paperwork, confused.

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          Sheriff Ryan isn't here. His car
          is gone too.

                        PARSONS

          Officer, unlock the goddamn door
          to Miranda's cell or I'll break it
          down myself.
Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way,
certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric
institutes. He leads the men down the corridor and
unlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are
dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open.
The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.




INT. HOLDING CELL

Sheriff Ryan, splayed.   Very dead.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                           114.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Jesus H. Christ.
Teddy Howard has to look away. Pete places his hand on
Parsons' shoulder. Parsons simply glares at the dead
man, eyes filled with hatred.
No sign of Miranda anywhere.        Vanished.   Like Houdini.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:





EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

CAMERA SOARS THROUGH the tall gates, PAST the guard, PAST
the sprinklers watering the impressive gardens. A
TAXICAB pulls up.

SUPERIMPOSE:     SIX MONTHS LATER

A healthier, much happier-looking Chloe shakes Pete's
hand at the front steps. Small suitcase by her side.

                           CHLOE

             Thank you for everything, Dr.
             Graham. I'll never forget all
             you've done for me.

                           PETE

             It's been my pleasure, Miss
             McGrath. Good luck out there.
Chloe smiles.     Awkward.   Her first day out in the real
world.

                           CHLOE

             Well, I guess this is it. I hope
             not to see you again unless it's
             for coffee or something.

                           PETE

             Hey, you never know. It's a small
             world, unless you have to clean it.
Chloe picks up her bag, climbs down the steps to her cab.
Stops midway, turns:

                           CHLOE

             You don't have to tell me if you
             don't want to, but -- have you
             ever heard anything from -- ?
Pete shakes his head. Chloe nods, climbs inside the cab.
Pete waves as it drives off. Then he pulls out a postcard
from his pocket. It has a New York City postmark.




                                                      115.





INSERT - POSTCARD





                        MIRANDA (V.O.)

          Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on
          both feet, preferably having been
          promoted to director after Phil's
          retirement. Not that you had much
          competition, but a big hug to you
          anyway... I was as surprised as
          anyone to read about Sheriff
          Ryan's suicide and the startling
          discovery that it was he who
          murdered my late husband. I wish
          I could personally thank certain
          people for their convincing
          testimonies in the case.

          As for myself, I have a new name
          now and a job working with teenage
          girls at a runaway shelter, trying
          to keep an open mind at the
          horrors they tell me...







EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

BOOM DOWN TO a young woman kneeling down to set flowers
on a grave and we recognize her as Tracy Seaver.
Shockingly cleaned up and properly attired -- she's even
cute.

                        MIRANDA (V.O.)

          Which reminds me: Consuelo the
          Cuban witch is a keeper, don't
          fire her. She knows things about
          the world you and I don't.

PULL BACK to see the gave is Rachel's, and it is
positively overflowing with flowers. She's become
something of a cause celeb in these parts. Tracy walks
back to the retired couple holding hands, Phil and
Dorothy Parsons.

                           MIRANDA (V.O.)

             Well, gotta run now, I have some
             country songs to write and lots of
             social invites to decline...
STILL PULLING BACK THROUGH the lush cemetery, PAST
several trees until we find Rachel watching the serene
scene. She turns TO CAMERA now and we PUSH INTO her
eyes, finally at peace, until it FILLS the SCREEN and in
it we see...




EXT. BLEEKER STREET (NYC) - DAY

Miranda walking among the throng of pedestrians. She
looks confident, relaxed, down to earth. No longer the
tightly wound professional at the beginning of our story.

             P.S. And in case you're wondering
             what the chances are of me buying
             you a beer and maybe finishing
             something we almost started, the
             answer is: it's just not going to
             happen. Especially not at
             McSorley's next Friday night. Say
             around nine. So you probably
             shouldn't bother showing up. All
             my love, M.G.
She turns at the light and gets lost in the crowd.

          1   INT. PETER & MARIA'S BEDROOM - DAY                               1
          
              FADE IN on MARIA (late 20s), asleep in bed. She's
              breathtakingly beautiful. Morning light fills the room.      The
              sound of wind, and rippling cloth.
          
              Maria stirs, and opens her eyes.     She stretches contentedly.
          
              Then she frowns.    Rolls over.    She's alone in the bed?
          
              No, she's not: PETER (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her.
              Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him.
          
                                     MARIA
                        Hey.     Are you okay?
          
              Peter doesn't turn. He slowly stands and walks forward
              towards an OPEN WINDOW.
          
              There's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly,
              almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles.
          
              Maria gets out of bed, concerned.
          
                                    MARIA
                        Peter?    What's the matter?
          
              He pauses at the window.    Turns his head to look back at her.
          
              His eyes are vacant.    His face is a blank.
          
              Then Peter slowly leans forward.     And falls from the window.
          
              Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from
              outside reaches her ears. Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from below.
          
              Aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards
              the window. We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL --
          
              -- PETER'S BODY lies in the middle of the street.     His head
              has burst open, his body broken and twisted.
          
              ON THE PAVEMENT: a line of blood appears, moving down the
              center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see --
          
              -- the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS.
              A translation appears over them: "The Grudge."

              A blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a
              subway tunnel. Most are Japanese. We're not in Kansas.

               Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is
          
               KAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for
               someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a
               heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.
          
                                   DOUG (O.S.)
                         Karen!
          
               She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American)
               approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand --
          
               -- and together, they force their way through the throng,
               trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by
               the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer.
          
                                   KAREN
                         I'll never get used to this.
          
                                   DOUG
                         Maybe we should find a different
                         train station.
          
               He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still
               holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on.
               She sees the smile on his lips a moment before --
          
               -- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the
               crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all.
          
               It's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   But
               then she pulls away, shy.
          
                                   KAREN
                         A public display of affection is
                         considered rude in Japan.
          
               There's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET.   Doug and Karen
               deftly slip out of the traffic --
          
          
          2a                                                                 2a

               -- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away
               from the crowded thoroughfare.
          
               Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES,
               making out on the street corner. He turns to give Karen a
               sarcastic look --
          
                                  Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      2A.
          
          
          
          -- but she didn't notice the school kids. She's looking in
          the other direction, at a trickle of SMOKE wafting up over a
          nearby fence.
          
                              KAREN
                    What's that?
          
          Doug follows as she walks toward an OLD TEMPLE, nestled
          beneath a skyscraper. A collision of the ancient and modern.
          The fence surrounds a GRAVEYARD adjacent to the temple.
          
                              DOUG
                    We walk past this temple every day,
                    Karen --
          
                              KAREN
                    Yeah, but I've never seen this
                    before.
          
          A JAPANESE MAN stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a
          bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.
          
                              KAREN
                    It's a Buddhist ritual. The
                    incense smoke carries the prayers
                    to the spirits of his ancestors, to
                    help them remain at peace.
          
          CLINK. She turns as Doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with
          his Zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it.
          
                              DOUG
                    It's amazing. You're like this
                    infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or
                    trivia. I'm not sure which.
          
                              KAREN
                    It's not trivia. It's what they
                    believe. And it's far better, by
                    the way, than your little pollution
                    ritual.
          
          Doug's grin softens to a smile. He doesn't respond... but
          the way he's looking at Karen makes her curious:
          
                              KAREN
                    What?
          
          He turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his
          cigarette and crushing it. Finally:

                    Nothing. I just -- I like that
                    about you. You seem to be able to
                    remember everything that's really
                    important.
          
          She smiles.   A tender moment.   Then... he checks his watch.
          
                              DOUG
                    Except the time.
          
          Karen checks her own watch, realizing --
          
                              KAREN
                    Oh, crap --
          
          She grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly.
          
                              KAREN
                    C'mon, you're gonna be late.

                An international college in Tokyo. The autumn chill doesn't
                deter the students from enjoying the beautiful day.
          
                Karen and Doug, still holding hands, enter the campus.

                Karen and Doug approach the doors of a NURSING CARE CENTER.
                She pulls him to the side just as he's stepping under a
                WORKMAN'S LADDER by the doors.
          
                                    KAREN
                          Uh-uh. Seven years of bad luck.
                              (before Doug can respond:)
                          And I might have a vested interest
                          in those years.
          
                                    DOUG

                          Maybe.
          
                Doug smiles, kissing her romantically.   Then:
          
                                    DOUG

                With a flourish, Doug SWINGS HIMSELF back under the ladder.

          Then Karen walks through the doors into a bright, atrium-like
          lobby area. She waves "hello" to the RECEPTIONIST.

          Leaning against a desk behind Reception is Karen's boss ALEX
          (40s, American). He's got a phone to his ear -- it's
          ringing. An ANSWERING MACHINE picks up in Japanese.
          
          Alex mutters and hangs up.   Then he notices --

                    Karen!
          
          She's started up a STAIRCASE in the center of the lobby.   She
          turns and comes back down, walking over to Alex.
          
                              ALEX

                    "Mild dementia with severe
                    lethargy." Apparently she sleeps
                    through most of the day. Her
                    daughter-in-law doesn't work, so
                    she'll probably be there.
          
          Karen seems unsure.   It's a big step for her.
          
                              ALEX
                    You're the one who's been bugging
                    me about getting out there on your
                    own. Besides, it's an English-only
                    house.
          
          One of Alex's CO-WORKERS appears in the doorway, motioning to
          him. Alex quickly hands Karen a card:

                    Here's the address. Use the wall
                    chart if you need help -- and don't
                    forget to bring a map.

                THE WALL CHART: a color-coded diagram shows how the long
                address string is broken down into Postal Code, Prefecture,

                Karen nods.   But she's not quite as confident.

                Karen sits uncomfortably on the crowded transit car, squeezed
                in tightly by the people around her. The LOUD CRYING of a
                baby adds to her discomfort.

                She pauses, looking at the address on her card. She
                approaches a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER (6) and speaks to them in
                Japanese. The woman nods, pointing towards a small ALLEY.
          
                Karen gives the daughter a smile;   the girl hides behind her
                mother's leg.

               -- it's THE HOUSE.   Cozy and shaded, nestled into the dead
               end of the street.   Large by Tokyo standards.
          
               She double-checks the address and opens the gate, walking
               around a BICYCLE leaning against the wall and following the
               stepping-stone path to the front door. She knocks. No
               answer. She tries again. Nothing.
          
               Then, an afterthought, she tries the handle.   It's unlocked.

               A SCRAPING sound grabs Karen's attention.
          
               HER POV: at the far end of the room, a FROSTED-GLASS PANELED
               DOOR leads to an adjacent room.
          
               A HAND is visible on the other side, clawing at the glass.

               EMMA (60s, American). The older woman in the picture from
               Karen's file. She's lying on her stomach on a stained
               mattress, feebly looking up at Karen.

                         name is Karen. Do you remember?
                         I'm from the Health Center. I'm

                         How'd this happen, Emma?
                             (still no reaction)
                         Would you like a bath? Maybe that
                         will help you feel better.

               the couch for the missing piece. Can't see anything.
          
               She lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling
               around. Nothing.
          
               Karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining...
          
               She suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing.   She has a small
               cut on her finger.

               As she looks for an outlet, she hears a SCRATCHING SOUND.

               Karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty
               shelf. It's a BLACK CERAMIC CAT. Facing the wall. Strange.

               The sounds are coming from the room by the stairs.
          
               Karen walks to the door. She pauses, disturbed by the eerie
               sounds from inside. Then she reaches for the doorknob.
          
               THUD. THUD. Karen hesitates. The strange rhythmic THUDDING
               continues, coming from beyond the door.
          
                                   KAREN
                             (nervous:)
                         Hello?
          
               Karen takes a breath.   And turns the doorknob.
          
          19                                                                19
               INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DUSK
               The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER
               BEDROOM. It's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. A
               frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much.
          
               She stands there for a moment, listening.   Silence.
          
               Then --
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     12.
          
          
          
               SCRATCH SCRATCH. Startled, she gasps and turns towards THE
               CLOSED CLOSET DOORS. That's where the sound is coming from.
          
               And then she notices something strange about the closet door:
          
               It's been sealed shut with duct tape.
          
               The SCRATCHING quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby.
          
               And then there's a muffled MEOW.   There's a cat in there?
          
               Karen pulls off the duct tape. She reaches for the door
               handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside --
          
               The closet seems empty, except for a large BOOK on a shelf.
               Karen reaches inside and picks it up.
          
               Then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a
               SMALL BLACK CAT. It's sitting on something, watching her.
          
               Karen slides the door the rest of the way open --
          
               -- revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY (age 7) sitting in the
               corner, staring at Karen. The cat is curled up on his lap.
          
               Startled, Karen drops the book and falls backwards.
          
          20                                                                20
               INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
               Karen is on her cell phone:
          
                                   KAREN (INTO PHONE)
                         Yes, he was shut in a closet!
                         There was tape around the -- No,
                         they're not home yet. I don't
                         know, Emma hasn't said a word to me
                         -- He's still upstairs -- yes, I'm
                         sure he's Japanese -- But -- Yes,
                         alright, Alex. Just please get
                         here as soon as you can.
          
               Karen hangs up, putting the phone down on the kitchen table.
               She leans against the counter, exasperated.
          
               Then her attention turns to THE BOOK she found in the closet.
          
               Karen can't resist.   She opens it.
          
               THE BOOK is a large journal, filled with elegant Japanese
               writing. Karen flips through it, stopping on --
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        13.
          
          
          
               A PHOTOGRAPH.   A handsome young man, smiling at the camera.
          
               We recognize him.   It's PETER, from the opening scene.
          
          
          21   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                             21
          
               Karen walks to the front door, reaching out to unlock it --
          
               -- but she pauses, realizing something.
          
               She reaches into her pocket, pulling out THE PHOTO she found.
               It only takes a second to verify --
          
               -- THE BOY in the photo is the one she found in the closet.
          
               Karen lowers the photo, bewildered.    Then she looks up,
               startled by --
          
               THE BOY. He's kneeling on the second floor landing above,
               watching her through the bars of the metal railing. Creepy.
          
               Karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile.
          
                                   KAREN (IN JAPANESE)
                         Hello there.
          
                                              Really creepy.
               The boy just stares at her.
                                   KAREN (IN JAPANESE)
                         My name is Karen. What's yours?
          
                                    THE BOY
                         Toshio.
          
               Before she can respond --
          
               RING! RING!   The phone in the next room startles her.
          
          22                                                                 22
               INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
               Karen enters the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks up, the
               voices of a happy couple on the GREETING (in English):
          
                                   MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE)
                         "Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer
                         aren't around, leave a message."
          
                                   SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                         "Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are
                         you there? Pick up...
                                   (MORE)
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       14.
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE) (cont'd)
                          Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so
                          you can try my cell, or just call
                          me at home later."
          
               The caller pauses. Karen steps closer to the phone base,
               curious, listening:
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                          "I just wanted to make sure Mom is
                          okay. Yesterday was... a bit
                          weird, and -- I'm just a little
                          worried."
          
               Karen, reluctant but realizing she should pick up, reaches
               for the phone...
          
               ...but the PHONE BASE is empty.   The cordless is missing.
          
               As Karen tries to figure out how to answer with the base:
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                          "Listen, just give me a call when
                          you can, okay?"
          
               CLICK.   Too late -- the caller hangs up.
          
               Silence returns to the room... but not completely.     Karen
               hears the soft sound of WHISPERING from nearby.
          
               Beyond her, we see a PALE FACE (KAYAKO) pressed against the
               frosted window of the sliding door of the TATAMI ROOM.
          
               The face pulls away from the glass just before Karen turns
               towards it. But the sound of WHISPERING continues.
          
               As she slowly walks to the door, we can make out some words:
          
                                    EMMA (O.S.)
                          ...I've told them over and over...
                          I've told them over and over...
          
               Karen listens for a moment, then slides the door open.
          
          23   INT. THE HOUSE - TATAMI ROOM - NIGHT                           23
          
               It's very dark in the room -- the lights have been turned
               off. Emma, sitting up in bed, turns towards Karen.
          
                                    KAREN
                          Emma, who were you talking to?
          
                                       Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        15.
          
          
          
               That's when Karen notices THE INDENTATION in the mattress,
               across from where Emma is sitting. Where someone else would
               be, if the old woman was having a conversation.
          
               Emma looks up at Karen with pleading eyes.
          
                                   EMMA
                         I just want her to leave me alone.
          
               Karen sits down next to her.
          
                                   KAREN
                         You should get some rest, Emma.
          
               She helps Emma lie back --
          
               -- but as the old woman's eyes move to the ceiling, they
               suddenly grow wide, her mouth opening in fear --
          
               -- Karen follows her gaze, looking up --
          
               -- and she SCREAMS, falling off the mattress, backing away --
          
               A MURKY BLACKNESS is lowering from the ceiling. Formless at
               first, but flowing and shifting... like a FIGURE draped with
               black silk. Drifting down until the shadowy "head" is only
               inches from Emma's terrified face.
          
               And then the "head" slowly turns, rotating towards Karen.
          
               In the midst of the blackness are TWO DISEMBODIED EYES.
               Filled with an intense rage. Focused directly on Karen.
          
               Off Karen's NERVE-SHATTERING SCREAM, we...
          
                                                              CUT TO BLACK.

               INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
               MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly,
               she doesn't. She's staring at the ceiling, listening to --
          
               -- SOUNDS coming in through the open bedroom door. Someone
               moving downstairs, fumbling around, bumping into things.
          
               Jennifer, frustrated, lets out a sigh.

               Matthew comes downstairs, dressed in a business suit.    He
               pauses to pick up some of the RUBBISH on the stairs.

               Jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot.
               She pours herself a mug, takes a big sip. Looks exhausted.
          
               Matthew enters, surprised to see her.
          
                                       MATTHEW
                          You're up?
          
                                       JENNIFER
                          Mmmmmm.
          
               Matthew glances into the back room through another sliding
               door -- the windows on this one are clear, not frosted like
               the living room.
          
               HIS POV:   Emma is asleep on her mattress.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          I wonder if Mom's okay. She's been
                          sleeping ever since we got here.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          Not at night.
          
               Matthew turns to her, surprised.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          I told you, Matthew, you can sleep
                          through anything.
          
               Matthew comes over, kisses her.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was
                          probably just the move -- I'm sure
                          she'll get back on schedule.
          
               Jennifer nods, not convinced.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          You seen my travel mug?

                          I didn't unpack it yet.
          
               Matthew kneels down next to a pair of MOVING BOXES in the
               corner -- `KITCHEN' written on the side. He explores it.

                    Who knows? Maybe there's something

                                 JENNIFER
                    Yeah.     Maybe.
          
          He finds his travel mug, wrapped in the sports section of an
          American newspaper. Matthew scans it as he fills his mug.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    I miss seeing this every morning.
          No response from his wife. He turns to see Jennifer looking
          down at Emma through the window.
          
          Matthew walks over, puts an arm around her.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Hey, kiddo. You okay?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I went for a walk yesterday. Just
                    to explore. I got lost and
                    couldn't find anyone who could
                    speak English, who could help me.
                    I felt so... stupid.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    This will get easier soon, for Mom,
                    for all of us. I promise.
          
          She turns to him.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Or else?
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Or else I'll tell the company it's
                    just not working out, and that
                    we're going back to the States with
                    or without my old job. They can
                    get someone else to crunch their
                    numbers.
          
          This makes Jennifer feel better.

                         give it a good try, okay Jen?

               The door opens and Matthew walks outside, stopping to look at
               a familiar BICYCLE, leaning against the house near the door.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Is this Yoko's bike?
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         I think so.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         It's been here all night.
          
               Matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate, leaning it
               against the wall (where we saw it earlier).
          
               He turns back to Jennifer, giving her a kiss.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         I'll probably be home late, maybe
                         around nine or so.
          
               Jennifer gives him a look.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         I knew you'd forget.
          
               Matthew pauses, looks back blankly.    Jennifer just smiles.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         Dinner, your sister?    At seven?
          
                                    MATTHEW
                         Oh yeah.   Right.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         You were going to cook.
                                   MATTHEW
                         I have a big conference.    They
                         usually run long.
          
               Jennifer rolls her eyes.

                         if you're going to be late.
          
               She goes back inside, closes the door.

               Jennifer stands by a cart, looking pale under the stark
               fluorescent lighting. She also looks shell-shocked.
          
               HER POV: before her is a WALL OF JAPANESE PRODUCTS. Barely
               a lick of English on any of the brightly-colored packages.
          
               Jennifer is, in a word, clueless. She looks around for
               assistance -- but she's lost in a whirl of Japanese faces.
          
               She tentatively reaches towards a bowl-shaped package.
               Studies the Japanese writing.
          
               Stealing a glance around her, she quietly tears open a corner
               of the bowl. Peeks inside. Sniffs it. She smiles.

               CLOSE ON the same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now
               open with a spoon sticking out of it. Resting, with a glass
               of water, atop the kotatsu table.
          
               PAN TO REVEAL a pair of feet on the lip of a MOVING BOX next
               to the table. It's Jennifer, asleep on the couch.
          
               A CLATTERING sound wakes her, followed by the sound of
               FOOTSTEPS running away. We PULL BACK as Jennifer sees her
               bowl, and the glass next to it, have been knocked over.
          
               She sits up, looking into the TATAMI ROOM. Emma sits on the
               edge of her mattress, staring blankly at her.
          
               Jennifer gets up, sternly walks over.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         If you need something, all you have
                         to do is say so --
          
               She stops short as she sees...
          
               FOOTPRINTS. Formed from the broth, and noodles, of her
               spilled soup. They're the footprints of a child.
          
               And they lead away from the back room, down the main hallway.

               Jennifer follows the DAMP FOOTPRINTS. They're getting
               lighter, and cease altogether in the foyer.
          
               She stands there for a moment, bewildered. Then she tenses,
               as if sensing she's being watched. She slowly turns to see --
          
               -- A BLACK CAT. Sitting on the first landing of the stairs.
               Staring at her with bright yellow eyes.
          
               As Jennifer takes a step towards it --
          
               TWO CHILD'S HANDS reach around the corner, and pick up the
               cat, pulling it out of view.
          
               Jennifer freezes.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          Who's -- who's there?
          
               No response. She walks up the stairs and looks around the
               corner. Nothing there.
          
               She takes a deep breath, and starts to climb.

               Reaching the top, Jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar
               BOY running into the FRONT ROOM.
          
               She slowly walks towards the open door -- we can't see inside
               the room from the hallway. But she pauses as she hears --
          
               THUD.   THUD.   The same rhythmic thumping that Karen heard.
          
               After a moment, Jennifer steps inside the room, disappearing
               from our sight.
          
               We hear her suddenly draw a GASP.
          
               A beat. As we DRIFT CLOSER to the doorway, we notice
               something strange: the room appears to be growing darker.
               A SHARP BREATHING can be heard from inside... quick, panicked
               gulps of air. Growing faster.
          
               Just as we reach the doorway, the harsh breathing stops.

          Then the door is SLAMMED SHUT from the inside.

               Matthew enters from work, jacket slung over his shoulder.

                            Sorry I'm late, it took awhile to
                            wrap things up.
          
               He leaves his briefcase by the door and turns to the hall --
          
               -- noticing the house is completely DARK.
          
                                       MATTHEW

               Matthew turns on the lights. The room has reverted to its
               messy state, even worse than before.
          
               He looks down at A PICTURE, formerly hanging on the wall, now
               lying on the ground. The glass is broken.
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            What the hell? --
          
               He quickly goes to the BACK ROOM. Emma sits on the edge of
               her bed, dazed and staring. In the darkness.
          
                                       MATTHEW
                            Mom?   Are you alright?
          
               No answer.    He kneels down next to her.
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            Where's Jennifer, Mom?
          
               Still nothing.      He surveys the mess in the room.   Angrily:
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            Did Yoko come today, Mom?
                            Remember? The pretty girl?
          
               He gets to his feet, looking at the SPILLED SOUP in the
               living room, now hardened and crusty.

               Matthew stands in the doorway of the dark room.   He tries the
               light switch. Nothing happens.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         Dammit.
          
               He slowly enters, feeling his way through the room. We can
               barely make him out in the darkness... we see the shape of
               THE BED by a window...
          
               Matthew feels his way to a table next to the bed.   Switches
               on a small lamp --
          
               -- JENNIFER IS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Lying in bed, staring wide-
               eyed at the ceiling. Matthew, startled, falls backwards.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         Jennifer?    What is it --
          
               Matthew rushes to her, shaking her. She's unresponsive. The
               only sign she's alive is that HER FEARFUL EYES slowly fix on
               him. Her mouth opens, as if she's trying to speak.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         What's wrong? What happened???
          
               She tries harder to form words, but can only produce a CROAK.

               Matthew runs into the kitchen grabbing A LARGE BOOK on one of
               the moving boxes. The Japanese equivalent of a YELLOW PAGES.
          
               He whips it open -- hardly a word of English in it.

               A stack of BOOKS sit on the very top of a tall bookshelf.
               Scissors and a roll of DUCT TAPE rest atop them.
          
               Matthew pushes everything aside to get at a JAPANESE/ENGLISH
               DICTIONARY underneath. The DUCT TAPE falls to the floor.
          
               He tears across the room to THE PHONE BASE -- but the
               cordless phone is missing.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Dammit!

               Matthew re-enters, out of breath. He sits next to Jennifer,
               who hasn't moved. Puts a hand on her chest to make sure
               she's still breathing. She is.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Jesus Christ...
          
               He looks through the dictionary, finding the word he needs:
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         `Ambulance'... "kyukyusha".
          
               Then he quickly rips open the Yellow Pages --
          
               -- seeing, in plain English, `EMERGENCY' on the first page.
               Below that: `FIRE/AMBULANCE -- DIAL 119'.
          
               He drops the book and reaches across the bed for a phone, on
               a table at the far side --
          
               -- THE BOY (TOSHIO) stands up, between Matthew and the phone.
          
               But he looks different from before: his skin is discolored,
               his lips and eyes are ringed and sullen.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Who are you? What -- what are you
                         doing here?
          
               Toshio makes a STRANGE SOUND. Looks at Jennifer, then turns
               to Matthew, SNARLING at him like a CAT.
          
               Matthew, shocked, falls backwards off the bed, hitting the
               table with the lamp. It drops to the ground --
          
                                          Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     24.
          
          
          
               -- and TOSHIO'S SHADOW, cast by the fallen light, begins to
               STRETCH AND GROW across the ceiling. The shadow creeps over
               Jennifer, shifting and coming towards Matthew --
          
               -- Matthew grabs the lamp.    He reaches it, holding it up --
          
               At first, it looks like both Jennifer and Toshio have
               disappeared. But then --
          
               -- Jennifer, suddenly back on the bed, SITS UPRIGHT, jerkily,
               as if she's been yanked up and forward. Her mouth is wide
               and gasping --
          
               -- and then she falls back onto the bed.     Dead.
          
               Matthew, stunned, backs away from the bed, against the
               closet. Terrified, he doesn't notice --
          
               -- the THUD THUD sound growing around him.     Then --
          
               -- TOSHIO'S HEAD comes into frame behind him. Matthew hears
               a GROWLING SOUND and turns, seeing Toshio right there! --

               The DOORBELL rings.   Then a few more times.
          
               SUSAN (American, late 20s) enters, with two bottles of wine.
          
                                     SUSAN
                         Hello?
          
               She kicks off her shoes.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         You guys in the kitchen?

               INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
               Susan walks in, puts the wine on the table.     Looks around.
          
                                   SUSAN
                             (calling out:)
                         I thought you guys were gonna cook!
          
               She goes into the BACK ROOM.    Sits next to Emma.
          
                                     SUSAN
                         Hi, Mom.    How are you feeling?
          
               Emma turns to her with her usual vacant look.

          There's a CREAK from above.   Susan looks up at the ceiling.

               Twisting a corkscrew into a wine bottle, Susan leans into the
               foyer, yelling upstairs:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         I'll give you guys one minute to
                         finish whatever you're doing up
                         there and get your butts down here.
          
               As she heads back towards the kitchen, we CRANE UP to see --
          
               MATTHEW. He's walking down the second floor hall. He looks
               different: the expression on his face is troubled, occupied.
          
               And he's dragging his dead wife's body.   By the hair.
          
               He pulls her inside the REAR ROOM -- the doorway looks more
               imposing, more ominous, than before. It's dark and
               malevolent, the threshold to a secret that won't stay buried.
          
               We CRANE BACK DOWN to see Susan in the kitchen.   She's poured
               a glass of wine and sighs impatiently.
          
               She walks back down the hall into the foyer.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         I mean it, guys.
          
               Silence from upstairs.   Shaking her head:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Well, I warned you. Prepare to be
                         emotionally scarred.
          
               She starts up the stairs and turns the first corner --
          
               -- MATTHEW is sitting there, hands on his knees, looking
               harried. Susan YELPS.
          
                                    SUSAN
                         Matthew!   Don't scare me like that!
          
               He's shaking slightly.   His eyes drift up to hers.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         What's going on?   Where's Jennifer?

                              MATTHEW
                    She went out. Something came up.
          
                              SUSAN
                    I hope she's not long.    I'm
                    absolutely starving.
          
          Matthew looks back down at his feet.      Susan misreads:
          
                              SUSAN
                    I knew it. You guys forgot to go
                    shopping, didn't you?
          
          Matthew abruptly stands.    Looming over his sister.
          
                                 MATTHEW
                    I'm sorry.     This is a bad time.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Are you okay? What's going on?
          
                              MATTHEW
                    You should go.
          
          He moves forward, right into her. His momentum pushes Susan
          back into the foyer. She holds onto his shirt:
          
                              SUSAN
                    Did something happen?    What's --
          
          Matthew's hands suddenly TIGHTEN ON HER SHOULDERS. His eyes
          grow wide, filled with anger, as he whispers fiercely --
          
                              MATTHEW
                    She doesn't love me... she never
                    loved me...
          
          Susan watches as he repeats himself, over and over.      Growing
          scared, she finally SHAKES HIM.
          
                              SUSAN
                    What are you talking about?
          
          Matthew slowly looks up.    Malice on his face.
          
          He steps forward.   Susan backs away.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Stop it, Matthew.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Leave me alone.

                             (yelling)
                         GO AWAY!!!
          
               Susan fumbles with the front door. She gets it open and runs
               out just before Matthew reaches her.
          
               ON MATTHEW: he stands there, head tilted down, for a moment.
               Then he straightens. Slowly closes the front door.
          
               Matthew heads back upstairs. He reaches the second floor and
               opens the door to the rear bedroom.
          
               The room beyond is dark. But A DARK FIGURE is visible,
               standing in the far corner, facing Matthew.
          
               He steps inside, and the door slowly swings shut behind him.

               EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
               It's an overcast afternoon.  Swollen clouds hang low over
               The House. It looks a bit more imposing than usual.
          
               THE MAILBOX is adorned with the Japanese equivalent of a "For
               Sale" sign -- weather-worn, and looks like it's been there
               for years.
          
               SUZUKI (30s, Japanese), a Real Estate agent, waits by the
               gate. Then he notices something. Waves, and smiles.
          
               It's SUSAN, approaching with MATTHEW, JENNIFER and EMMA.
          
               Susan shakes Suzuki's hand and they exchange a greeting in
               Japanese. She turns to her brother.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         This is Suzuki-san, he's the Real
                         Estate broker.
          
               Suzuki bows at Matthew and Jennifer, says something.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         What did he say?
          
                                   SUSAN
                         He said: "welcome to Tokyo". And
                         that you must be very important to
                         your company for them to rent this
                         place for you.

               Matthew grins.   Susan rolls her eyes.

               Everyone enters, checking the place out. Suzuki and Susan
               slip off their shoes. As Matthew steps into the foyer:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Your shoes.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         Oh.    Right.
          
               He kneels down, untying his shoes.   Jennifer looks perplexed.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         Even in our own house?
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Even in your own house.
          
               Suzuki smiles as Matthew and Jennifer take off their shoes.
               Susan says something to him in Japanese and he laughs. They
               walk down the hall, and Matthew and Jennifer follow.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
               Suzuki opens the blinds, letting some light into the place.
               It's not helping much -- it's still pretty dreary.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Isn't the layout great? Wait `till
                         you see the back room. It's
                         perfect for Mom -- she won't have

               Jennifer follows him through the room.   She doesn't look
               quite as enthusiastic.
          
               Matthew slides open the door leading to the TATAMI ROOM.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Her bed won't be here until next
                         week, but we can put the mattress
                         on the floor. What do you think?
          
               Jennifer warms a bit.   The wooden room is beautiful.
          
               Susan asks Suzuki a question in Japanese, and he responds.

                          Where's Mom?
          
                We slowly CRANE UP to the SECOND FLOOR HALL, moving towards
                the REAR ROOM at the end. The door is ajar.

                Susan comes up the stairs, worried.
          
                                     SUSAN
                          Mom?   Where are you?

                Susan looks inside -- Emma isn't there. She's about to leave
                when something catches her attention. She walks to
          
                THE CLOSET. The door is open. Susan kneels down, looking at
                something inside it. She picks it up --
          
                -- it's the CERAMIC CAT Karen found earlier. As Susan
                examines it, she notices something on the wall of the closet
                (which we don't see). Her face softens, and she smiles.

                Susan stands and walks out of the room. But we stay in the
                closet, PANNING TO REVEAL the closet wall. It's covered with
                BLACK CRAYON, low to the ground, the work of a child. The
                images are dozens of BLACK CATS.

               Emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom.
          
               Looking directly up at the ceiling.
          
               Susan enters, placing the ceramic cat on THE SHELF where
               Karen found it earlier. Except Susan faces it INTO THE ROOM.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         C'mon, Mom. You know what the
                         doctor said about stairs.
          
               She takes Emma's hand, but the old woman doesn't move.
          
               Matthew and Jennifer enter, worried.
          
                                     MATTHEW

               Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the

               He pauses by the open bathroom door.   Looks inside.

               Suzuki enters, looking at THE TUB:    filled to the brim.
          
               After a moment, Suzuki kneels down next to the bathtub.     He
               pulls the thin CHAIN connected to the rubber stopper --
          
               -- but the end of the chain comes out of the water.      Hmmm.
               It's not connected after all.
          
               Suzuki eyes the plug at the bottom of the tub.
          
               Then he takes off his jacket.   Rolls up his shirt sleeve.
          
               And reaches into the water for the rubber stopper.
          
               It's just out of reach.
          
               He rolls up his sleeve a little more.   Reaches deeper --
          
               -- suddenly there's a BURST OF SOUND: a dull THUMPING,
               something THRASHING in water, the SCREAMING of a YOUNG BOY,
               voice MUFFLED by water --
          
               -- Suzuki recoils as water SPLASHES UP around him --
          
               -- he falls away from the tub in horror, landing on his butt.
          
               THE BATHTUB: Filled to the brim.     Still and silent.    Not so
               much as a ripple on the surface.
          
               That couldn't have just been his imagination, could it?
          
               As he slowly stands, he sees something out of the corner of
               his eye --
          
               -- a DEAD CAT, bloody and torn, in the corner of the room.

                As Suzuki backs away from it, eyes widening in horror, he's
                startled by --
          
                MATTHEW, standing in the doorway.   Beaming at him.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          It's perfect. We'll take it.
          
                Suzuki looks back to the corner.    There's no dead cat.
          
                A RINGING SOUND comes into focus -- the BEEPING of a phone,
                waiting for someone to pick up and make the connection...

                It's after-hours in this office space: CUBICLES fill the
                center, surrounded by glass-windowed OFFICES. The glittering
                lights of the Tokyo cityscape beyond show a hell of a view.
          
                One light still burns in an office towards the end --
          
                -- SUSAN'S OFFICE. She's working late. She wears a phone
                headset while she types lines of code into her computer.
          
                No one's answering.   A familiar answering machine picks up:

                          you there? Pick up... Okay, well,

                She pauses.   Leans back, away from the keyboard.

                Susan walks through the hallway. She hears a strange
                scraping sound -- it sounds as though something is being
                dragged.
          
                Susan turns around, but the hallway looks normal. Is it just
                her imagination?
          
                The sound starts again, coming closer. Susan gets scared and
                opens the door to the emergency stairwell beside her.

                INT. STAIRWELL - 10TH FLOOR - NIGHT
                The hallway is chilly -- Susan shivers. She's about to start
                walking down when she looks up, noticing THE LIGHTS at the
                top floor FLICKERING.
          
                A wind suddenly blows through the center of the stairwell
                with an eerie ROAR.
          
                Susan looks disconcerted as she starts walking down...
          
                Then we hear the SCRAPING SOUND again. Startled, Susan
                pauses and looks down, over the railing.
          
                There's nothing there -- but the sound continues, growing
                louder, like something is moving up towards her.
          
                                    SUSAN
                              (calling out:)
                          Is anybody there?
          
                Just then, the lights on the top floor finally GO OUT.
          
                Susan's breath catches in her throat as she looks up --
          
                The lights on the next floor go out. And the next. The
                darkness above growing closer with each darkening floor.
          
                Susan nervously looks back down -- the SCRAPING is even
                closer. And then, for an instant, she sees A SKINNY PALE
                HAND on the railing two floors down.
          
                Terrified, Susan starts to back up -- but stops as she
                realizes that the darkness from above is almost upon her.

                slowly crawling up on the wall.
          
                Susan's mouth opens in a silent screen. With nowhere to
                escape, she opens the same door and rushes back into the

                 -- but her lucky RABBIT'S FOOT gets caught on the door latch.
                 Panicking, Susan struggles to free herself --
          
                 Through the crack, she sees the darkness continuing to come
                 down. The lights on Susan's floor FLICKER.
          
                 Susan looks up to see A PALE BOY on the landing to the higher
                 floor. The SAME BOY is also standing on the landing of each
                 floor above. They're all staring down at Susan.
          
                 Susan screams as she desperately tries to yank her chain
                 free... and then she sees THE PALE HAND clutching her
                 rabbit's foot!
          
                 The door shuts, and Susan falls backwards into the hallway.
          
                 She jumps to her feet and runs down the hall.

                 A cramped room. Susan stands in the doorway, animatedly
                 talking to a young SECURITY GUARD sitting at a desk lined
                 with VIDEO MONITORS. She's speaking rapidly, and shaking:
          
                                     SUSAN (IN JAPANESE)
                           In the stairs... there was...
                           something... a strange person...
                           all the lights were going out...
          
                 The Guard doesn't understand her -- in her panic, Susan's
                 MISPRONOUNCING HER WORDS, and she knows it.
          
                 Susan takes a breath, frustrated and frightened.
          
                                     SUSAN
                               (pleading, in English)
                           Please. Help me.
          
                 The Guard stands, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder.
          
                                     GUARD (IN JAPANESE)
                           I'll take a look. Wait here.
          
                 The Guard leaves.   Susan doesn't look thrilled to be alone.

                 Holding a flashlight, the Guard walks down the hallway,
                 checking the doors.

                Susan takes a breath and sits down, trying to relax. It's
                obvious that she feels safer, here in the Security Room.
          
                Then she notices movement on one of the SECURITY MONITORS --
          
                ON THE SCREEN: -- the GUARD continues down the 10TH FLOOR
                HALL, stopping at the door to the stairwell.
          
                Susan leans toward the monitor for a better view.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the Guard opens the stairwell door and leans
                inside, checking it out.
          
                ON SUSAN:   her eyes are glued to the screen.   Waiting.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the Guard, finding nothing out of the
                ordinary, closes the door and continues on down the hall.
          
                SUSAN leans back, exhaling.    Relieved.
          
                Then the video CRACKLES with a sudden quick burst of static.
          
                And Susan GASPS, sitting upright, as she sees --
          
                ON THE SCREEN:   the stairwell door OPENS AGAIN.   And then --
          
                -- something DARK moves out of the stairwell, entering the
                hallway.
          
                ON SUSAN: she recoils from the screen in horror, unable to
                tear her gaze away. Her mouth opens in a silent scream, her
                eyes widening as she watches --
          
                -- and then she finds the strength to get to her feet.

                Susan bursts out of the security room and runs through the

                She frantically hails a cab and gets in.

               A shifting wash of colors flood the taxi: the NEON LIGHTS of
               the surrounding buildings tower above, threatening to swallow
               her whole.

               Susan rushes through the front doors, clutching her purse
               strap with both hands. Shaken, just wanting to get home.
          
               She runs to the elevator and jabs the button for her floor.

               Susan tries to regain her composure as the elevator rises.
               She closes her eyes and leans against the wall --
          
               -- not noticing A FAMILIAR PALE JAPANESE BOY looking at her
               through the window of every floor she passes --
          
               Toshio. He's standing CLOSER TO THE WINDOW with each floor.
               Until finally, he's RIGHT NEXT TO THE GLASS --
          
               The elevator stops at her floor:    no little boy this time.

               Susan gets out of the elevator, moving quickly to her
               apartment at the end of the hall.
          
               She chances a look over her shoulder as she puts the key in
               her lock. Then she goes in and closes the door.

               Susan enters. She takes a long, deep breath. Safe at home.
               She sits at her kitchen table, laying her purse down.
          
               Her eyes go to the BROKEN CHAIN still hanging from the strap,
               with some rabbit's foot fur lodged in the links.
          
               Susan's home phone RINGS, and she jumps.    She stares at it
               for a moment, then tentatively answers:

               She presses a button on the phone, and is about to hang up --
          
               Almost immediately there's a LOUD KNOCK at her door. She
               gets to her feet, surprised. How did he get up so fast?
          
               Susan goes to the door and looks through the peephole.
          
               HER POV: Matthew's face, distorted by the fish-eye glass.
               He's looking into the peephole, with a sneer on his face.
          
               Susan opens the door.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         I don't know what you're up to, but
                         this is not cool --
          
               She catches her breath.   THERE'S NO ONE THERE.
          
               Then the phone emits the THROATY CROAKING sound.   Quickly
               growing louder and LOUDER...
          
               Susan cries out and drops the phone. It BREAKS OPEN on the
               hallway floor as Susan slams her apartment door.

               courage to step forward, and look through the peephole --
          
               HER POV: the phone lies broken in the middle of the floor.
               Otherwise, the hallway is empty.
          
               Susan backs away from the door, shaking in fright.
          
               Breathing hard, she backs into --

                Susan enters, turning off her cell phone and unplugging the
                bedroom phone from the wall.
          
                Then she retreats to the safety of her bed, eyes on --
          
                THE APARTMENT DOOR, next to the kitchen.    Silence.
          
                Susan's breathing slows. But she looks around the room,
                still anxious -- it's too quiet in here. Her panic builds.
                But she's alone in the room, isn't she?
          
                As we MOVE IN on Susan, the room starts to become quieter.
                The SOUND OF TRAFFIC from outside, the HUMMING REFRIGERATOR
                in the kitchen... everything fades to a stifling silence.
          
                And Susan notices, all right.    Her breath, now suddenly loud,
                catches in her throat.
          
                A long moment of silence.   Then --
          
                -- DRIP.   DRIP.
          
                It's coming from the KITCHEN SINK.
          
                Susan stares at it.   She finally stands, and --

                -- slowly walks into THE KITCHEN. She reaches out and turns
                the faucet handle. Tightens it. The dripping stops.
          
                Relieved, Susan turns away --
          
                -- DRIP.   DRIP.   It begins again.   Louder, more intense.
          
                Scared, Susan turns back to the sink. Water is now GUSHING
                OUT from the faucet, filling up a bowl in the sink.
          
                She slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet, as
                tightly as she can manage --
          
                -- tighter... tighter... straining with the effort..
          
                Until the water stops.   Only then does she let go --
          
                -- just then, a CHILD'S PALE HAND quietly rises to the
                surface from water in the bowl, and starts VIOLENTLY
                SPLASHING the surface.

                She lies down, shivering, pulling the quilt to her chin.      A
                final retreat.
          
                                    SUSAN
                          Please... stop it...
          
                The SPLASHING SOUNDS in the kitchen continue for a while.
                Then, it suddenly stops.
          
                Susan is so terrified that she almost faints.
          
                Then her breathing stops.   Her eyes widen.
          
                Her hand reaches up under her pillow, feeling around --
          
                -- and she comes out with HER LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT.
          
                The one she left behind in the stairwell.
          
                Susan suddenly CRIES OUT, her head tilting back, her body
                abruptly going stiff. We soon see why:
          
                A LUMP begins to rise at the foot of the bed. A big one.
                Moving slowly up Susan's body. Reaching the edge of the
                quilt, which slowly rises --
          
                -- revealing a QUICK FLASH of the PALE FACE OF THE JAPANESE
                WOMAN WITH LONG DARK HAIR on top of her!
          
                Susan SCREAMS, and is abruptly pulled under the covers --
          
                                                              CUT TO BLACK.

               Dark and still.   Lying in wait.   Completely silent, except --
          
               -- someone's KNOCKING on the front door.

               The knocking has stopped.    Silence.
          
               Then Karen's cell phone suddenly LIGHTS UP, ringing.
          
               It rings four times, then goes to voice mail.

               A new SOUND breaks the silence: movement outside. Crunching
               footsteps on gravel, someone brushing past tree limbs.
          
               A SHADOW falls over the window.   A face looks inside --
          
               -- it's ALEX, Karen's boss. He walks away from the window
               and continues down the side of the house --
          
               -- we TRACK down the hallway, past the bathroom, through the
               kitchen, following his progress into --
          
               THE BACK ROOM: Alex is visible through the sliding door
               leading to the back porch. He peers inside.
          
               HIS POV: A FIGURE covered head-to-toe in a white sheet lies
               on the mattress. Unmoving.
          
               Alex tries the sliding door -- it's open.     He steps inside.
          
                                     ALEX
                         Karen?
          
               Silence greets him.   He stares down at the figure in the bed.
          
               Alex licks his lips, nervous.   Finally walks to the mattress,
               kneeling down next to it.
          
               Raises a hand and grabs the sheet.      Raises it over the head --
          
               -- it's Emma. As we last saw her, eyes on the ceiling, mouth
               and eyes wide open in fear.
          
               But now it's clear, from the tache noire in the eyes, the
               blanched skin, the rigidity of her body: she's dead.
          
               Alex falls back onto his butt, staring at Emma.     He pulls
               himself away from the corpse --
          
               -- and freezes.    There's something right behind him.
               He whirls around --
          
               -- it's KAREN.    In the corner, looking pale and dazed.

               Two POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are parked out front.
          
               An UNMARKED CAR pulls up, and DETECTIVE NAKAGAWA (40s) exits
               the passenger side. He looks up at The House with dread.
          
               The driver, DETECTIVE IGARASHI (30s), moves next to him.
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         I can handle this myself, you know.
                         It's just a routine call. I don't
                         know why you wanted to come.
          
               He turns to Nakagawa, awaiting a response. He doesn't get
               one. Nakagawa just stares up at The House.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LATER
               The house feels completely different: all the interior
               lights are on, a few POLICE OFFICERS mill about, two EMTs
               wheel EMMA'S BODY out the front door on a gurney.
          
               Alex sits at the kitchen table, frazzled.   He turns to --
          
               -- KAREN. She's sitting in the living room, wrapped in a
               blanket, being attended to by a FEMALE NURSE and speaking
               with Nakagawa and Igarashi, who is taking notes on a pad.
          
               Karen says something and the Detective looks over at Alex.
               Then he speaks to the Nurse, who helps Karen to her feet.
          
               Nakagawa and Igarashi enter the kitchen.    In perfect English:
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                         I am Detective Nakagawa. This is
                         Detective Igarashi, my assistant.
          
                                   ALEX
                         Is Karen okay?

                    She is very shaken. We would like
                    her to stay in the hospital
                    tonight, under evaluation.
          
          He hands Alex a wedding picture of MATTHEW AND JENNIFER.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    Do you know these people?
          
                              ALEX
                    Matthew Williams, and his wife
                    Jennifer. He's Emma's son, the
                    woman Karen came here to see.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    When was the last time you saw him?
          
                              ALEX
                    I met them when they came to
                    register. It's standard procedure,
                    though the visits were arranged by
                    his employer. He works at --
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    We've spoken with his employer.   He
                    did not show up for work today.
          
          Something about this gives Alex pause. Nakagawa speaks
          briefly to Igarashi in Japanese, then hands Alex a card.
          
                              NAKAGAWA

               He turns to look up at A WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
          
               It's empty.

               Igarashi stands by the ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message
               counter reads `1'. He presses PLAY.
          
               SUSAN'S MESSAGE replays, and he listens carefully. As it
               ends, he turns to see NAKAGAWA standing in the doorway.
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         That's Matthew's sister.
          
               He shows Nakagawa a PHOTO of Matthew and Susan, brother and
               sister, grinning at the camera.

               Nakagawa reaches down, pressing the `LOCATE' button.
          
               A distant BEEPING SOUND can be heard.

               They pause in the hallway for a moment. Then Nakagawa walks
               into the rear room (Matthew's office). The BEEPING is close.
          
               He stands there, in the center of the room, listening.
          
               Then he looks up, at the ceiling.    Everyone follows suit.
          
               Nakagawa turns to the CLOSED CLOSET DOORS.

               He quickly pulls open the door.   The closet is empty.
          
               Nakagawa looks up, peering into the darkness.
          
               HIS POV:   the ATTIC PANEL yawns wide open.
          
               And right next to it are FOUR LONG GROOVES in the ceiling.
               As if something was dragged across it, right to the edge.
          
               Something like fingernails.
          
               Nakagawa leans out, looking at Igarashi.
          
                                    NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)

               A shaft of light from the flashlight through the open attic
               access cuts through the thick darkness.
          
               Nakagawa appears, pulling himself up into the attic.     He
               swings his flashlight slowly around the room.
          
               Igarashi comes up next to Nakagawa just as the Detective's
               flashlight stops on something.
          
               A beat as they exchange an uneasy look.
          
               Then Nakagawa and Igarashi crawl through the darkness towards
               the far corner of the space.
          
               Two bodies are tucked into the corner.    MATTHEW AND JENNIFER.

               Nakagawa sits in front of the bodies, examining them.
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         What the hell... what is going on?
          
               Nakagawa sees the beeping CORDLESS PHONE a few feet away.
          
               SOMETHING next to it attracts Nakagawa's interest. We can't
               see what it is, but there's some DEEP RED in it, and
               something very WHITE --
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         What is that?
          
               -- Nakagawa's eyes widen as he realizes what he's looking at.

               EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
               The POLICE CARS outside have attracted a small crowd.   The
               TWO BODIES are being loaded into a POLICE VAN.
          
               Nakagawa stands with THE CORONER. The CORONER'S ASSISTANT,
               wearing a face mask and rubber gloves, approaches. He holds
               something small, wrapped in a bloody white sheet.
          
               The Coroner slowly unfolds the sheet. We can't see what he's
               looking at -- but it elicits quite a reaction.
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                         Who does this belong to?
          
                                   NAKAGAWA   (IN JAPANESE)
                         We don't know.
          
               The Coroner quickly re-covers the object.
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                         I can use the blood to help
                         identify the person.
          
               As the Coroner and his assistant walk away:
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Is it possible that someone could
                         live without... that?
          
               The Coroner turns back, his face pale.

                Nakagawa turns away to see Igarashi approaching, talking into
                a cell phone. He looks disturbed. As he hangs up:
          
                                    IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                          Someone just reported another
                          death. It's not in our district...
                          but I think we should check it out.
          
                Nakagawa realizes something's troubling his partner.
          
                                       NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                          Why?

                          The cause of death is not clear...
                          but it is the man who sold them
                          this house.

                EXT. TOKYO STREET - DAY
                CLOSE ON the spinning wheels of a bicycle.      A familiar one.
          
                The pedals are being pumped by a beautiful young Japanese
                woman -- this is YOKO (early 20s).
          
                Yoko turns, riding down a small side street.      It ends, and
                she rounds a corner stopping in front of --
          
          
          77a   EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY                                         77a
          
                Yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door,
                leaning it against the wall nearby (exactly where we saw
                Matthew bump into it earlier).
          
                She rings the door buzzer. Waits. She seems to have
                expected this: she pulls a KEY from her pocket, with a
                plastic LABEL on it.

                Yoko steps inside. She instinctively slips off her shoes.
                She calls out, in decent English:
          
                                    YOKO
                          Hi, excuse me?
          
                There's a small ENVELOPE with YOKO'S NAME resting on a small
                table by the door. She takes it, opens it.

          THE LETTER says, simply:   "Out for a walk, back later."

                                    YOKO
                         Emma?   It's Yoko.   I'm coming in.
          
          
          79   INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                           79
          
               The house is the least "moved-into" that we've seen so far:
               although the main furniture is in place, MOVING BOXES are
               stacked in every room, in various stages of unpacking.
          
               But there's also an unusual amount of mess in the house -- a
               disarray, much like the opening sequence, that isn't exactly
               related to moving in.
          
               Yoko surveys the room, dismayed by the mess.
          
               Then she sees EMMA at the far end of the living room, her
               back to Yoko. She's looking down at something in her hands.
          
                                     YOKO
                         Hi, Emma.    It's good to see you
                         again.
          
               Emma turns. Looks blankly at Yoko, who approaches.
               Realizing the woman doesn't remember her:
          
                                   YOKO
                         My name is Yoko.
          
               The old woman still gives no sign of recognition.   Yoko
               gently takes her arm.
          
                                   YOKO
                         You should be in bed --
          
               Then she sees what Emma was looking at: the roll of DUCT
               TAPE. She's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade.
          
                                   YOKO (IN JAPANESE)
                         You shouldn't be playing with this!
          
               Shaking her head, Yoko takes the duct tape and looks around
               for a place where Emma can't get at it --
          
               -- she puts the tape ON THE STACK OF BOOKS at the top of the
               bookshelf, next to the scissors (where Matthew found them).

                From the entrance, we see Yoko come out of the kitchen
                holding a tray with a teapot and cup.
          
                She walks into the BACK ROOM, looking down at Emma's bed.
                The old woman must be asleep: Yoko gently lays down the
                tray, quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut.
          
                Then Yoko moves through the LIVING ROOM to the PHONE BASE --
          
                -- she picks up THE CORDLESS, finally where it belongs.
          
                Yoko dials a number as she walks into THE ENTRANCE HALL.     She
                begins a conversation (in Japanese) as she looks at the
                scattered rubbish on the ground, shaking her head.
          
                She climbs up to the SECOND FLOOR, pausing to kneel and pick
                up some pieces of crumpled paper, chatting all the while.
          
                THUD. THUD. Yoko pauses, turning towards the open door to
                the front room. The rhythmic THUMPING continues.

                The room is a mess. The bed is unmade, clothes are strewn on
                the floor. Looks like a storm swept through it.
          
                Yoko stands in the doorway, listening for the THUMPING
                sounds. But they've stopped.
          
                She finishes her call and hangs up. Sighs. She sticks the
                cordless phone into her pocket and starts to clean the room.
          
                As Yoko straightens the bedspread, she hears something.
                Pauses. And we hear it too --
          
                -- a familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND.   Quiet and muffled.

                 Yoko, a bit unnerved by the strange sound, pulls a small MP3
                 player and headphones from her pocket. She puts them on, and
                 goes back to work.

                 Yoko backs into the hallway, humming along to the music.
                 Preoccupied, she doesn't notice as --
          
                 The DOOR TO THE REAR ROOM, at the end of the dark hall behind
                 her, SLOWLY SWINGS OPEN.
          
                 Yoko turns and walks down the hall towards it.

                 Yoko enters the room, which is also a mess. The MOVING BOXES
                 are tumbled about the small room. She sighs.
          
                 Then she notices the CERAMIC CAT on the shelf, FACING HER
                 (where Susan left it).   Apparently she's not a big fan of
                 felines: she uneasily turns it to FACE THE WALL instead.
          
                 Yoko turns back to the room, staring to stack the moving
                 boxes (the way we saw them before). As she does --
          
                 -- she pauses again. The music in her headphones starts
                 PHASING, digital noise creeping in...
          
                 Yoko takes off the headphones.   Stares at them.
          
                 And then there's another CROAKING SOUND.   From close by.
          
                 Yoko draws a breath, quickly looking up --
          
                 -- AT THE CEILING, directly above her.   That's where the
                 horrible sound is coming from.
          
                 Freaked out, Yoko backs away, and opens the bedroom door --

                 sunlight, are now completely opaque.
          
                 Yoko stands in the doorway, scared, afraid to step into the
                 darkness. Then she looks down --

               Yoko stumbles back into the room.   Her eyes fixed on --
          
               -- THE DOORWAY: the creeping darkness is now coming in
               around all sides, not just the bottom.
          
               Yoko backs up to the bed, still clutching the CORDLESS PHONE.
          
               She looks back at the door, suddenly CRYING OUT --

               itself, sitting perfectly still, like a statue. Staring at
               Yoko with its yellow eyes. Something unnatural about it.
          
               Yoko backs away towards the closet.   Nowhere to go.
          
               The cat suddenly HISSES AT HER --
          
               -- and that's all Yoko can take.    In a panic, she opens the

               Yoko slams the door shut, pulling herself up onto a raised
               shelf. Breathing hard, looking down at --
          
               -- the crack under the door.   The light is beginning to dim.
          
               Yoko presses back into the closet, trapped.
          
               The closet is starting to get dark.   Quickly.
          
               Yoko looks around desperately.   Looking up, she sees --
          
               -- THE ATTIC PANEL above her is wide open.
          
               Caught between a rock and a hard place.   Yoko decides:
          
               She shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull
               herself into the attic.

               INT. ATTIC - DAY
               Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders.     She looks around,
               but can't see a thing in the darkness.
          
               She's about to pull herself all the way up --
          
               -- when she hears the THROATY CROAKING SOUND.
          
               Coming from the darkness.
          
               Yoko stiffens, her breath catching in her throat.
          
               ANOTHER POV: we're at the far end of the attic, suddenly and
               rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO...
          
               ON YOKO:   something brushes her face.   Long, black hair.
          
               There's a head, just inches from hers.    Almost nose-to-nose.

               Yoko is paralyzed with fear, eyes wide.   A long beat.
          
               Then she reaches into her pocket, pulling out a LIGHTER.
          
               Yoko raises it and flicks the wheel --
          
               -- we get a glimpse of a PALE FACE, surrounded by long black
               hair, eyes wide and mouth open, the THROATY SOUND suddenly
               increasing in pitch and volume --
          
               -- as the face moves forward --
          
                                                             CUT TO BLACK.

               Karen slowly wakes up in bed.    As her eyes clear, she sees --
          
               DOUG. He sits on the edge of the bed, slightly slumped, his
               back to her.
          
               He slowly turns -- and a relieved smile crosses his face.     He
               moves closer, and reaches out a hand.
          
                                      DOUG
                         It's okay.     I've got you.
          
               Karen nods, lacing her fingers in his. But her eyes are
               glazed and unfocused -- she's exhausted.
          
                                    DOUG
                         Your boss told me what happened.
                         I'm sorry.
          
               She turns away, the memory bothering her.    Doug takes her
               hand, massaging her fingers, worried.
          
                                   DOUG
                         I talked to your teachers. They
                         said you can take as much time as
                         you need. We could go to Kyoto for
                         a weekend, see those temples you're
                         always talking about.
          
               Karen tries to smile back, but her heart's not in it.

                    I'm not even sure what did happen.
          
                              DOUG
                    You went to help someone who was,
                    quite simply, beyond help.
          
                              KAREN
                    No, that's not what I mean...
          
          She trails off, trying to remember.   Doug waits.
          
                              KAREN
                    That house. There was something...
          
          Doug sees her frustration, and tenderly brushes a hair from
          her face.
          
                              DOUG
                    Don't beat yourself up searching
                    for a greater truth, Kat. An old
                    woman passed away in her sleep.
                    It's sad, but that's all it is --
          
                              KAREN
                    Is that how they said she died?
          
                              DOUG
                    I'm sorry this happened to you.
                    But maybe, in a way, it will help
                    you later. Death is an unfortunate
                    but integral part of your future
                    career. There's no avoiding it.
                    Maybe now you'll be more... ready
                    for it.
          
                              KAREN
                    I don't think I'll ever be ready
                    for something like that.
          
          She turns away. Doug wraps an arm around her.   Karen leans
          into him, and he strokes her hair.

          The moment is broken by a soft KNOCK. Detective Nakagawa
          stands in the doorway, holding a thick FILE.
          
                               NAKAGAWA
                    I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss
                    Davies. I was wondering if you
                    could answer some additional
                    questions?
          
          Doug stands, intercepting Nakagawa.   He sticks out a hand.
          
                                DOUG
                    I'm Doug.    Karen's boyfriend.
          
          Nakagawa nods. Fixes Doug with a blank stare.   Taking the
          hint, Doug turns to Karen.
          
                              DOUG
                    You up for this?
          
                              KAREN
                        (nodding:)
                    Why don't you find out when I can
                    check out of here.

          Reluctantly, Doug kisses her brow, then exits. Nakagawa
          pulls a chair up to the bed and sits, putting the file on a
          small table.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    How are you feeling?
          
                               KAREN
                    Okay.   Tired.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    You are an exchange student?
                        (Karen nods:)
                    And you have been volunteering at
                    the Health Center for...?
          
                              KAREN
                    Three months. I needed a social
                    welfare credit.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    You said this was the first time
                    you'd been in that house?
          
                               KAREN
                    Yes.
          
          She notices Nakagawa isn't taking notes. He seems somewhat
          uncomfortable, as if he's building to something:
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    About the Japanese boy you said you
                    saw there --
          
                              KAREN
                    Did you find him?
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    No, not yet. You said the boy had
                    been taped into the closet?
          
                              KAREN
                    Yes, that's right. He was...
                    holding a cat. A black cat.
                        (remembering:)
                    There was a book in the closet,
                    too. I think it was a journal.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    Did it belong to the boy?

          Nakagawa looks up.   Karen tries to explain:
          
                              KAREN
                    The writing. It looked feminine.

                    I left it on the kitchen table.
          
          Nakagawa frowns, scribbles a note.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    I didn't see any book on the table.
                    Perhaps someone moved it. Did you
                    speak with the boy after you opened
                    the closet?
          
          She thinks, recalling:
          
                              KAREN
                    I asked him his name.   He said
                    `Toshio'.
          
          Nakagawa immediately tenses. A long beat. He can see how
          exhausted Karen is. But something's troubling him:
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    One more question, please.
          
          He slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out THE PHOTO
          Karen found, and taped together. He shows it to her.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    We found this in the room where...
          
          Karen looks at the picture.
          
                              KAREN
                    This is him. This is the boy.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    Are you certain?
          
                               KAREN
                    Yes.   Positive.
          
          Nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands.
          
          And Karen notices -- Nakagawa's hands are shaking.

                    Detective Nakagawa?
          
          He looks up at her, a faraway look in his eyes.
          
                              KAREN
                    The whole time I was in that house,
                    I felt something was... wrong.

          From the expression on Nakagawa's face, she's onto something.
          
                              KAREN
                    What happened there?
          
          Nakagawa holds Karen's gaze for a moment. Even in her
          exhausted state, it's clear -- she's as frightened as he is.

                         The bodies of the son and daughter-
                         in-law of the woman you were caring
                         for were found in the attic.
          
               Karen just stares at him, stunned.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                         It seems that the son killed his
                         wife, and then himself --
          
               There's a KNOCK on the door. Igarashi stands in the doorway.
               He speaks to Nakagawa in Japanese.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                             (to Karen)
                         Please excuse me for a moment.
          
               Nakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and
               closes the door, but not all the way. Karen watches and
               listens through the crack:

                         We checked the apartment of Susan,
                         the sister. She wasn't there...
          
               He trails off, hesitating.
          
                                     NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Yes?
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         The chain lock had been drawn from
                         the inside. And the deadbolt. But
                         we found no one in the apartment.
          
               Nakagawa takes this in.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Get the surveillance tapes from the
                         office building.
          
               Igarashi nods.    But doesn't move.   After a moment, quietly:
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         They were the first family to live
                         in that house since the incident
                         three years ago --
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        56.
          
          
          
               Nakagawa's harsh look silences him. Then the Detective
               turns, noticing KAREN watching them. He pulls the door shut.

               Nakagawa's stern voice is muffled by the closed door.    Karen
               sits back in bed, disturbed.
          
               Then her attention turns to THE FILE on the table.
          
               She considers.   Then reaches for it.   Opens it.
          
               It's a POLICE REPORT, in Japanese.
          
               Karen scans it, and turns the page.     She draws a breath --
          
               -- it's a photo of THE HOUSE. Cordoned off with police tape.
               An ambulance out front. Like the scene she just left...
          
               ...only the picture is dated three years ago.
          
               THREE DETECTIVES are visible beyond the open front door,
               conferring in the entryway.
          
               The photo of the house is attached to a POLICE REPORT, with
               THREE PICTURES. A stern-looking Japanese man (TAKEO), a
               somber woman (KAYAKO), and a YOUNG BOY we know very well --
          
               Karen makes the connection. She picks up the taped-up photo
               and compares it to the file... the boy and his father are the
               same as in the newspaper.
          
               Karen gently touches the "missing" face of KAYAKO -- then her
               eyes move to the picture of THE BOY.
          
               Her eyes widen as she reads THE JAPANESE TEXT under his face:
          
                                     KAREN

               INT. NURSING CARE CENTER - NIGHT
               The place is quiet, completely deserted.    Except for --
          
               -- Alex. He's behind his desk in the reception area, staring
               off into space. Alex finally glances up at a clock -- it's
               almost ten o'clock.
          
               He gets up, turns off his computer, switches off the lights,
               and walks around the reception desk towards --
          
                                    Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     57.
          
          
          
          THE FRONT DOORS. He hits a final light switch and is almost
          to the exit, when --
          
          -- he suddenly SLIPS. Almost falls.    Saves himself by
          throwing a hand up against the wall.
          
          He looks down.    What the hell did he slip on?
          
          A pool of liquid. Right by the front doors, where the ladder
          stood earlier. It's too dark to make out what the fluid is.
          
          Alex looks down at HIS HAND -- it's covered in the liquid.
          And there's a dark HANDPRINT where he grabbed the wall.
          
          HIS POV: a trail of FOOTPRINTS lead from the pool of liquid,
          around the base of the stairs.
          
          His eyes on his dirtied hand, Alex slowly reaches for the
          nearby light switch. The overheads come on --
          
          -- the liquid is deep red.   Blood.
          
          Alex looks across the room. Shaking, he starts to walk
          forward, following the footsteps.
          
          He pauses at the bottom of the stairs, seeing --
          
          -- the BLOOD TRAIL has stopped.   Right by the bottom step.
          
          Alex looks up the staircase.   No blood.
          
          After a moment, Alex starts to walk up.    As he reaches the
          first landing --
          
          He freezes.   Sensing something behind him.   He turns to see --
          
          YOKO. Head lowered, clothing is torn and bloody. She's
          slowly climbing up the steps, but she's MOVING JERKILY, like
          a marionette, her limbs making a strange CREAKING as if
          tendons and muscles are being pushed to their limits.
          
          And there's BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN, splattering on her shoes.
          
                                ALEX
                    Yoko?
          
          She keeps moving, straining, climbing... towards him.

                                    ALEX
                          What... What happened, Yoko?
          
               Now she finally stops, two steps away.    A long beat.
          
                                    ALEX
                          Say something, please...
          
               Yoko slowly raises her head towards him --
          
               -- the lower half of her face is missing. Her jawbone has
               been ripped out, her tongue hanging limply on her chest.
          
               Alex stumbles backwards... and his foot lands right in a
               puddle of blood. His legs fly out from under him and he
               CRACKS HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND.
          
               HIS POV: everything goes blurry, and canted 90 degrees.       But
               it looks like there's A FIGURE standing in the hallway,
               watching the scene...
          
               ...a small boy holding a black cat...
          
               Dazed, Alex plants a hand on the ground and pulls himself
               into a seating position --
          
               -- and coming face-to-face with YOKO, kneeling down directly
               in front of him. Her bloody tongue dripping, lolling...
          
               ON ALEX:   eyes wide, he opens his mouth to scream --
          
                                                              HARD CUT TO:

               Nakagawa sits at the desk. Exhausted, dark circles under his
               eyes, he's staring down at --
          
               THE FILE on his desk.   As if he's afraid to even open it.
          
               But he does. He flips through the photos, pausing on that of
               TOSHIO, but continuing on to THE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of The
               House from three years ago (the one Karen saw), with the
               THREE DETECTIVES.
          
               Nakagawa turns to a FRAMED PICTURE on his desk -- it's
               YOUNGER NAKAGAWA at a bar with THREE FAMILIAR DETECTIVES.
               They're off-duty, grinning at the camera. Buddies.
          
               The two photographs share THE SAME THREE DETECTIVES.

               As Nakagawa looks at the crime scene photo, he realizes
               something. He slowly stands, in shock, trembling.
          
               The phone RINGS, startling him.
          
               Nakagawa walks over, picks up the phone.
          
                                      NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Hello?
          
               He listens.
          
               His face goes blank.    He slowly lowers the phone.

               The CORONER sits on a stool, staring at the floor. TWO
               BODIES lie under bloody white sheets on two STEEL TABLES.
               Between them is a small cart -- a bloody cloth on top.
          
               Nakagawa and Igarashi enter. The Coroner stands, nervous.
               He walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Have you determined a cause of
                         death?
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                         Not yet. The blood on his body --
                         isn't his. It belongs to her.
          
               He points to the other table.    But doesn't look at it.

                       I don't understand. He killed
                       Yoko, before he died?
          
          The Coroner shakes his head. Nakagawa looks to Igarashi,
          then walks up to the second body, pulling back the sheet.
          
          IT'S YOKO.    Still missing her jawbone.
          
          Nakagawa and Igarashi stare down at her in disbelief.
          
          The Coroner walks to the small table, removing the cloth.
          Yoko's JAWBONE is underneath it.
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       The jawbone you found in the attic
                       yesterday with the American couple
                       belongs to this girl. I estimate
                       it was -- removed -- from her body
                       two or three days ago.
          
                                 IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                       But I thought you said her body was
                       found with this man, tonight.
          The Coroner nods.    Eyes on his shoes.
          
                                 NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                       Then how did she get from the house
                       to the Health Center?                                
          
          The Coroner, lost in his imagination, answers quietly:
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       I have no idea.
          
          A beat.   Nakagawa walks to the jawbone.   Stares at it.
          
                                 NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                       She survived for two days without
                       this?
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       It would seem so.

                       How is that possible?
          
          The Coroner looks up at him, his face pale.

                 Doug sits on the bed, next to a DRESSING CURTAIN. Karen's
                 silhouette is visible behind it, pulling on her clothes.
          
                 He watches the curtain for a beat, concerned.     Then:

                           I got us a guidebook to Kyoto. I

                           I didn't want to --
          
                 Karen turns away, picking up her backpack and slinging it.
                 She walks past him, disappointed, and leaves the room.
          
                                     DOUG
                           Karen -- wait --
          
                 He quickly grabs his coat and bag.

                 INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
                 Karen paces down the hall towards a RECEPTION AREA.       Doug
                 catches up with her, turning her towards him.
          
                                     DOUG
                           Look, I'm sorry. I was just
                           worried about you, and -- I know
                           you, Karen.
          
                 Karen turns to him.   A sober look on her face.

                    The same thing happened three years
                    ago, Doug. To a Japanese family,
                    who lived in that house. They were
                    all found dead.
          
          Doug studies her for a moment.
          
                               DOUG
                    So you think the events are
                    connected?
          
                              KAREN
                    How would you explain it?
          
          She watches Doug as he thinks.   Carefully.
          
                              DOUG
                    Okay. How about this: the
                    American family knew about what had
                    happened there before, and this
                    knowledge subconsciously caused
                    them to repeat the same events.
          
          Karen gives Doug a skeptical look.
          
                              DOUG
                    It's exactly how superstitions
                    survive: if you walk under a
                    ladder and think uh-oh, you're in
                    for some bad luck, sure enough,
                    what do you know? You trip over --
          
                              KAREN
                        (heard it before:)
                    -- trip over the curb and sprain
                    your ankle.
          
                              DOUG
                    Makes sense, right?
          
          Karen stops walking.   Considering something.

                              KAREN
                    Okay. Then explain this: when I
                    went to that house, I didn't know
                    anything about its past. But yet I
                    still saw...
          
          She hesitates, realizing she's said too much.
          
                                DOUG
                    Saw what?    Karen?
          
                              KAREN
                    Emma and I were alone in that room,
                    but -- there was something else
                    there. I'm sure of it.
          
                              DOUG
                    You watched a woman die, Kat.
                    That's a horrible thing to
                    experience. I can't imagine how
                    you must feel. But sometimes the
                    mind tries to cope with terrible
                    things in a way that distorts what
                    actually occurred.
          
          Karen's eyes never leave his.   Softly, but firmly:
          
                              KAREN
                    You might be right, Doug. But I
                    know what I saw.
                        (then, faltering:)
                    I think I know what I saw...
          
          After a moment, Doug pulls her into a hug.
          
                              DOUG
                    You just need to rest. We'll get
                    you home, get a good night's sleep.
          
                                KAREN
                    Yeah.
          
          But her eyes speak differently. She covers it well, stepping
          back and glancing over at the reception desk:
          
                              KAREN
                    You've got class, and I'm sure I
                    only have to fill out a few forms
                    or something --
          
                                DOUG
                    You sure?

          He kisses her, then exits. He pauses at the front doors to
          give her a little wave. She smiles... but the smile droops
          as soon as he's out of sight.
          
          After a moment, she turns and walks to the front desk.

                Karen sits at her computer desk.   She looks exhausted.
          
                Online, Karen pulls up the home page for The Japan Times, an
                English-language newspaper.
          
                She types Toshio's full name into a SEARCH window.
          
                A LIST of links appear, filling the screen. Karen scans
                them. Tries one. It's not what she's looking for.
          
                She re-enters Toshio's name along with a year -- `2001'.
          
                Only ONE LINK appears.   The word `MURDERED' in the headline.
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      64.
          
          
          
                Karen clicks it.   The article fills the screen.
          
                As Karen reads it, we catch glimpses of names -- `Toshio',
                `Kayako', `Takeo'. And an ominous phrase: "MURDER/SUICIDE".
          
                Karen clicks a link marked `IMAGE'. A scanned picture of the
                newspaper appears -- the article is on the front page, with
                familiar photos of Toshio, Kayako and Takeo.
          
                But then Karen's eyes drift to another picture at the bottom
                of the page --
          
                -- PETER. She quickly recognizes him from the picture she
                found in the journal. His name is printed below the photo.
                A picture of Peter and Maria's CONDO BUILDING is next to it.
          
                She looks at the headline:   "AMERICAN ENGLISH TEACHER THROWS
                SELF FROM BUILDING".
          
                Karen scans the article, thinking.   Then she looks up at --
          
                -- TOSHIO'S PICTURE.
          
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

                INT. POLICE STATION - NAKAGAWA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
                Nakagawa is looking at the same picture, in his file.
          
                OFFICER #1 appears in the hall.   Knocks gently on the door.
          
                                     OFFICER #1 (IN JAPANESE)
                           This just came in. It's the
                           surveillance video you requested.
          
                It takes a moment for Nakagawa to snap out of it.
          
                He finally nods, takes the tape. He opens the envelope and
                looks at the cassette. Like he doesn't want to watch it.
          
                Then he turns to a TV/VCR combo and inserts the tape.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the 10TH FLOOR HALLWAY from Susan's office
                building, and the door leading to the stairwell.
          
                A beat.   The image FLICKERS for a moment.
          
                Then the door suddenly bursts open and Susan, terrified, runs
                from the stairwell and down the hall.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA:   he fast-forwards the video.   Until --

                ON SCREEN: -- the SECURITY GUARD appears in the hallway.        As
                Susan saw earlier, he opens the door to the stairwell and
                looks inside. Then he closes the door and continues o.s.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA:   he reaches forward to turn off the video --
          
                ON SCREEN:   -- but then the video CRACKLES with a quick burst
                of static.   And the door to the stairwell opens again.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA: he's watching, entranced, terrified.      He can
                hardly believe what he's seeing --
          
                ON SCREEN: -- A DARK FIGURE EMERGES FROM THE STAIRWELL.    It's
                the shape of a woman with long hair --
          
                -- but the figure is BLURRY AND SHIFTING, as if the black
                shadow has loosely compacted itself into the form of a human.
          
                NAKAGAWA watches, breathless, as THE FIGURE slowly enters the
                hallway, passing by, underneath the camera.
          
                The image stops flickering.    An empty hallway now.   A beat.
          
                Nakagawa, his hand shaking, reaches forward, about to turn
                off the television set, when --
          
                DARKNESS SUDDENLY OVERTAKES THE SCREEN, rising up from the
                bottom until everything is dark. A strange HUMMING RATTLE
                comes from the speakers, and the image JITTERS madly.
          
                Nakagawa leans forward, right up to the screen, trying to
                make out an image in the swirling blackness --
          
                Two eyes open, staring at Nakagawa.
                Terrified, Nakagawa stands and turns away, closing his eyes.
          
                And when he finds the strength to look back --
          
                -- THE EYES are still there.
          
                Locked onto him, even though he's moved.
          
                Unflinching.   Unblinking.

                EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
                Nakagawa stands at the front door.    Gathering his courage.

                 He opens the door.   Nothing but yawning darkness inside.
          
                 Nakagawa picks up TWO HEAVY OBJECTS, one in each hand, and,
                 ducking under the police tape, enters the house.

                 Nakagawa puts the two heavy objects by the front door and
                 closes it. Now we can see what they are --
          
                 -- GASOLINE CANS.    Two gallons each.   Full.
          
                 Nakagawa catches his breath. Then he reaches for the lid of
                 one of the cans, starting to unscrew it. His hands are
                 shaking, and the gasoline SPLASHES AROUND inside --
          
                 -- but then there's ANOTHER SPLASHING SOUND.     From nearby.
          
                 Nakagawa freezes.    The splashing continues.    His eyes go to --
          
                 THE BATHROOM DOOR. It's closed. The SPLASHING is coming
                 from inside, accompanied by a series of THUDS. The sounds of
                 a small child, STRUGGLING...
          
                 Nakagawa fearfully reaches for the door handle --
          
          106a                                                               106a
                 INT. THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
                 Nakagawa's eyes widen as the door swings open.     He sees --
          
                 A YOUNG BOY kneeling by the edge of the tub, overflowing with
                 water. His head hangs below the surface.
          
                 Nakagawa immediately drops to the boy, lifting his lifeless
                 head from the water. It's TOSHIO. He's dead. Drowned.
          
                 Before Nakagawa can understand what's happening, the boy's
                 eyes SUDDENLY OPEN, fixing on Nakagawa --
          
                 -- and then a PALE HAND grabs Nakagawa's head from behind and
                 roughly pushes it into the water, holding him under.

                 muffled by the water. But finally, his legs become still.

                 THE WALL by Karen's computer desk is now covered with WEBPAGE
                 PRINT-OUTS: NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS of TOSHIO and his parents,
                 KAYAKO and TAKEO; MATTHEW and JENNIFER; PETER; and
                 DETECTIVES NAKAGAWA and IGARASHI, plus reports on THE EARLIER
                 INVESTIGATION.
          
                 In the center of it all is a picture of The House.
          
                 ON THE DESK is a PRINT-OUT: the newspaper article about
                 Peter's death, with the photo of his CONDO. Below the photo,
                 Karen has written the number `224'.
          
                 We hear the sound of RUNNING WATER -- it's the shower.   We
                 drift away from the desk and towards the bathroom...

                 Karen is in the shower. She stands there, glassy-eyed, as
                 the water runs over her. She's looking at --
          
                 -- HER REFLECTION in the mirror. It fogs up, obscuring the
                 view. This snaps Karen out of her trance.
          
                 She rinses her hair and squeezes some shampoo into her hand.
                 Starts a nice lather.
          
                 FROM BEHIND: Karen works the shampoo into her scalp.   But,
                 as she does, we see something...
          
                 ... A PALE HAND BURIED UNDER HER HAIR, as if someone is
                 behind her, with a hand on her head.
          
                 Karen's fingers brush the hand.   She CRIES OUT and turns --
          
                 -- there's no one there.   She's alone.

                There's the sound of the front door UNLOCKING and Doug
                enters, carrying a bag. He closes the door behind him and
                walks in, turning the corner --
          
                -- finding Karen, looking a bit dazed, standing right there.
                He's startled, but quickly recovers:
          
                                    DOUG
                          I come bearing gifts.
          
                Karen smiles weakly. She takes the bag and enters the
                kitchen. He watches her go, worried. Then he notices --
          
                HER DESK. Doug walks over, looking at the printouts she's
                taped to the wall. And the photo of The House in the center.
          
                Bewildered, he sits down, leaning forward and taking a good
                look. His eyes stop on the picture of TOSHIO.
          
                Doug turns to see Karen staring at him from the kitchen.
                It's an awkward moment: he's concerned, but doesn't know
                what to say. And neither does Karen.
          
                Finally she approaches, looking at Toshio's picture:

                     That's the boy who was there
                     yesterday. In that house. But
                     this boy, he's --
          
          Her voice trembles, her fear showing through.
          
                               KAREN
                     -- he's supposed to be dead.
          
          A beat.   Karen's eyes plead with Doug.
          
                               KAREN
                     I saw him, Doug. I talked to him.
                     He told me his name. A boy who was
                     killed by his father three years
                     ago told me his name.
          
          Doug looks away, shaking his head.
          
                               KAREN
                     You don't believe me.
          
                               DOUG
                     How can I believe you, Karen?
          
          Karen's face darkens.   Before she can retort --
          
          -- the phone RINGS. As Karen walks across the room to answer
          it, Doug starts reading the newspaper article.
          
                               KAREN (INTO PHONE)
                     Hello?
          
          She listens.   Her face slowly drops.
          
                               KAREN
                         (almost a whisper:)
                     What?
          
          She numbly lowers the phone.   Doug turns to her, seeing that
          something's very wrong.
          
          Snapping to life, Karen walks to the desk, picking up the
          photo of Peter and Maria's condo and a map of Tokyo.
          
          Doug puts a hand on her shoulder.    She finally looks at him.
          
                               KAREN
                     Alex and Yoko are dead.
          
          Doug, surprised, doesn't know what to say.   Karen doesn't
          give him a chance to figure it out:

                    There's something wrong with that
                    house, Doug. Something really bad.
                        (re: Peter's photo)
                    The boy in that house, he had a
                    photo of this man. He died on that
                    same day three years ago. I need
                    to talk to his wife... widow. If I
                    can find out what happened, or
                    if... maybe --

                    Maybe, what?
          
          Karen pulls away, making for the door.   Doug follows.
          
                              DOUG
                    I'm concerned about you going out

                              KAREN
                    Because I've been inside that

                    I've been inside!

          A beat. We see the resolve come over Karen's face.   She
          reaches out and touches Doug tenderly.
          
                              KAREN
                    I love you. But I have to go.
          
          She leaves.
          
          Doug, troubled, turns back to the desk.
          
          He looks up at the wall, tracing a finger over the photo of
          The House. Beneath it, is the address...

                The same building from the newspaper clipping.   Monolithic
                against a cloudy, bleak sky.
          
                Karen stands before it, staring up at it.
          
                Then she walks to the intercom and looks at the directory,
                finds `M. Kirk'. She activates the intercom and dials the
                number. It rings a few times, and then a voice picks up:
          
                                      MARIA (INTERCOM, IN JAPANESE)
                          Yes?

                          you, but I was wondering if I could
                          ask you a few questions.
          
                A long beat.   Karen stares at the intercom.
          
                                      KAREN
                          Ms. Kirk?

                When Maria's voice comes back through the intercom, she
                sounds different, shaken:
          
                                    MARIA (INTERCOM)
                          Leave me alone.

                 The front door opens. MARIA (early 30s) has changed from
                 when we first saw her -- she wears a revealing outfit, and
                 her natural beauty now smolders beneath the surface.
          
                 She regards Karen warily.
          
                                     MARIA
                           I'm late for work.
          
                                     KAREN
                           I just need a couple minutes.
          
                 Maria finally steps aside, letting Karen in.
          
                 The APARTMENT is small, and completely unkempt.    The kitchen
                 is a mess, clothes lie everywhere.
          
                                     MARIA
                               (sarcastic:)
                           Make yourself at home.
          
                 Karen looks for a place to sit.    She decides to stand.
          
                 Maria sizes her up.   A beat.   Then:
          
                                       MARIA
                           Well?
          
                                     KAREN
                           Your husband, Peter.    Three years
                           ago he...
          
                 She trails off, in delicate territory.
          
                                       MARIA
                           He what?
          
                                     KAREN
                           He killed himself.
          
                 Maria eyes her blankly. Then she turns to look at something
                 o.s. Karen follows her gaze --
          
                 -- to the open door of THE BEDROOM.     And THE WINDOW beyond.

                              KAREN
                        (almost ashamed:)
                    I'm... sorry.
          
          Maria turns back to her, sadness on her face.   Then:
          
                                 MARIA
                    Thank you.
          
          Maria reaches for a pack of cigarettes.   Lights one.   Offers
          them to Karen. She shakes her head.
          
                              MARIA
                    How did you know Peter?
          
                                 KAREN
                    I didn't.
          
                              MARIA
                    Then what are you doing here?
          
                              KAREN
                    I think there's a connection
                    between your husband's death and
                    something that happened to me.
          
                              MARIA
                    What happened to you?
          
                              KAREN
                    It's... hard to explain.
          
          Maria takes a drag from her cigarette.    Waiting.
          
                              KAREN
                    Look, I know this sounds strange,
                    but... I don't think your husband
                    wanted to die.
          
                              MARIA
                        (even:)
                    Then why would he throw himself out
                    a window?
          
          Karen struggles to find the answer.
          
                              MARIA
                    Let me guess: `hard to explain'?
          
          Karen nods.   Maria's brave face slips.   She turns away.

                              MARIA
                    I put all this behind me. I don't
                    want to open it back up again.
          
                              KAREN
                    If that's true, then why are you
                    still here in Japan?
          
          Maria turns back.   She only looks defensive for a moment.
          
                              MARIA
                    Because I can't leave. I tried.
                    But I couldn't. Not without...
          
          Maria speaks softly, forming words she's never spoken aloud:
          
                              MARIA
                    He usually didn't wake up before
                    me. But that morning, he did. He
                    made coffee for us. Then he sat
                    there and waited for me to wake up.
                    And when I did, he looked me right
                    in the eye. And then he jumped.
                    The night before we'd been talking
                    about having children together...
          
          She wipes away the tears in her eyes.
          
                              KAREN
                    Did you know a woman named Kayako?
          
                                 MARIA
                    No.
          
                                 KAREN
                    Did Peter?
          
                              MARIA
                    I don't think so.
          
          Maria turns away, growing tense.
          
                              KAREN
                    Maybe it was someone he worked
                    with?
          
                              MARIA
                    Look. I've had the police up here,
                    I talked with Detectives, I even
                    hired a P.I.--

                              MARIA (cont'd)
                    I don't know what you're going
                    through, or what you think you know
                    about my husband. But I don't have
                    any answers. I'm sorry.
          
          She turns back to Karen -- to find the young woman sitting
          slumped on the edge of a sofa, tears in her eyes.
          
          Maria softens as Karen looks up at her, pleading:
          
                             KAREN
                    Please. I don't know what else to
                    do. Please help me.

                 Maria reaches up to a high shelf. She moves a few things
                 aside to get to TWO SHOEBOXES buried towards the rear.
          
          
          118    OMITTED                                                     118

                 Maria re-enters the room, laying the shoeboxes on a table.
          
                                     MARIA
                           This is all his stuff from school.
          
                 She stares at the boxes, afraid to open them. Karen sits
                 down and gently removes the lid of one of them.
          
                 THE BOX contains stacks of PHOTOGRAPHS and notes. Karen
                 removes a pile of photos and starts looking through it.
          
                 After a moment, Maria sits down next to her. She opens the
                 other box and pulls out another stack of photos.
          
                 She looks at the first one, sadness crossing her face.
          
                                     MARIA
                           This was our first date.
          
                 She shows Karen THE TOP PHOTO: a "self-portrait" of Peter
                 and Maria in a park lined with blooming cherry trees.
          
                 The pain returns, and she puts the picture away.
          
                 Karen works through her own pile: she's looking at pictures
                 of Peter from his University days.
          
                 Her eyes widen as she sees --
          
                 Kayako. She looks young and alive... but yet somehow sullen
                 and withdrawn, as if she feels she doesn't belong there.
          
                 She's with a group of fellow students. PETER is in the
                 group, although he and Kayako aren't next to one another.
          
                 Karen turns to the next picture -- it's a graduation party.
          
                 Kayako is in this one too: standing to the side, watching
                 PETER AND MARIA as they give a goofy grin to the camera.

          As Karen flips through them, a definite pattern emerges --
          
          -- Kayako is in practically every picture.
          
          And in most, she's not smiling at the camera.    Rather, she's
          staring at Peter.
          
                               KAREN
                        (under her breath:)
                    Oh my God.
          
                               MARIA
                    What?   Did you find something?
          
          We move to THE GROUP PHOTO. Peter with Maria, surrounded by
          classmates. Kayako off to the side, her eyes on Peter.

                The same GROUP PHOTO is in a frame on Peter's desk.
          
                Peter stands behind the desk, using a small mirror to knot
                his tie. His open door reads: `DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH'.
          
                A CO-WORKER (20s, Japanese) enters with a stack of mail.
          
                                    PETER
                          Happy Monday.
          
                                    CO-WORKER
                          Yeah, right. Here's your mail.
          
                He hands it to Peter. On the top is a small BLUE ENVELOPE.
                The name in the return address is `Kayako'.
          
                                          Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       79.
          
          
          
                                     CO-WORKER
                           Another one, huh?
          
                 Peter shakes his head, looking distastefully at the letter.
          
                                     PETER
                           I don't even know her. She says I
                           used to tutor her, but I don't know
                           who the hell she is.
          
                 The co-worker shrugs and leaves.    Disturbed, Peter fingers
                 the blue envelope.
          
                 His eyes go to one of his desk drawers.    He slides it open.
          
                 More BLUE ENVELOPES are inside.    All from `KAYAKO'.
          
                 Peter's face darkens.   He dumps the letters into a trash can.
          
          120                                                                120
                 EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
                 Peter stands in front of The House.
          
                 He glances down at the BLUE ENVELOPE in his hand. He stuffs
                 it in his pocket, unsure about what he's going to do.
          
                 Then he opens the gate and goes in, walking to the front
                 door. Knocks. Silence from inside. He rings the bell.
                 Waits. No one comes. He's about to leave --
          
                 But then he hears something from around the side of the
                 house. It sounded like a muffled SPLASH of water.
          
          
          120a   EXT. THE HOUSE - SIDE - DAY                                120a
          
                 Peter peers around the side of the house, a narrow walkway
                 lined with bushes and trees. It's quiet.
          
                                      PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                           Hello?   Excuse me?
          
                 After a moment, Peter decides to check it out. As he steps
                 around a bush, he suddenly stops, surprised to see --
          
                 PETER'S POV: two ARMS hang from a window at the side of the
                 house. They look disembodied, mottled and bruised.

          It takes Peter a moment to recover.   He slowly walks over.

                A familiar BOY is inside -- it's TOSHIO. His glazed and
                staring eyes don't seem to notice Peter, standing right in
                front of him.
          
                                     PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Hello.
          
                No reaction. There's definitely something wrong with this
                boy. Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          My name is Peter. I'm here to see
                          your mother. Is she home?
          
                The boy slowly straightens. His eyes focus on Peter. Then
                he FALLS BACKWARDS. Startled, Peter tries to see inside:
          
                                     PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Hey!   Are you okay??? Hello???
          
                Peter quickly goes back to the front door.   Tries the handle -
                - it's unlocked. He opens the door.

                INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY
                Peter steps inside, unsure about entering uninvited.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                              (calling out)
                          Hello? Excuse me. I'm coming in.
          
                His concern for the boy wins out. He kicks off his shoes,
                and quickly walks to the open bathroom door.

                Peter enters, finding Toshio lying on the floor. He must
                have been standing on the edge of a TUB by the window.

                          Are you alright?
          
                As Peter helps the boy to his feet, he glances at the
                bathtub. It's filled, literally to the brim, with water.
          
          
          124   INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                             124
          
                Peter holds Toshio's hand as he leads him back to a couch in
                the living room.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Are you alone? Where are your
                          parents?
          
                The boy sits in the couch, slumped over, still looking dazed.
          
                Peter studies him, looking at the ugly BRUISES on his arms
                and legs. There's also a big one around his neck.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          What happened to you?
          
                Peter reaches out to lift Toshio's chin, but he FLINCHES,
                pulling backwards. His eyes manage to focus on Peter.
          
                Then the boy looks away.    Lowers his head.   A long beat.
          
                Peter's worried. This really doesn't look good.     He scans
                the messy room, eyes falling on something.
          
                He reaches down and picks up PIECES OF A PHOTOGRAPH, lying
                next to a broken frame -- they've been crumpled into a ball.
          
                ON THE PHOTO: Peter unfolds the pieces and rearranges them.
                We've seen this picture before --
          
                -- a FAMILY PORTRAIT. TOSHIO, holding a cute BLACK CAT.
                Standing with his mother and father -- KAYAKO and TAKEO.
                They're all beaming at the camera, a perfect, happy family.
          
                Except that the mother's face has been torn out.
          
                Then there's a muffled MEOW.    Peter looks over at the window.
                Did that come from outside?
          
                Another MEOW.   Peter walks to the window, looking out.
          
                FROM OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN: a worried look crosses Peter's
                face as the MEOW becomes more of a GROWL, as if in warning.
                He looks outside, but can't see anything --

                -- but we see, over Peter's shoulder, that TOSHIO is now
                LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIM, eyes wide --

                Karen enters quickly, going up to the front desk.
          
                OFFICER #2, filling out paperwork, doesn't look up.
          
                                    KAREN (IN JAPANESE)
                          Excuse me, I need to speak with
                          Detective Nakagawa.
          
                Officer #2 looks up at her.   Blankly.
          
                                    KAREN (IN JAPANESE)
                          It's an emergency.
          
                                    OFFICER #2 (IN JAPANESE)
                          One moment.
          
                Officer #2 walks to the end of the desk, where two more
                OFFICERS speak in hushed tones with DETECTIVE AOKI.
          
                Officer #2 interrupts their conversation. And they all look
                over at Karen. A beat. Then Detective Aoki approaches.
          
                                    AOKI (IN ENGLISH)
                          You are asking for Detective
                          Nakagawa?
          
                                    KAREN
                          Yes, I have important information
                          for him about a case...
          
                She looks around. Everyone is watching her. The mood is
                decidedly grim. She can tell something's up.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Detective Nakagawa is not here
                          right now. Can you tell me what
                          case this is regarding?
          
                There's something behind the Detective's words.
          
                                    KAREN
                          His partner, Detective Igarashi?
                          Can I speak with him?

                Aoki exchanges a look with the officers.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Can you tell me your name, please?
          
                Karen looks at the somber faces in the quiet station.     She
                backs away from the desk as the realization sinks in.
          
                                    KAREN
                          They're dead, aren't they?
          
                Karen turns and runs for the exit.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Miss, wait please --
          
                But she's long gone.

                A reading light on the computer desk provides the only
                illumination in the dark apartment.
          
                Karen enters, standing in the doorway for a moment.     Shell-
                shocked. As she slides off her coat:
          
                                       KAREN
                          Doug?

          No answer. She slowly walks to the bedroom and looks inside.
          He's not there. This seems to worsen Karen's mood.
          
                                     Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       84.
          
          
          
          Karen looks down at a NOTEPAD. She's written THREE JAPANESE
          NAMES. The detectives in charge of the case three years ago.
          
          They all have red lines drawn through them.
          
          Then we PAN UP to see that these are the last names on a
          longer list. We recognize the other names: MATTHEW,
          JENNIFER, and EMMA WILLIAMS; YOKO and ALEX; NAKAGAWA and
          IGARASHI. Everyone who's been in The House.
          
          Everyone who died.   All the names have been CROSSED OUT --
          
          -- except `Nakagawa' and `Igarashi'.    Karen picks up a red
          pen and draws a line through them.
          
          Then we see one final name at the bottom:
          
          `Me.'   Now the only one not crossed out.   The only one left.
          
          Karen puts down her pen.    Then she looks up at --
          
          -- THE WALL, where's she's taped all the pictures and
          articles in a circle.
          
          Karen realizes something.    She reaches for the lamp, and
          turns it closer --
          
          -- the picture in the middle of the "spider's web" is gone.
          
          The photo of The House.
          
          Karen draws a breath. Then, out of the corner of her eye,
          she sees something she hadn't noticed before --
          
          -- a faint red FLASHING from a small table by the kitchen.
          
          She slowly stands. Walks over to it. The flashing red light
          is barely visible on her face, as she looks down at --
          
          -- HER ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message light is blinking.
          
          `1 MESSAGE'.
          
          She reaches out a shaky finger and presses `PLAY'.
          
                               DOUG (ON MACHINE)
                     "Hey, Karen. It's me. I just
                     wanted to say -- I'm sorry. I know
                     I wasn't hearing you.

                  Karen presses the STOP button.
          
                  She stands there for a moment, in the near-darkness.
          
                  Then, softly:
          
                                        KAREN

                  Zippo and ducks under the tape, walking up to --
          
                  THE FRONT DOOR. Doug tries the handle, and the door swings

                  As he takes a step forward his foot bumps THE GAS CANS, still
                  sitting by the front door.
          
                  He's confused -- and then he gets a good idea.   He tosses his
                  cigarette outside and closes the front door.

                 inside, trying to let his eyes adjust to the dark.
          
                 Then he walks down the hall to the REAR ROOM.   Does the same.
                 Nothing but darkness beyond.
          
                 Doug closes the door and turns away from it, wondering why
                 he's here, what he's looking for.
          
                 He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone.
                 Speed-dials Karen's number. As he raises it to his ear --
          
                 -- he doesn't notice the door to the rear room SLOWLY
                 SWINGING OPEN BEHIND HIM --
          
          127                                                               127
                 EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
                 Karen runs towards us, breathless, stopping as she reaches --
          
                 -- THE HOUSE.   Looming over her.    Waiting.
          
                 She only hesitates a moment before running inside.
          
          
          128    INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT                                     128
          
                 Karen enters, calling out:
          
                                      KAREN
                           Doug!   Where are you???
          
                 A MUFFLED SOUND from upstairs.    A voice.
          
                                      KAREN
                           Doug???
          
                 Karen immediately runs up the stairs to --
          
                 THE SECOND FLOOR. Before she reaches the top of the stairs,
                 Karen suddenly realizes:
          
                 THE VOICE she's hearing isn't Doug's.
          
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                           Hey, Maria, it's me. Yeah, I'm
                           still at school...
          
                 Karen slowly looks up to see --
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        87.
          
          
          
                -- PETER. She recognizes him immediately.    He's standing in
                the hallway, talking on his cell phone.
          
                                    PETER (INTO PHONE)
                          ...I know, I'm sorry -- these staff
                          meetings always run over -- maybe
                          another ten minutes or so -- okay,
                          I'll be home soon -- I love you
                          too.
          
                He hangs up.   Leans against the wall.   Looking into --
          
                THE FRONT BEDROOM. Karen gasps as she sees TOSHIO through
                the open door. He's sitting on the ground, making drawings
                of BLACK CATS. This is his bedroom.
          
                                    PETER
                              (under his breath)
                          Guess your mom's late, huh?
          
                Then Toshio suddenly looks up.   Right at Karen.
          
                Following Toshio's gaze, Peter quickly turns to face Karen.
                But even though she's right there, he doesn't see her:
          
                She's seeing something that happened three years ago.
          
                As if sensing her presence, Peter walks right to the edge of
                the stairs, looking down. Then:
          
                A RUSTLING SOUND comes from the dark hallway. Peter turns
                towards the REAR BEDROOM at the end of the hall.
          
          129                                                                129
                INT. THE HOUSE - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
                Peter stands in the doorway, looking into the MASTER BEDROOM
                of Toshio's parents. His attention is drawn to something
                near the door --
          
                -- a DESK. It's got a computer, some files.     Someone's
                personal work space.
          
                Peter steps to the desk. He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS.
                Family pictures: with father (TAKEO), mother (KAYAKO), and
                son (TOSHIO), holding his black CAT.
          
                KAYAKO'S FACE has been torn out of every one.
          
                Peter notices something underneath the pile of photos -- a
                familiar JOURNAL. The same one Karen found in the closet.
                He opens it.
          
                                   Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        88.
          
          
          
          HIS POV: it's a journal Kayako kept. As Peter flips through
          it, KAYAKO'S VOICE speaks the words...
          
          ...and even though it's mostly Japanese, there's one word we
          recognize, that she's written repeatedly --
          
          -- "Peter". It's been written over and over, in both English
          and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it.
          
          Past the early pages Karen saw, THE WRITING becomes more
          manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl,
          KAYAKO'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading.
          
          Taped on the final page is A PHOTO: PETER with a group of
          his University friends, at a party. Kayako has scribbled
          hearts around his head, and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces.
          
          A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter's face.   It's still wet.
          
          Peter slams the book shut and drops it. As he does, a
          PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside, landing right-side up.
          
          THE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party, talking with MARIA.
          It's clear they're having a great time with one another...
          
          ...but the photo is TORN IN HALF, splitting Maria's face.
          And KAYAKO is visible between them, sadly and stoically
          watching Peter, strands of hair falling down her face.
          
          Peter and Karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same
          time -- and they BUMP SHOULDERS. Karen falls backwards,
          against the wall.
          
          In disbelief, Peter looks around wildly. He reaches out a
          tentative hand, feeling around... Karen moves out of the way.
          She can't understand how this could be happening.
          
          As Peter is about to stand back up, SOMETHING small flutters
          down from above, landing on the floor in front of him.
          
          It's KAYAKO'S FACE.   One of the missing pieces from the torn-
          out photographs.
          
          Peter slowly looks up to see --
          
          -- ALL THE MISSING KAYAKO FACES have been pinned to the
          closet door. Many of the pins go through HER EYES.
          
          And that's when Peter and Karen hear THE FLIES.   Buzzing
          anxiously. Sounds like there's a lot of them.
          
          It's coming from THE CLOSET.   Just behind the torn-out faces.

          Karen watches, terrified, as Peter reaches out a hand --
          
          -- and slides the door open.
          
          He immediately recoils.    A terrible stench inside.
          
          The BUZZING of the flies is louder.    Coming from above.
          
          Peter pulls a book of matches from his pocket.    Lights one.
          
          And looks up.
          
          HIS POV:   the attic panel is slightly open.
          
          Peter reaches up to open it fully --
          
          -- AND THE UPPER HALF OF KAYAKO swings down.
          
          She's been wrapped in plastic sheeting, mottled splotches of
          blood on the inside. Her neck hangs at an odd angle.
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       89.
          
          
          
                Peter backs away in horror --
          
          
          130   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT               130
          
                Peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard.
          
                Then a familiar sound reaches our ears:   THUD.   THUD.   THUD.
          
                It's coming from Toshio's room. And it's the same rhythmic
                THUDDING we've heard coming from this room before.
          
                Peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads
                quickly down the hall (with Karen following him):
          
                                     PETER
                          Toshio!   We have to --
          
                He stops short at the door, as he sees --
          
                -- TAKEO, Toshio's father. Eyes rolled back in his head,
                tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips.
          
                He's dead -- he's hanging from the ceiling by BLACK HAIR that
                seems to cover its entire surface. Kayako's hair.
          
                TOSHIO, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings
                the body. Takeo's feet THUD rhythmically against the wall.
          
                                    KAREN
                          Oh my God...
          
                Peter doesn't stay to see any more.   He runs.
          
          131                                                               131
                INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
          
                Peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door,
                passing a mirror --
          
                -- he freezes. He saw SOMETHING in the reflection as he
                passed. Something wrong.
                He takes a step back and looks --
          
                -- it's not his reflection in the mirror.   It's KAYAKO.
          
                Peter stares at the image in disbelief. Then he notices
                TOSHIO standing next to Kayako, looking up at her.
          
                                 Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     89A.
          
          
          
          As Peter slowly turns to look down, a small PALE HAND slips
          into his own. Peter jerks backward in shock as --
          
          A SERIES OF IMAGES, THE ORIGIN OF "THE GRUDGE", FLASH BY:
          
          -- TAKEO, looking down at THE JOURNAL, reading his wife's
          words, his face contorted with rage... he turns to see
          KAYAKO, home from work, standing in the doorway...
          
                                    Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      90.
          
          
          
          -- KAYAKO running down the steps, TAKEO chasing her, tackling
          her before she can reach the door... sitting on top of her,
          he wraps his hands around her neck...
          
          -- KAYAKO seeing TOSHIO, her son, watching through the bars
          of the second floor railing as...
          
          -- TAKEO snaps Kayako's neck with an audible CRACK...
          
          -- KAYAKO, not dead, but paralyzed, watching as...
          
          -- TAKEO drowns a flailing TOSHIO in the bathroom tub...
          
          -- TAKEO tears apart TOSHIO'S CAT, still alive, in the
          bathroom sink...
          
          -- KAYAKO letting out a HORRIBLE CROAKING, the only sound her
          broken neck can emit, as TAKEO advances on her with a knife,
          his eyes filled with a manic madness...
          
          -- TAKEO in THE ATTIC, stuffing KAYAKO and TOSHIO, both very
          dead, wrapped in plastic sheeting, into a corner...
          
          -- KAYAKO suddenly TURNING HER HEAD and GRABBING TAKEO'S
          ARM... her lifeless eyes focusing on Takeo's as she CROAKS...
          Takeo's eyes go wide with fear... and TOSHIO suddenly reaches
          from his plastic grave, grabbing Takeo's other arm...
          
          BACK TO THE PRESENT:
          
          We PAN FROM Peter to THE REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR --
          
          It's not the pale, frightening Kayako anymore. Rather:     a
          beautiful, young Kayako with eyes filled with sorrow.
          
          We PAN BACK to see KAREN standing there, instead of Peter.
          
          Karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror, the
          revelation taking everything out of her.
          
          A beat.   Then:
                    That came from upstairs.
          THUMP.
          Karen looks up as the sound continues. We PAN OVER towards
          the stairs as A DRAGGING sound moves across the ceiling.
          Accompanied by a strange SCRAPING, like plastic.
          
                                KAREN
                      No more... please, no more...
          
          She suddenly freezes, sensing something next to her. We see
          it now, as she turns her head, almost hidden in the darkness--
          
                                  Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      91.
          
          
          
          -- a PALE FACE in the darkened hallway, staring up at the
          ceiling. Eyes wide and rolled back, mouth yawning open in
          abject terror --
          
          -- it's DOUG'S BODY. He lies on his back, his top half
          sticking out from a niche by the stairwell. It's been right
          next to her all along.
          
                               KAREN
                    DOUG!   NO!!!
          
          Karen takes Doug into her arms as the SOUNDS continue above,
          growing closer. But it's no use -- he's dead.
          
          And now there's a new sound, moving down the stairs. A
          familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND, along with a strange
          SKITTERING, like the world's biggest cockroach.
          
          Karen turns to the staircase to see --
          
          -- KAYAKO, crawling down the stairs. Still wrapped in the
          plastic sheeting, she moves like a wounded animal, neck
          hanging limply, struggling to pull herself forward --
          
          -- her eyes locked on Karen, CROAKING horribly --
          
          Karen sorrow turns to abject terror. She tries to lift
          Doug's body and pull it to the front door. It's too heavy.
          
          And KAYAKO is getting closer.
          
          Sobbing, Karen drops Doug and falls back against the front
          door, bumping into --
          
          THE GAS CANS. The one Nakagawa unscrewed TIPS OVER, spilling
          gasoline into the entryway.
          
          As Doug's arm flops to the floor, his outstretched HAND lands
          next to Karen. She sees something clenched in his fingers --
          
          -- his ZIPPO LIGHTER.
          
          Realization dawns over Karen as she feels the liquid spilling
          onto her hands. The odor is unmistakable.
          
          Karen immediately reaches forward, trying to loosen Doug's
          grip on the lighter as --
          
          -- Kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs. Her broken neck
          makes a horrific CRACKING as she swivels to face Karen.
          
          Karen finally gets the lighter. She pushes back against the
          door with legs too numb to stand. Her eyes drift up to see --
          
                                 Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     91A.
          
          
          
          -- TOSHIO, watching from the railing above, as before, his
          cold eyes locked on hers.
          
          Karen grabs another can, and spins the lid until it pops off.
          She tips it onto the floor, spilling more gas.

                 Kayako doesn't seem to care. She crawls over Doug's body and
                 pulls herself through the gasoline, slowly, drawing
                 inexorably closer --
          
                 Karen drops the empty gas can and opens DOUG'S LIGHTER.
          
                 She flicks it.   Nothing.
          
                 Karen tries the lighter again.     And again.   Nothing.
          
                 Kayako reaches out, blood dripping from her gaping mouth --
          
                 The lighter CATCHES.
          
                 Karen flails with her free arm and opens the front door --
          
                 -- just as Kayako GRABS HER ANKLE.
          
                 Karen reaches outside, anchoring a hand to the door frame --
          
                 -- but she can't pull herself free, as --
          
                 -- Kayako pulls herself closer, her CROAKING intensifying --
          
                 -- resigned, Karen slowly lowers the flame to the gas can --
          
                 -- and ignites the gas!     There's a sudden BRIGHT FLASH that
                 overtakes the screen --
          
                                                                 FADE TO WHITE:

                 EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
                 The flashing lights of POLICE CARS wash over the formerly
                 quiet neighborhood, illuminating --
          
                                          Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    93.
          
          
          
                 KAREN. She's lying on a gurney, regaining consciousness.
                 Japanese EMTS are speaking to her as she's being loaded into
                 the back of an ambulance.
          
                 KAREN'S POV: the blurry forms of FIREMEN rush by in slow
                 motion. Everything is dizzy and incoherent...
          
                 Karen tries to sit up -- but a YOUNG EMT lays a gentle hand
                 on her arm, deftly sliding a needle under her skin. The
                 sedative takes hold almost immediately.
          
                 Karen sinks back into the gurney, her eyes rolling back in
                 her head. She's fading fast.

                 The EMTs secure the gurney inside and close the doors. Karen
                 fights the drug, but its grip is inevitable: she finally
                 gives up, sliding into a medicated sleep.
          
                 We slowly MOVE IN on her face, until it fills the screen.
          
                 Then...

                 INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
                 ...the light CHANGES. Darkness becomes morning sunlight
                 spilling across Karen's face. The tranquil sound of birds
                 CHIRPING surrounds us. But it sounds like a distant echo.
          
                 Karen's eyelids flutter. She opens her eyes and sits up, now
                 wide awake -- but peaceful and calm.
          
                 She gently swings her legs from the gurney and walks to the
                 window, confused by the daylight. She looks out to see --

                 EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
                 It's the most beautiful we've ever seen it.   A lush
                 springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around the place.
          
                 VOICES off-screen (Japanese) are audible, getting closer --

          ON KAREN, as she is surprised to see...
          
          KAYAKO. Beautiful and meek. She's smiling, walking hand-in-
          hand with TAKEO. A happy couple.
          
          As they reach the front door and go inside, Kayako turns back
          to the front gate. She smiles and gestures, "come on".
          
          And then TOSHIO walks forward, through the gate.   His
          attention is on a tiny BLACK KITTEN in his arms.
          
          At the door, Toshio turns to look back over his shoulder --
          
          -- DIRECTLY AT KAREN. They hold each other's gaze for a
          moment, as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance.
          
          Then Kayako gestures to Toshio, and he turns away, entering
          The House and closing the door.
          
                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

          EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- PACIFIC PALISADES, CA -- MORNING

          It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop
          the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the
          exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn,
          setting up a high-end wedding.
          A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange
          centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables...

          INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

          A simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in
          this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table,
          surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY
          TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup.
          Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in.

                              MR. TURNER
                    Any word from Doug?
          The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
          about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.

                              TRACY
                    No, but I'm sure he's--
          Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it.

                              TRACY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

                                                     INTERCUT WITH:

          EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- MORNING

          Heat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust-
          covered payphone in the middle of the desert is

          VICK LENNON
          He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess.
          His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent,
          his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.

                              VICK
                    Tracy, it's Vick.
          Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967
          Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy -
          - and missing its passenger side door.
          Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.

          

                                                                      2.

          

          

                                TRACY
                    Hey Vick!

                              VICK
                    Listen, honey...The bachelor party
                    got a little out of control and,
                    well...we lost Doug.

                              TRACY
                        (her jaw dropping)
                    What?! But we're getting married in
                    like four hours!
          Vick squints at the rising sun.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

          EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY

          The top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the
          stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down
          Highway 10 towards Nevada.
          At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half-
          open shirt and mint condition aviators.
          Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's,
          handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy.
          Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax
          attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his
          khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.
          Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school
          linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the
          back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this
          is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is.

                              STU
                    Dude this is already the best
                    weekend ever!

                              VICK
                    Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.

          

                                                                      3.

          

          

                              STU
                    Oh, did I show you pictures of my
                    kids?!

                              DOUG
                    No, dude, show `em.
          Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them
          to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this
          group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.

                              STU
                    Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is
                    already four! Can you believe it?!

                              DOUG
                        (smiling at photos)
                    How cute... Good for you, man.
          Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.

                              VICK
                    The one on the left is gonna be a
                    hottie. The other one, not so much.
          Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:

                              STU
                    Jesus, dude, those are my children--

                              ALAN
                        (re: sunscreen)
                    Hey, am I rubbed in?
          Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over
          Alan's face.

                              STU
                    Yeah, you're good.

                              DOUG
                    Hey so Alan, are you and Becky
                    still together?
          But before Alan can answer--

                              VICK
                    Of course they are, Doug. Jesus,
                    Alan's been dating Becky for 14
                    years. When they first met, Alan
                    had braces and soccer hair, and
                    Becky had a functioning hymen.

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                    4.

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Asking Alan if he's still with
                    Becky is like asking the sun if it
                    still rises in the east.
          The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.

                              DOUG
                    She still pressuring you to get
                    married?

                              ALAN
                    Enh, we've moved past the pressure
                    stage...it's more like aggravated
                    assault stage now? Like at the last
                    wedding we went to, she threw a
                    camera at my head, called me a
                    closet fag, then ran out crying.
          The guys wince, oooo.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    But we talked, and everything's
                    cool now.

                              STU
                    Maybe you could wear a helmet to
                    Doug's wedding.

                              ALAN
                    Great idea, Stu. Thanks.

                              DOUG

                        (LAUGHING)
                    So Vick, how's business going?

                              VICK
                    Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on
                    bringing the next big dessert craze
                    to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.

                              DOUG
                    What is it?

                              VICK
                    Bavarian custard. We ran the
                    numbers, and it's gonna be bigger
                    than fro yo.
          Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.

                              ALAN
                    Isn't custard like a trillion
                    calories--?

          

                                                                  5.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Our plan is to open three stores in
                    the Valley and then franchise it.
                    Shares are selling fast, but I can
                    probably squeeze you guys in...

                              DOUG
                    Yeah, man, count me in.

                              STU
                    Me too, man! I love pudding!
          Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.

                              ALAN
                    Is this gonna do better than the
                    hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or
                    the topless sushi bar? Or the
                    mobile tattoo parlor--?

                              VICK
                    Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of
                    it's time, Alan! And don't come
                    crying to me when there's a Custard
                    Cabana on every street corner in
                    America and you didn't buy in--!

                    All right, all right, save it for
                    the party...
          Vick and Alan quiet. Stu is still drumming the seat.

                              STU
                    Dude! I can't believe I get to
                    party all night, and then, tomorrow
                    ...I get to sleep in! It's almost
                    too much! And FYI, if anyone gets
                    really drunk and craps themself,
                    just let me know, I can have you
                    cleaned up and partying again in
                    under three minutes. No joke. I am
                    a master of stool removal...
          They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...

          EXT. LAS VEGAS -- MAGIC HOUR

          As the last rays of sun fade, the Cadillac crests the final
          hill to reveal LAS VEGAS in all its illuminated splendor...

          EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. -- SUNSET

          The Caddy rolls down the famed Strip. We are again reminded
          of the absurd scale of Las Vegas. The 5,000 room hotels, the
          eight lane roads, the 60 foot billboards...

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          The Caddy rolls up to the Mandalay Bay. The guys hop out,
          exhilarated. Vick throws the key to the VALET...

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          The guys enter the glittering casino four men-wide, all
          smiling, all exuding vibe. Passing WOMEN sneak glances. Vick
          slides a drink off a nearby waitress's tray as they make for

          THE FRONT DESK
          A perfectly pressed LEBANESE MAN waits behind the front desk.
          Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on.

                              FRONT DESK MAN
                    Welcome to the Mandalay Bay.

                              VICK
                    Checking in. Lennon comma Victor.
          The man types into his computer.

                              FRONT DESK MAN
                    Yes, we have you down for a one
                    night stay in an economy suite--
          Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads "ATASHIR."

                              VICK
                    Hold it right there, Atashir. This
                    is my best friend from childhood,
                    Douglas Billings. In two days, he
                    is to marry a woman of great beauty
                    and strong teeth, do you
                    understand? A woman of gigantic
                    bosoms who will give him many, many
                    sons...
          Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed.

          

                                                                   7.

          

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    My two other childhood friends have
                    travelled great distances, across
                    many deserts, to be here. This
                    isn't a night in a hotel for us,
                    Atashir: this is a family reunion.
                    Perhaps you too have family
                    situated great distances away, in a
                    foreign country with much sand?
          Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter
          and touches his arm, simpatico.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Then I have but one question for
                    you, friend: if they came to town,
                    would you put them in an economy
                    suite?

                               ATASHIR
                    No, sir.

                              VICK
                    Well, then. I think one of us needs
                    to get back on his little computer
                    and find us a suitable room.
          Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer.

                              ATASHIR
                    All the deluxe rooms are taken. The
                    Dean Martin suite is available, but
                    I'd have to ask my--

                              VICK
                    Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case
                    of Cristal, two bottles of Patron,
                    four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of
                    skinless mangos...
          Vick turns to the guys:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    You guys want anything?
          The guys stammer, too stunned to speak.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen
                    of those duck skewers I like so
                    well. He knows the ones.

                              ATASHIR
                    And how would you like to pay?

          

                                                                    8.

          

          

                              VICK
                    American Express.
          Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns
          to Alan:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Dude, give him your AmEx.

                              ALAN
                    What?

                              VICK
                    Don't worry, we'll hit you later.
          Alan stammers.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop
                    being such a Jew.
          Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card.

                                                              CUT TO:

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT

          The guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a
          headlock. Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive,
          complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and
          multiple bedrooms. The guys just gape.

                              STU
                    This is bigger than my house.
          Vick blows past them, totally unfazed.

                               VICK
                    Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels
                    up in ten.
          Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan
          standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite.

                              ALAN
                    I am so not getting paid back.

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Vick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing
          his shirt -- when his cell phone RINGS. He answers.

                              VICK
                    This is Vick.

          

                                                                    9.

          

          
          Vick listens -- then grows a bit panicked:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me!

                        (WINCING)
                    All right, I'll get it. All right.
                    All right--!
          When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone,
          trying to keep the call confidential:

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    I said all right, dude! How many
                    more times you want me to say all
                    right?!

                        (BEAT)
                    All right. All right.
          Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed...

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- BATHROOM -- SAME

          Doug brushes his teeth while, at the next sink over, Alan
          selects a facial wash from his highly organized toiletries
          kit and begins washing his face.

                              ALAN
                    So, you ready for Sunday?

                              DOUG
                    Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but
                    I'm actually just really psyched.
          Alan nods, impressed.

                              ALAN
                    Tracy's dad still hate you?

                               DOUG
                    Oh yeah.

                              ALAN
                    Any closer to figuring out why?

                              DOUG
                    Enh, I think he wanted more for his
                    girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who
                    makes 45 grand a year, and he's a
                    titan of industry who makes 45
                    grand a day, you know? I sort of
                    get it...
                        (beat, brushing teeth)
                    Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm
                    not sure you ever get past that.

          

                                                                  10.

          

          
          Alan smiles, yeah, there's that. Doug spits out his paste.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    You got floss?
          Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up,
          starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something --
          but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's
          kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    Holy Christ!
          Alan quickly reaches for the ring--

                              ALAN
                    Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell
                    anyone about that--
          Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE
          BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable.

                              STU
                    Anyone got any nipple lube--?
                        (seeing ring)
                    Jesus would you look at the size of
                    that thing?!
          Stu grabs the ring from Doug.

                              DOUG
                    It's Alan's. For Becky.

                              STU
                    Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?

                              ALAN
                        (clutching for ring)
                    Actually, I-I was trying to keep it
                    a secret, so--
          Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:

                              VICK
                    Boy Party in the bathrooooom--!
                        (sees ring, snags it)
                    Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight
                    pink tint, street value: 26, 27K.
          Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples.

                              STU
                    Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's
                    finally going to propose!

          

                                                                  11.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good
                    for you! Where'd you get the ring?

                              ALAN
                    Oh, it's a family heirloom. My
                    grandmother smuggled it through the
                    Holocaust, actually. I was going to
                    propose to Beck this weekend.
          Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him.

                               DOUG
                    Well: now we have two things to
                    celebrate!

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          The guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door
          and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick
          is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses.
          Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the
          door and the frame so they aren't locked up here.
          The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the
          stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless
          stars... It's breathtaking.

                              STU
                    Thish is so great! I love you guys!

                              VICK
                    Check it out, Stu's already wasted.
          Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.

                              ALAN
                    We've only had two shots, man!

                    Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You
                    used to be able to drink us all
                    under the table!

                              STU
                    Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time

                                                                     12.

          

          

                                DOUG
                    What? No!

                              STU
                    Because my dad was a bad dad.

                              DOUG
                        (patting his shoulder)
                    That's true, Stuey, but you're
                    different. We've talked about this.
          Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat.

                              STU
                    Have I showed you guys pictures of
                    my kids yet--?

                                ALAN & DOUG & VICK

                    YES!
          Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:

                              DOUG
                    Little toast: to Tracy, the
                    coolest, kindest, most beautiful
                    woman I've ever met. I can't
                    believe she let me come this
                    weekend -- much less agreed to
                    spend the rest of her life with me.
                    I think both will prove to be
                    massive errors of judgement on her
                    part.
          The guys chuckle, hear-hear.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    And to being here, with my best
                    friends in the world. There's
                    nowhere else I'd rather be.
          The guys raise their glasses, touched.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    That said, let's not get too stupid
                    tonight, okay? I'm getting married
                    in 36 hours.

                              ALAN & STU & VICK
                    No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
                    dude.
          Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced.

          

                                                                    13.

          

          

                              DOUG
                    I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above
                    the neck -- no piercings, no weird
                    haircuts, no facial tattoos. I
                    gotta look decent on Sunday.

                              VICK
                    Jesus, what do you take us for?

                              DOUG
                    Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows
                    off the night before graduation!

                              STU
                    Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And
                    remember when I blacked out at
                    Homecoming and you wrote on my face
                    with permanent marker?! That was
                    awesome! What'd you write again?

                              ALAN & DOUG & VICK
                    "Respect me!"
          They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic.

                              STU
                    Ahh, good times, man. Good times...

                              VICK
                    We'll be good tonight, Doug.

                              ALAN
                    Seriously, man, we're your friends.

                              STU
                    Yeah, we've totally grown up since
                    then.
          Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.

                              DOUG
                    Well then...to a night we'll never
                    forget.
          They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

          THE NEXT MORNING
          Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into

          

                                                                   14.

          

          

          THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE
          THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the
          totalled suite.
          Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is
          covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans,
          platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon
          Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc.
          SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe,
          the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.

          TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM"
          The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it
          reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path.
          Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu.
          The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all
          over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the
          couch, onto a pile of newspapers.

                              PILE OF NEWSPAPERS
                    OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!
          Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find
          Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick
          pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.

                              VICK
                    Damn, dude, why are you retarded?
          Both men are ragingly hungover.
          A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:

                                 VICK (CONT'D)
                    Um, Stuey?

                                 STU
                    Yo.

                              VICK
                    Why do you have a mullet?
          Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too
          hungover to understand.

                                 STU
                    What?

          

                                                                     15.

          

          

                              VICK
                    You know, business on top, party
                    down the back?
          Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.
          Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom.
          After a beat, we hear his voice:

                              STU (O.S.)
                    Dude...I have a mullet.
          Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:

                              ALAN (O.S.)
                    Just give me ten more minutes,
                    Beck...

                              STU (O.S.)
                    Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?
          Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Check it out: Alan slept in the
                    tub.

                              VICK
                    Get him up. I'm hungry.
          Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER
          turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:

                              ALAN (O.S.)
                    Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!
          There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat.
          Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan
          stumble out of the bathroom.
          Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night
          before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut
          off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.

                              VICK
                    Jesus, dude, put away your sack.
          Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.

          

                                                                    16.

          

          

                              STU
                    Yeah, and it might be time for some
                    manscaping, bro. Your bush looks
                    like Yanni.
          Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.

                              ALAN
                    What did we do last night?

                                                              CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          The guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments
          later. Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy.

                              STU
                    Dude, why is my ass killing me...?

          INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER

          Looking like crap, the guys silently descend in the elevator.
          BING! The elevator opens to expose a NICE-LOOKING COUPLE
          waiting to get on. They see the guys and immediately step
          away from the elevator.

                              MAN
                    We'll...we'll get the next one.
          The doors close. The guys continue to descend. Beat.

                              VICK
                    We might not smell very good.
          The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- BREAKFAST BUFFET -- DAY

          The guys slouch in a booth, shoveling masses of buffet food
          into their mouths, washing it down with huge mugs of coffee.

                              STU
                    This might be the worst hangover
                    anyone has ever had, ever.

                              ALAN
                    I can't taste anything.

          

                                                                  17.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Please stop talking. If I don't
                    focus on eating I'm going to throw
                    up all over myself.
          The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:

                              ALAN
                    Hey... Are we missing something?
          The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:

                              STU
                    Yes: I left my hat in the room --
                    thank you, Alan.
          They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.

                              ALAN
                    No. That's not it... There's
                    something else...
          Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.

                              VICK
                    You gonna finish that cruller?
          Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his
          already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:

                              ALAN
                    Doug. Guys, where's Doug?
          The guys look around. Hunh.

                              STU
                    Yeah. He's not here.

                              VICK
                    Probably left him in the room.
          Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    I'll call his cell.
          Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:

                              STU
                    Good morning, this is Stu?

                              VICK
                    It's me, meatdick.

          

                                                                     18.

          

          

                              STU
                        (to Alan, concerned)
                    It's Vick--
          Then Stu realizes. Oh.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    This is Doug's phone.
          Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.

                              ALAN
                    You calling the room?
          Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then
          he hangs up.

                                 VICK
                    No answer.
          Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.

                              ALAN
                    Ummm...shouldn't we look for him?
                    Check-out is in like ten minutes.

                              STU
                    Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have
                    Doug back to LA by five.
          Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:

                              VICK
                    I'm eabing.

                              ALAN
                    What an asshole. Stu, check the
                    pool and the casino, I'll check the
                    room and the gym. Maybe he's
                    working out or something...
          Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    And Vick, if you could keep a close
                    eye on the buffet, that'd be really
                    helpful. Thanks, man.
          Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:

                              VICK

                    HE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING!

          

                                                                  19.

          

          
          Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller.

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Alan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake.

                              ALAN
                    Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man.
          Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes
          him a second to realize what's wrong:

          THE BED IS MISSING
          There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay.
          Alan scratches his head.

                              ALAN
                    That's weird...

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAY

          Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright
          sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool.
          Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted!

                              STU
                    No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's
                    totally cool...

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. GYM -- DAY

          Alan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is
          packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself:

                              ALAN
                    I hate you all...

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTS

          Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud:

                              STU

                    DOUG! DOUG!
          Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.

          

                                                                  20.

          

          

                               GAY MAN
                    Hey Stu.

                              STU
                    Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--!
          Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns
          around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone.
          Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan
          talking to Atashir at

          THE RECEPTION DESK
          He slowly bow-legs himself over.

                              STU
                    You find Doug?

                              ALAN
                    No, I assume you didn't either?
          Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.

                              ATASHIR
                    There is no Doug Billings at any of
                    the area hospitals, morgues, or
                    police stations.
          The guys frown, starting to grow worried.

                              STU
                    Maybe he went for a jog?

                              ALAN
                    Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.

                              STU
                    Or shopping?
          The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.

                              ALAN
                    Great. So we've officially lost
                    Doug. His wedding is in what, 22
                    hours?

                              VICK
                    Relax, it's Doug, he's probably
                    crashed out on someone's couch
                    right now. All we have to do is
                    retrace our steps from last night,
                    and we'll find him.

          

                                                                  21.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Okay, so last night...
          The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.

                              VICK
                    Well, we started on the roof...

                              ALAN
                    Right, that was like, 6ish...?

                              VICK
                    Then...I think...we had steaks at
                    the Palm?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah. Then...we played craps at the
                    Hard Rock...maybe?

                              VICK
                    That sounds right...
          Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.

                              STU
                    Okay, honestly? I don't even
                    remember going to dinner.

                              VICK
                    I vaguely recall...doing body shots
                    ....at some point? Is that...maybe?

                               ALAN
                    I'm pretty much blank after The
                    Hard Rock.

                              VICK
                    I think we went to the Flamingo
                    after that...? And then, I just
                    remember a lot of blue light...and
                    the overpowering smell of baby oil.

                              ALAN
                    So that was what, 10ish?

                              VICK
                    Give or take.

                              STU
                    Was Doug still with us?
          Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.

          

                                                                  22.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I
                    tackled him...for some reason.
          The guys nod, okay, okay.

                              ALAN
                    Okay. So we only have a 13 hour
                    window where we could've lost him.
          They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets,
          thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook.
          He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub.

                              STU
                    Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.
          A long beat of silence...
          Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start
          emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before.
          They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...

                              ALAN
                    ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37--
                        (reading it)
                    For 600 dollars?!

                              VICK
                    The valet ticket says we returned
                    here at 4:57AM.

                              STU
                    We drove last night?
          The guys wince, jesus...

                              ALAN
                    Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The
                    meal was comped for some reason--

                              VICK
                    Why do we have a matchbook from The
                    Golden Pony All Male Revue?
          The guys exchange a look, alarmed.

                              ALAN
                    Someone could've given that to us.

          

                                                                    23.

          

          

                              STU
                        (laughing, nervous)
                    Yeah, totally! There's no way we
                    went there! We're not gay! Hahaha!
          They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the
          blackjack table.

                              ALAN
                    I think we should call Tracy.

                              VICK
                    Absolutely not.

                              ALAN
                    What if Doug called her? She might
                    know where he is.
          Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.

                              STU
                    Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.

                              VICK
                    Of course you're with Alan, you're
                    both gutless cowards. But we're not
                    calling Tracy. You never call the
                    bride from the bachelor party.
                    Ever. If my balls were on fire and
                    Tracy was sitting next door with a
                    tall glass of water, I still
                    wouldn't call her. It's a rule.

                              ALAN
                    But shouldn't we at least tell her
                    we're gonna be getting home late?

                              VICK
                    She has a watch, she'll figure it
                    out.

                              ALAN
                    I think I'm beginning to see why
                    you're always single.

                              VICK
                    And I think I'm beginning to see
                    why you're always a douche--

                              STU
                        (clutching his ass)
                    Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh
                    my God -- like right now. Come on.

          

                                                                    24.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, what is it?

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed
          men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans.

                              VICK
                    I can't believe we're doing this.

                              STU
                    You don't have to look up my butt,
                    just at it. Something is terribly,
                    terribly wrong...
          Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.

          
          He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I
          ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter.

                              ALAN
                    Sweet mother of mercy...

                              VICK
                    Who's Roger?

                              STU
                    I-I-I don't know?! What do you
                    think it means?!

                              VICK
                    What do I think it means? Well,
                    Stuart, your ass is all torn up and
                    you're wearing thong underwear
                    declaring your love for another
                    dude -- I don't think we need the
                    CSI team for this one! You got
                    reamed last night, man!
          Stu covers his mouth, horrified!

                              ALAN
                    I'm sure there's a perfectly
                    logical explanation for this...

                              STU
                    Really?! What?!
          Alan tries to think of one.

          

                                                           25.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, maybe there isn't.

                              VICK
                    Look, I'm sure Roger is a very
                    nice, considerate young man--

                              STU
                    Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!

                              VICK
                    Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near
                    cool enough.

                              STU
                        (gasping, realizing)
                    I do watch Dancing With The Stars
                    with the kids!

                              ALAN
                    Oh god, that doesn't mean you're
                    gay.

                              VICK
                    But sort of...it does?
          Stu grows increasingly frantic.

                              STU
                    And once, I caught myself gazing at
                    a topless photo of David Beckham!

                              ALAN
                    So what, he's a great-looking dude--

                              STU
                    And then I had those weird feelings
                    for Vick that time in middle
                    school, remember?!
          Everyone stops. Vick most of all.

                                VICK
                    Um, what?

                              STU
                    Yeah, that weekend we were all
                    camping -- I told you this.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, no you didn't.

                                STU
                    I didn't?

          

                                                                    26.

          

          

                              VICK
                    I think I'd remember, dude.

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, I think we'd all remember.

                               STU
                    Yeah. I had weird feelings for you
                    that weekend. Like really hot,
                    really gay feelings. But then they
                    went away.
          Vick is just looking at him, stunned.

                              ALAN
                    Wait -- I was there that weekend.
                    Did you have gay feelings for me?

                              VICK
                    Unbelievable.

                              ALAN
                    What?! I was a good-looking kid!

                              VICK
                    Please, you're so not his type!

                              STU
                    Wait, what?
          Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room
          and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string...

                              VICK
                    Look, Stu, one homosexual
                    experience doesn't mean you're
                    permanently gay, okay? A lot of
                    guys test the waters.
          ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.

                              ALAN
                    All right, we're scaring the
                    children. Let's go.
          The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.

                              STU
                    Wait -- so have either of you
                    tested the waters?

                              VICK
                    No! We're not gay!

          

                                                                  27.

          

          
          Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto

          THE CASINO FLOOR
          The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit.
          Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.

                              STU
                    How am I going to tell my wife?

                              VICK
                    Quickly, and from a great distance.
          Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS...

                              STU
                    Jesus, what kind of father am I?
          Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time
          it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold.

                                 ALAN
                    Oh my God.

                              STU
                        (really scared)
                    You think Erin will try to take the
                    kids--?

                              ALAN
                    Oh...my...God.

                              VICK
                        (turning, annoyed)
                    What now?
          Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger
          is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it.

                              STU
                        (not getting it)
                    Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna
                    have a field day with this.
          Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and
          starts back towards Alan.

                              VICK
                    Oh my God... Oh my God...

                              STU
                    What's the big--?
                        (finally realizing)
                    Oh! OH! OH!

          

                                                                   28.

          

          
          Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily
          takes off the massive unicorn ring.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Maybe it's not a wedding ring?

                              ALAN
                        (reading inscription)
                    "To My Noble Husband, Alan."
          The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!

                              STU
                    This is worse than my underwear!
          Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:

                              VICK
                    "Now & Forever Wedding Chapel."
          They guys exchange a look.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Well, at least it's a lead.
          Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot
          machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over,
          disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET STAND -- DAY

          The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands
          his ticket to the valet. Alan chews mint gum.

                              VICK
                    So, we go to the wedding chapel, we
                    find out what we did with Doug, we
                    recover him, and we're back in LA
                    before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.
          No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.

                              STU
                    Check it out, some idiot threw his
                    bed out the window last night.
          Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel
          with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.

                              ALAN
                    That was us, dude.

          

                                                                    29.

          

          

                              STU
                    Really?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's
                    room.

                               STU

                        (FROWNING)
                    Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good
                    reason for doing it.

                        (BEAT)
                    You think they'll charge us for--?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, Stu, I really do.

                              VICK
                    Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be
                    cool...
          Just then the Valet drives up in

          VICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC
          The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off-
          roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side
          door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood.
          The guys just stand there, agape.

                              STU
                    You okay, Vick?

                               VICK
                    I'm not emotionally prepared to
                    talk about it just yet, Stuart, but
                    thank you.
          Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          THE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP
          in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS,
          even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each
          quietly suffering in their own personal Hell.

                              ALAN
                    Seriously: what am I gonna tell
                    Becky? For 14 years she's been
                    begging me to get married...

          

                                                                    30.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Well, now you did. Just not to her.
          Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--

                              ALAN
                    Wait, is that homeless guy wearing
                    Doug's shirt?
          The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk
          in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before.
          Once they pass, the guys exchange a look.

                                 STU
                    Naaah.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that was a different shirt.
          Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:

                                 VICK (CONT'D)
                    Left turn.
          Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so
          as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...

          EXT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY

          Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a
          laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding
          Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front.

          INT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY

          Everything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white
          plastic. White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white
          plastic chairs. The guys enter.

                              ALAN
                    What if they don't remember us--?

                                 VOICE BEHIND THEM

                    AAAAYYYYY!
          The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE
          GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread
          wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.

                              STEVE
                    How are you, you dumb bastards?!

          

                                                                  31.

          

          
          He warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it
          shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...

                              STEVE (CONT'D)

                    CARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE!

                    ALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE!
                        (to the guys)
                    You here to pick up your wedding
                    photos?!
          Alan starts to decline, when--

                              VICK
                    Does the pope wear a funny hat?!
                    Let's do this thing!
          Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.

                              STEVE
                    And where is Chastity today?
          They all sit on white plastic chairs.

                              ALAN
                    W-Who's...Chastity?

                              STEVE

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just
                    breaking my balls!
          Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts
          laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick
          eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.

                               VICK
                    Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony,
                    wasn't it?

                              STEVE
                    Hand to God, I've never seen two
                    people more in love!

                              VICK
                    Sadly, I believe you...
          The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night
          before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all
          wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor.
          They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk.
          The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's
          having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.

          

                                                                  32.

          

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Hello, Chastity...
          Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.

                              ALAN
                    I am never...ever...drinking again.

                              STU
                    Jesus, she is stacked.

                              VICK
                    Stu, please, show some class.
                    That's Alan's wife you're talking
                    about.

                              STU
                        (to Alan, guilty)
                    Sorry. She looks really nice.
          But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and
          Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel. (It is, of course, a
          rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.)

                              ALAN
                    We got a unicorn?!

                              STEVE
                    Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double
                    Camelot Package.
          Alan just rubs his temples, oh no.

                              ALAN
                    A-And how much did that cost?

                              STEVE
                    7 thousand dollars.
          Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!

                              STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, you didn't want to get it,
                    either, but Vick insisted.
          Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!

                              ALAN
                    I'm gonna kill you!

                              VICK
                        (fending him off)
                    You can't put a pricetag on love,
                    Alan! OW! You just can't!

          

                                                                    33.

          

          
          Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick.

                    STOP FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY!
          The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA,
          40's, enters. She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and
          dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then she grins:

                              CARLA
                    Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts!
          She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.

                              CARLA (CONT'D)
                    Good to see you, you stupid mooks!
          Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick,
          on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly.

                              VICK
                    It's good to be seen, Carla. It's
                    good to be seen.

                              CARLA
                    I brought the rest of your package.
          Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes.

                              CARLA (CONT'D)
                    First: Two dozen commuter mugs...
          She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo
          emblazoned on them. Alan winces, oh god. Stu grabs one:

                              STU
                    No way! Awesome!

                              STEVE
                    A hundred DVDs of the ceremony...
          She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:

                              VICK
                    For you and Chastity to watch on
                    your anniversary...
          Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.

                              CARLA
                    The velvet wall hanging...
          She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of
          Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space.

          

                                                                    34.

          

          

                              VICK
                    And it looks like real velvet,
                    Alan, so no machine wash, okay?

                              CARLA
                    And the big finish:
          Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited...
          Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas-
          relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it. Alan just
          closes his eyes.

                                 STU

                    HOLY CRAP!

                              VICK

                    DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD!

                              STU
                    I want a shield!

                              VICK
                    Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a
                    shield?

                              ALAN
                    I don't suppose you have any sort
                    of return policy, do you?

                              STEVE
                    Um...if you know another couple who
                    looks exactly like you guys, and
                    who want two dozen commuter mugs, a
                    wall hanging, and a shield...sure.
          Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it
          without looking at the Caller ID.

                                 ALAN
                    What.
          We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hey Becky! Hi!
          He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:

                              VICK
                    That's his girlfriend of 14 years.
                    I'm sure this'll only take a
                    minute...

          

                                                                  35.

          

          
          Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan
          tries to talk to his furious girlfriend.

          INTERCUT WITH:

          BECKY
          in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase.
          She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set.

                              BECKY
                    Can you tell me why all the goddamn
                    credit cards are maxed out?!

                              ALAN
                    No! I-I have no idea--!
          Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:

                              VICK

                    HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR

                    BEST MAN, DUDE!

                              STU

                    YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER!

                    WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!
          Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard.

                              BECKY
                    "Your best man?!" What's going on
                    there, Alan?!

                              ALAN
                    Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS

                    ARE JUST BEING DICKS!

                              VICK

                    HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET-

                    SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I

                    BOGART A FEW?!
          Alan furiously flips them off, shut up!

                              BECKY
                    I really don't appreciate being
                    mocked right now, Alan, especially
                    about wedding-related issues. You
                    know how hard this weekend is going
                    to be for me.

                              ALAN
                    I know, baby! I know--

          

                                                                  36.

          

          

                              BECKY
                    So you'll call the credit card
                    company and straighten this out?

                              ALAN
                    Yes. I will. I promise.

                              BECKY
                    Okay. Okay...
                        (beat, calming)
                    Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll
                    see you soon, okay? Love you.
          But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making
          out with his blonde bombshell wife...

                              BECKY (CONT'D)
                    Alan? Hello? I said I love you?!

                              ALAN
                    Yes, no, I love you too!
          Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable.
          STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales.

                              STU
                    Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, did she ask about us?!
          Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we

                                                            CUT TO:

          STEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP
          through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan
          sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD.

                              STU
                    Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick
                    found a great clue.

                              VICK
                    Turns out Doug was in all the
                    wedding photos, which means -- if
                    the time stamp was right -- we had
                    him in our possession until 11 pm.

          

                                                                  37.

          

          

                              STU
                    That's another hour of last night
                    that we can account for. Isn't that
                    great?

                              ALAN
                        (bitterly sarcastic)
                    Amazing.

                              VICK
                    Hey, Steve, you don't happen to
                    know where we were heading when we
                    left here last night, do you?

                              STEVE
                    Well, the Double Camelot Package
                    comes with a five course wedding
                    feast, so I assume you went there.

                              STU
                    Great -- where was the feast?

                              STEVE
                    Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.

                                                            CUT TO:

                              ALAN (V.O.)
                    I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

          The beatup Caddy is packed with wedding crap. Vick is busy
          trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot.
          Stu's in the backseat with the huge shield, while Alan
          seethes up front.

                              VICK
                    Your negativity is like a little
                    black cloud over our car, Alan.
                    You've got to let go of this.

                              ALAN
                    Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The
                    fact that I married a complete
                    stranger last night? Or that my
                    girlfriend's about to leave me? Or
                    that I'm broke? Which one?!

                              VICK
                    You're broke? I thought you were

                    LOADED--

          

                                                                  38.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    I know you think it's like
                    terminally uncool to be in a
                    committed relationship, Vick, but I
                    actually love Becky, okay?

                        (SINCERE)
                    I-I honestly don't know what I'd do
                    without her...I really don't...
          Alan looks off, lost, sick. Vick stops the car short.

                              VICK
                    Alan. Honey. Have you considered,
                    even for a second, that maybe the
                    things we do when we're drunk are
                    what we secretly want to do?

                              ALAN
                        (dripping with sarcasm)
                    Yeah, no, you're absolutely right,
                    Vick, I've always secretly wanted
                    to marry a bottle blonde with big
                    fake melon tits named Chastity!

                              STU
                    I ain't mad atcha, dude...

                               VICK
                    Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't
                    have the balls to leave Becky, and
                    this is your way of getting her to
                    leave you.

                              ALAN
                    I was going to propose to her this
                    weekend, you jackass!

                              VICK
                    All the more reason to freak out.
          Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick
          nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but
                    you've always had a major pole up
                    your ass. Maybe last night was your
                    inner cool person trying to get out-

                              ALAN
                    I swear to God, Vick, if you say
                    one more word to me, I will destroy
                    you.

          

                                                                  39.

          

          

                              STU
                    Guys, come on, let's not use our
                    angry words--

          SMASH!
          A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump!
          Vick slams on the brakes!

                              VICK
                    What the--?!
          They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian
          shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on
          either side of the car. And they look pissed.

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    Get out of the car, Vick.
          Stu and Alan recoil in terror.

                              STU
                    Who are these guys?!

                              VICK
                    Stu, please.
                        (to Kalolo Fanalua)
                    I think there's been some sort of
                    mistake, Mister...?

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    I'm Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get
                    The Hell Outta The Car, and this is
                    my associate, Mr. Smash You In The
                    Teeth If You Say Another Word.

                              VICK
                        (beat, to Alan)
                    Those so aren't their real names.

                              ALAN
                    Vick, don't be a dick--!

                              VICK
                    Alan? Relax. These men aren't going
                    to hurt us. They're from Hawaii.

          SMASH! SMASH! SMASH!
          Kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car!

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    We're from Guam, bitch! Now get
                    outta the car!

          

                                                                    40.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat!
                    Jesus, why is everyone trying to
                    kill my car...?
          Vick undoes his seatbelt   and reaches for his door handle.
          Kikiolani lowers his bat   -- and Vick throws the door open,
          right into his nuts! The   huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and
          Vick slams his door shut   and

          FLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE!
          The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the
          street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out
          of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement...

          EXT. EAST VEGAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS

          Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge
          SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out.

                              ALAN
                    Why'd you do that?!

                              VICK

                        (INCREDULOUS)
                    Really?

                              STU
                    Maybe they just wanted to talk!

                              VICK
                    I honestly don't know how you two
                    are still alive.

                              ALAN
                    Do you think we stole something
                    from them last night?!

                              STU
                    Oh my god I am such a bad dad!

                              ALAN
                        (producing cellphone)
                    I'm calling the police. This is
                    getting way out of control--

                              VICK
                    No! No cops!

                              ALAN
                    "No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty
                    Cent?!

          

                                                                  41.

          

          

                              STU
                    Yeah, Vick, what's going on?

                              VICK
                    Nothing! I just think we should
                    focus on finding Doug and not get
                    distracted by every little thing!

                              ALAN
                    Every little thing?! We were just
                    assaulted by the Yakuza!

                              VICK
                    Oh please, those guys are from
                    Guam. Get a grip.

                              ALAN
                    They knew your name, Vick! Which
                    means they probably know who Stu
                    and I are, too!

                              STU
                    If anything ever happened to my
                    family, Vick...

                              VICK
                    Fine. Let's just go back to the
                    hotel -- Doug is probably back from
                    wherever he spent the night, we'll
                    get him, we'll straighten out
                    whatever we did to those angry
                    Samoans, then we'll get the hell
                    back to LA, okay? Left turn.
          Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan
          hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car.

                                                            CUT TO:

          TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 2:26 PM"

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- DAY

          The boys hurry into their room, stressed.

                              VICK
                    Doug? Doug?
          Alan quickly checks the room phone.

                              ALAN
                    No messages.

          

                                                                  42.

          

          

                              STU
                    Come on, let's toss the place.
          Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while
          Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms...

          INT. BEDROOM

          Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes,
          looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on
          the ground. Picks it up.

                              STU
                    Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested
                    30 grand in your custard store last
                    night!
          Vick calls from the other bedroom.

                              VICK (O.S.)
                    Smart move, man.
          Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes.

                              STU
                    Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?!
          Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the
          closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring
          away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face.

                              VICK
                    Whoa.

                              STU
                    You think she's what those Guamian
                    dudes wanted?

                              VICK
                    No. I think she's Alan's wife.
          Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet-
          sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy?
          A second later Alan enters, what's up?

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan.
          Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor,
          her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What...what am I supposed to do?

                              STU
                    Wake her up, man!

                               ALAN
                    Why me?!

                              VICK
                    Because she's your spouse, dude!
          Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared,
          he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Pinch her tit. It always works.
          Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets
          out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up,
          terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented.

                              CHASTITY
                    Dang, did I sleep in the closet
                    again...?
          Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles,
          recognizing them:

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Oh hey, guys! What's up?
          She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a
          snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face.
          The guys have no idea what to say. She kisses Alan on the
          cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Morning, honey...
          She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie.
          Beat. Alan is speechless.

                              STU
                    She seems really cool.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, I really like her, man.

          

                                                                  44.

          

          

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- LIVING ROOM

          Chastity gathers her belongings -- jacket, purse, G string --
          from around the totalled living room. The guys file in.

                              VICK
                    So, um, did you take Alan's name?

                              STU
                    Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish
                    now--?

                              ALAN
                    Listen to me. Just...did we, or did
                    we not, have sex last night?
          Alan braces, please say no, please say no...
          Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes...

                                 CHASTITY
                    Well...ya?
          Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    But we waited til we were married.
          Alan GROANS.

                              VICK
                    What a responsible, upstanding
                    young Jew. They don't make `em like
                    that anymore, am I right?
          Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.

                              CHASTITY
                    I know -- he even wanted to use a
                    rubber.
          Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT.

                              ALAN
                    Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!

                              CHASTITY
                    It's cool, I sponge.
          Alan leans against a wall, dizzy.

                              ALAN
                    Can someone...please open a window?

          

                                                                 45.

          

          
          Stu turns and tries to open a window. No luck.

                              STU
                    They don't open.

                              CHASTITY
                    So you guys don't remember any of
                    last night?

                              VICK
                    Yeah, not so much.

                              CHASTITY
                    Hey, been there before, right?
                        (grabbing her sizable bra)
                    Sucks, though. The wedding was
                    really fun. I'm bummed you don't
                    remember it, Alan.
          She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan:

                              STU
                    Dude, I think your wife's mad at
                    you.

                              VICK
                    You don't happen to remember what
                    time we met you last night, do you?

                              CHASTITY
                    Sure, we met at the bar at like
                    10:00? Then we got married on my
                    smoke break, which was like 11:00?

                              VICK
                    It's the All-American love story,
                    isn't it? What happened next?

                              CHASTITY
                    Well, I had to go back to work. But
                    when I got off at 5:30, I met up
                    with you guys back here.

                              VICK
                    And was Doug with us then?

                              CHASTITY
                    No.

                              VICK
                    Interesting... Do you have any idea
                    where we went after the wedding?

          

                                                                      46.

          

          

                                CHASTITY
                      No, but I bet some of my work
                      friends do. You were partying with
                      them pretty hard.

                                STU
                      Work friends?

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

          STRIPPERS
          Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles.

          INT. CRAZY HORSE GENTLEMEN'S CLUB -- DAY

          Chastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip
          Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete
          with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages
          of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS.
          Alan follows after Chastity, horrified.

                                ALAN
                      You work here?
          Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.

                                CHASTITY
                      Yeah -- and this is the pole where
                      we first met!
          She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER
          currently spins. Alan looks ill.

                                CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                      It's always been my lucky pole...

                                ALAN
                      Look, I don't know how to tell you
                      this, but--

                                CHASTITY

                      HEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT!
          She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING
          to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole.

                                PLATINUM THE STRIPPER
                      Get it, girl!

                                CHASTITY
                      Come on, let's go meet my
                      bridesmaids!

          

                                                                  47.

          

          
          She hurries off, but Alan can't move.

                              STU
                    Dude.

                              VICK
                    I know.

                              ALAN
                    The Holocaust, man.
          Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder.

                              VICK
                    Look, we can get your grandmother's
                    ring back. We just gotta go about
                    it in the right way.

                              ALAN
                    I have besmirched my people.

                              STU
                    Don't be so hard on yourself, dude--
          Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS.

                              CHASTITY
                    These were my bridesmaids,
                    Anastasia and Starr!

                              STARR
                    Hey, boys! Good to see you again!

                              ANASTASIA
                    Mazel Tov--!

                              ALAN
                    Please...don't.
          Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY
          PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system:

                              STRIP CLUB D.J.

                    OKAY, GUYS! LET'S GIVE A CRAZY

                    HORSE SHOUT-OUT TO OUR HAPPY NEW

                    COUPLE, CHASTITY AND ALANNNN!
          The entire club CHEERS! Chastity holds up her wedding ring
          and dances around, WOO HOO! Alan waves meekly. Thanks.

                              STRIPPER D.J.

                    IN HONOR OF THEIR MARRIAGE, WE'RE

                    DOING TWO-FOR-ONE LAPDANCES! TWO

                    SONGS FOR TWENTY BUCKS!

          

                                                                  48.

          

          
          The DJ puts on Nine Inch Nails' "I Want to Fuck You Like An
          Animal" and the club gets hopping again.

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh my God, he's playing our song!
                        (giddy, to Alan)
                    This song was playing when we met,
                    remember?! You kept sliding
                    twenties into my thong and saying
                    "I will always love you. I will
                    always love you."
          Alan closes his eyes.

                                ALAN
                    Twenties?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah, it was so sweet...

                              ALAN
                    Look, I don't know how to say this,
                    but my friends and I were very
                    drunk last night. We would never
                    come to a place like this--
          He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone.

                                ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Guys?

                                                            CUT TO:

          VICK AND STU TOASTING SHOTS OF JAGERMEISTER
          and downing them. PULL BACK to see that they are sitting in

          THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM
          getting lapdances from STARR and ANASTASIA. The Champagne
          Room is a dark, plush private suite in the back of the Crazy
          Horse where strippers ply their craft; the room is half full.
          Vick watches Starr lean over and make out with Anastasia.

                              VICK
                    You are the best bridesmaids ever.

                              STU
                        (huge boobs in his face)
                    Dude: I might not be gay.
          Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed.

          

                                                          49.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What the hell are you doing?!

                              VICK
                    Two-for-ones, man.

                              ALAN
                    We don't have time for this! We
                    gotta find Doug!

                              VICK
                    What do you think we're doing?

                              ALAN
                    What?

                              VICK
                    We're getting into the mindset of
                    last night, to see if it sparks any
                    memories.
                        (to his stripper)
                    Now: is this exactly how you were
                    dancing for me last night, Starr?
          She nods. Vick nods, pensive, scientific.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, still no memories. Keep going
                    -- and put your back into it.

                              ALAN
                    You are so goddamn selfish, Vick.
                    You really are. Stu, let's go.

                              VICK
                    No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance.
          Stu looks between them, torn.

                              ALAN
                    Dude: Doug is missing! We have less
                    than 18 hours til his wedding! We
                    do not have time for this!

                              VICK
                    I'm trying to save your life here,
                    Alan Mervish.

                              ALAN
                    Vick--!

          

                                                                    50.

          

          

                              VICK
                    I'm not kidding, man! Life is one
                    long series of emergencies, and if
                    you don't learn to stop and have a
                    little fun along the way, you're
                    gonna grow into a joyless old prick
                    like your dad. I'm sorry to bring
                    Moshe Mervish into it, but it had
                    to be said. Now yes, we have 18
                    hours to find Doug -- which means
                    we can afford to spend ten minutes
                    celebrating the special talents of
                    these gifted young body-artists. So
                    sit down, have a jager shot, and
                    smell the goddamn roses for once in
                    your miserable life. Chastity,
                    honey? When you're ready?
          Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and
          starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:

                              ALAN
                    No, look-- I am like totally
                    against this, morally and
                    politically. Plus Becky
                    specifically asked me not to--

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

          ALAN SITTING ON THE BANQUETTE, LOOKING AWESTRUCK
          as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him. She crawls
          onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her
          tongue in his ear. Next to him, no longer getting lapdances,
          Vick and Stu just sit, staring at Chastity, entranced.

                              STU
                    I think I know why he married her.

                              VICK
                    Because if he hadn't, I would've.
          They continue watching on in silence.

                              STU
                    Is it weird that we're sitting this
                    close watching?

                              VICK
                    Not for me.
          More watching in silence.

          

                                                                     51.

          

          

                               STU
                    I really shouldn't be here. I have
                    daughters.
          Then both of their heads angle the same way.

                              VICK
                    Not that can do that.

                              STU
                    How can she do that without
                    dislocating her hip?

                              VICK
                    Because she's been touched by God.
          They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked
          open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the
          Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our
          guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately.

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    Shit.
          They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized
          by Chastity. Vick grabs him.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!

                              ALAN
                    Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses--
          Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.

                              VICK
                    Come on, man! We got company!
          Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Chastity, honey, is there a back
                    way out of here?!
          Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to
          a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR.

                               CHASTITY
                    Come on!
          The guys race after her...

          

                                                                    52.

          

          

          INT. CRAZY HORSE -- BACK HALLWAY

          Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back
          hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers,
          cocktail waitresses, and barbacks.
          Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are
          slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're
          bowled over by the obese Islanders.

          INT. CRAZY HORSE -- MAIN STAGE

          A spotlight holds on a CLOSED CURTAIN covering the main
          stage. Some sort of techno Limp Bizkit song is playing.

                              STRIPPER D.J. (O.S.)

                    ANNND ON STAGE ONE, PUT YOUR HANDS

                    TOGETHER FOR...DOUBLE STAXXX!
          All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu
          blows through the curtain, out of breath. Beat. The patrons
          look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them, equally so.
          The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan
          blow through the curtain after Stu.

                               CHASTITY
                    Come on!
          Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main
          runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits
          the floor running!

                              STU
                    Did she just do that in heels?!

                              VICK
                    I'm really starting to like this
                    girl.
          The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and
          leaping over the patrons!
          Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very
          upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the
          end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.

          CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB
          Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again,
          leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and,
          finally, sprinting out the front door!

          

                                                                  53.

          

          
          The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of
          destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through
          a forest. Just as they're blowing out of the door, however,

          THEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS
          being swung into their chests! SMASH! They both stumble
          backwards, and then four roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS
          pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground.

                              CRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD
                        (to walkie talkie)
                    Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder,
                    we've subdued the targets, over.

          EXT. CRAZY HORSE -- DAY

          Chastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the Crazy
          Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase.

                              STU
                    Did you see them trample those tiny
                    Japanese businessmen?! I think they
                    killed like four of them!
          Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.

                              VICK
                    Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't
                    just a little fun...

                              ALAN
                    That was...a little fun.
          Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb,
          lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get
          out and hurry for them, pointing, intense.

                    Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?!
                    Stuart Pryce?!

                        (SCARED)
                    Y-Yes?!

                              LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN
                    You're coming with us.

          INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

          The two LVPD cops, OFFICER MERRIWEATHER and OFFICER BLADEN,
          40's, pace about this bare interrogation room, while Vick,
          Alan and Stu sit behind the cold metal table.
          Vick looks tense, but in control. Stu and Alan are sweating,
          terrified. They've clearly been here a while.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    Where were you last night at 3am?

                               VICK
                    No idea.

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Okay, how about at 2am?

                               VICK
                    Ditto.
          Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    You think this is cute, son?! You
                    think this is a game?!

                              ALAN
                    Whatever we did, we're so sorry!

                              STU
                    Honestly, man, I will confess to
                    anything you want!

                               VICK
                    Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up
                    straight. Officer Merriweather,
                    I've told you twelve times now: we
                    have no memory of last night. Now
                    either charge us with a crime, or
                    let us go.
          Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a
          TELEVISION and turns it on. Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls
          out a photograph of a slick ASIAN MAN in a red suit, slides
          it onto the table.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    What do you know about Jimmy Lang?
          Vick flinches ever-so-slightly, clearly knowing something.
          Stu and Alan just look at the photograph, confused.

          

                                                                    55.

          

          

                                  ALAN
                     Nothing?

                                  STU
                     Who is he?

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                     Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang-
                     Xi crime organization, and is
                     wanted in seven states for money
                     laundering, drug smuggling,
                     racketeering and murder.

                               ALAN
                     Oh my god--

                               STU
                     Did we kill someone last night--?!

                               VICK
                     We have no idea who this man is.

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                     Is that right?

                               VICK
                     Yeah, that's right.
          ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a
          birthday party starts playing. In the video, JIMMY LANG sits
          in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a
          table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with "Happy
          Birthday To You."
          When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him
          blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's
          Vick, ALAN, STU, DOUG, and some BLACK GUY, all very drunk!

                               VICK & ALAN & STU & DOUG (ON TAPE)

                     HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR JIMMMMY, HAPPY

                     BIRTHDAY TOOO YOOOOU!
          Everyone applauds. Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.

                               VICK (ON TAPE)
                     I love you, Jimmy Lang!
          Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy
          Lang's shaved head.
          In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen.
          Silence.

          

                                                          56.

          

          

                              STU
                    We're in a lot of trouble, aren't
                    we.

                              ALAN
                    Officers, I swear, we have no
                    memory of that ever occurring--

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Okay. Maybe a night in jail will
                    jostle something loose.

                              STU
                    Oh no, sir, please don't!

                              ALAN
                    We have a very important wedding--!

                              VICK
                    I know Jimmy Lang.
          Everyone stops, looks at Vick.

                               ALAN
                    You do?!

                              VICK
                    Jimmy and I tried to raise capital
                    for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness
                    center and day spa for tween-age
                    girls, but it never got off the
                    ground. It was an entirely
                    legitimate enterprise -- I had no
                    idea he was a criminal. We must've
                    bumped into him last night, and he
                    must've invited us to join his
                    birthday celebration. No crime in
                    that, is there, Officers?
          Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense.

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    You actually expect me to believe
                    that dung?

                              VICK

                        (UNBLINKING)
                    Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    If I find out you're lying to me,
                    son, I will take all of you down,
                    is that clear?

          

                                                                     57.

          

          

                               OFFICER BLADEN
                    You boys wouldn't last three hours
                    in prison.

                                 VICK
                    Stu might.
          Stu shakes his head, unbelievable.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Now: are you gonna charge us with
                    something, or are we free to go?
          The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat.

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Get outta here.
          Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door.

                              ALAN
                    Oh, thank you, Officers!

                              STU
                    It was really nice meeting you--!

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    If you know what's good for you,
                    you'll get the hell out of Vegas.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

          Day has turned to night. Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the
          steps of the police station. The mood is grim.

                              ALAN
                    Did you have to be such a dick?!

                              VICK
                    We got out, didn't we?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, four hours later! If we'd
                    just cooperated with them--

                              VICK
                    If we'd cooperated with them, we'd
                    be in jail right now, Alan.
          They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab.
          Desperation is setting in.

          

                                                          58.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What are we gonna do now? We've got
                    zero leads on where Doug is!

                              STU
                    Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30.
          The guys shake their heads, I don't know.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Do you think he's okay--?

                              VICK
                    Stu, don't. Doug is fine.

                              STU
                    I mean, we were hanging out with
                    mobsters last night, man! They kill
                    people for looking at `em weird--!

                              VICK
                    Stu: Doug is fine.

                              STU
                    Or what if we like drove Doug out
                    to the desert and left him, just as
                    like a funny prank--?!

                              VICK
                    Stu! Enough!

                              ALAN

                        (MUTTERING)
                    I knew I shouldn't have come...

                              VICK
                    What did you just say?

                              ALAN
                    I said I knew I shouldn't have come
                    this weekend, Vick!

                              VICK
                        (getting heated)
                    Is that right?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, that's right. I only came
                    because Doug insisted.
          Vick steps towards Alan, heated.

          

                                                          59.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Why do think you're so much better
                    than us, dude?!

                              ALAN
                    I don't -- I just think I'm better
                    than you, Vick! And trust me, it's
                    not that hard! You haven't changed
                    one bit since high school! Jesus,
                    you're 28 years old and you still
                    talk back to cops?! Really?!

                              VICK
                    You're out of your depth, Alan--

                              ALAN
                    And you're still the one getting us
                    in trouble! Only then it was hiding
                    your weed in our locker, and now
                    you've got us partying with wanted
                    felons! It's not cute anymore, man!
                    We're too old for this!
          Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    And all your stupid get-rich-quick
                    schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?!
                    In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!

                              STU
                    Okay, let's all take a breath--

                              ALAN
                    When's the last time you had a real
                    job, man?! When's the last time you
                    had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the
                    last time you picked up the check?!

                              VICK
                    What's so great about any of those
                    things?!

                              ALAN
                    Those "things," Vick, are what
                    grown men do!
          Vick swallows, furious.

                              STU
                    Look, we're all tired and hungry--

          

                                                                    60.

          

          

                              VICK
                    None of us ever liked you, Alan! We
                    only hung out with you because Doug
                    made us!
          Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him.

                              ALAN
                    Stu...? Is that true?
          Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I
          see, his face reddening.

                              VICK
                    Why would anyone like you, dude?
                    Have you ever thought about that?
                    You're uptight, you're judgemental,
                    you're cheap, and yet somehow you
                    think you're sweeter than everyone
                    else! Well look around, man: no one
                    wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu
                    than you!

                              STU
                    Wait, what--?
          Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn!
          They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it
          ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in
          each other's faces...

                              ALAN
                    I've...always...hated you...

                              VICK
                    You punch like...your sister...
          Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.

                              STU
                    Hey, no! Time out! We all need a
                    time out--!
          THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down.
          Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat
          the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then,
          just when it starts getting way too intense,

          A CAR HORN SOUNDS
          And all three of them look up to see Vick'S BEAT-UP CADILLAC
          parked on the curb, Chastity at the wheel.

          

                                                                   61.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    That might not be like, the
                    smartest place to fight?
          Vick and Alan look over at the huge LAS VEGAS POLICE
          DEPARTMENT sign right next to them. They frown...

                                                              CUT TO:

          EXT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          Vick's car sits parked in front of a country bar.

          INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          The guys sit at a booth, their hair a mess, their faces
          bruised, their clothing ripped, ravenously chowing down on
          TACOS. Stu's mouth is full of food:

                              STU
                    Good call on happy hour, Chastity.
                    These tacos kick ass.

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah, I always come here when I get
                    out of jail.
          The guys exchange a quick look.

                              ALAN
                    Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car?

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh, my daddy taught me how to
                    hotwire almost anything.

                              VICK
                    That's funny, because Alan's daddy
                    taught him tax law.
          Chastity smiles, a little confused. Alan is quick to retort:

                              ALAN
                    And Vick's daddy taught him how to
                    get really drunk at his kid's
                    soccer games and then piss himself.

                              VICK
                    It's a disease, dude--!

                              STU
                    Guys, come on! For Doug?

          

                                                                  62.

          

          
          Alan and Vick angrily continue eating their tacos. Then Stu's
          PHONE rings. He pulls it out, reads the caller ID.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    "Number blocked."

                      VINCE                             ALAN               
          Don't answer it.                 Answer it.

                              ALAN
                    What if it's Doug?

                              VICK
                    What if it's Tracy?!

                              STU
                        (torn, answers phone)
                    Good evening, this is Stu!

          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

          It's Tracy. She's sitting in her living room, on the phone.
          Her STERN FATHER sits nearby, as do other FAMILY MEMBERS.

                              TRACY
                    Stu, it's Tracy!
          His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses:

                              STU
                    It's Tracy!
          Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Why is she calling me?!

                              VICK
                    Because she knows you're the most
                    easily tricked.

                              ALAN
                    We have tell her we lost Doug.

                              VICK
                    No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu!
          Stu turns back to the phone, rattled.

                              STU
                    Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?

          

                                                63.

          

          

                    TRACY
          Oh, nothing, just here with my
          family...

                    STU
          Wow, that sounds amazing!

                    TRACY
          Yeah...? Hey, you wouldn't happen
          to know where Doug is, would you?
          He said he'd be home by 5 for this
          dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I
          tried his cell, but he didn't
          answer...

                    STU
          Ummmm........Hang on.
              (covering the mouthpiece)
          She wants to know where Doug is!

                    VICK
          I'm working on it! Buy us some
          time!

                    ALAN
          No, just tell her the truth!
          Honesty is always the best policy!

                    VICK
          What are you, retarded?! Honesty is
          never the best policy! Especially
          not with brides!

                    STU
              (lamely, to phone)
          Um, what'd you say?

                    TRACY

              (FROWNING)
          I asked if you knew where Doug was.

                    STU
          Yeah, um, hang on.
              (to guys)
          She still wants to know!

                    VICK
          Okay: tell her Alan got really
          drunk last night and fell down, and
          the doctor said not to move him for
          a few hours, but that we'll be back
          in time for the wedding.

          

                                                            64.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Why do I have to be the one that
                    fell over drunk?!

                              VICK
                    It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get
                    over yourself! Stu: tell her!

                              STU (TO PHONE)
                    Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a

                    DOCTOR--

                              VICK
                    Fell over drunk.

                              STU
                    H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a
                    different doctor, not the one he
                    fell on -- he said we couldn't move
                    him until the wedding--

                              VICK
                    For a few hours! We'll be home
                    before the wedding!

                              STU
                    But we're going to have the wedding
                    at your home--
          Tracy just looks really confused.
          Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu.

                              VICK
                    Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?

                              TRACY
                        (now very concerned)
                    Vick, what is going on?

                              VICK
                    Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen,
                    Alan hurt his back last night, so
                    we're gonna be laid up here for a
                    bit, but I promise we'll have Doug
                    home in time for the wedding, okay?

                              TRACY
                    Oh God, is Alan all right?

          

                                                                  65.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Yes, luckily he had a steel rod
                    surgically implanted up his ass at
                    birth, so the doctors anticipate a
                    complete and swift recovery.
          Alan flips him the bird.

                              TRACY
                    Can I talk to Doug?

                              VICK
                    What? No! No, you can't actually,
                    Doug...Doug is out.

                              TRACY
                    Where is he?

                              VICK
                    Where is he? He's aaaat...the
                    pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's
                    medications. Listen, Trace, I'm
                    losing you, but we'll see you
                    tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie--!
          Vick hangs up and nods confidently.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    She bought it.

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

          Back in her bungalow, Tracy hangs up the phone, frowning.

                              TRACY
                    They've done something stupid.
          Her stern father is standing there, frowning.

                              MR. TURNER
                    No surprise there.

                              TRACY

                    DAD--

                              MR. TURNER
                    I'm just saying, what kind of man
                    stands up his fiancée the night
                    before their wedding?

          

                                                                   66.

          

          

                              TRACY
                    Dad, I don't want to hear it. I
                    trust Doug absolutely.
          Mr. Turner backs off. Tracy, however, looks a bit rattled...

                                                         CUT BACK TO:

          INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          The guys get up from the booth and head for the door, grim.

                              ALAN
                    Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd
                    have Doug home in 13 hours, and we
                    still have no idea where he is...
          They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a
          stamp and a UV light reader.

                              DOORMAN
                    Handstamp for re-entry?
                    Handstamp for re-entry?
          Everyone waves, no thanks -- except for Stu, who shrugs, why
          not, and stops, holding out his hand.

                              VICK
                    Maybe we should go back to the
                    hotel and--

                              STU
                    Oh my God, guys! Look!
          Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in
          STAMPS from all the clubs they've been to the night before!
          Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his ENTIRE FOREARM GLOWS,
          completely covered with stamps!
          The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV
          light, too: they all have the same stamps! Their eyes alight:

                              ALAN
                    It's like a map of last night!
          The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces!

                                                             CUT TO:

          EXT. LAS VEGAS/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          The guys rocket down the Strip, weaving in and out of
          traffic! All the stamps on Stu's arm are now labelled in
          regular ink. MUSIC blares, and the mood is high.

                              STU
                    Where do you want to start?!

                              VICK
                    At the top! We hit every club we
                    went to til someone remembers what
                    we did with Doug!

                              ALAN
                    Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe
                    we're actually gonna pull this off!
          Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.

                              STU
                    Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's
                    hat?!
          The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car
          over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT
          Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip.

                              VICK
                    Naaah, couldn't be.

                    Lots of people have hats like that.
          Stu nods, yeah, I guess...

          TIGHT ON: STU'S HAND
          The first bar written on it is "GhostBar."

                                                         MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. GHOSTBAR -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in
          medieval armor) from Alan's wedding. As they move into the
          club, every single waiter, bartender, and busboy sees them
          and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them!
          They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look --
          waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists,
          bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake
          their heads, we have no idea where Doug is...

          

                                                                     68.

          

          

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Stu crosses off "GhostBar" from his arm...

          INT. BODY ENGLISH NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The guys and Chastity enter and disperse. Again, everyone
          recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes -- and
          again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Stu crosses off another stamp from his arm...

          EXT. PURE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. TAO NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. ICE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          The guys race through a shadier, more industrial area of
          town, their hopes dimming...

                              STU
                    All right, this is the last place
                    we went, "Chaps."
          Vick rolls to a stop in front of...

          CHAPS NIGHTCLUB
          It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in
          line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear.

                              STU
                    You sure we came here...?
          Then they look up at the marquee. It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF

          THE GOLDEN PONY ALL MALE REVUE."

                              ALAN
                    The Golden Pony. That's us.

          

                                                                  69.

          

          

                              STU
                    Maybe I'll just wait in the car--
          But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.

          INT. CHAPS NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop. It's got a
          kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200 TOPLESS DUDES in cowboy
          hats and short-shorts grinding on each other.

                              VICK
                    You think we would've remembered
                    this...

                              STU
                    Yeah, I don't think we came here...

                              ALAN
                    Then why is your underwear nailed
                    to the wall?
          The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed
          to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads "CHAPS WALL OF
          FAME." We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS.

                              STU
                    Those could be anybody's. Thousands
                    of people go to Colorado State--

                              ALAN
                        (looking more closely)
                    Oh my God, are they autographed?

                              VICK

                        (READING)
                    "Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I     Chaps!"

          

                              STU
                        (realizing, stunned)
                    I am so gay...
          Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling.

                              WAITER
                    Hey, guys! Roger is backstage!
          The guys look at each other, eyes wide.

                               STU
                    R-Roger?

          

                                                                  70.

          

          

          INT. CHAPS -- DANCE FLOOR

          The guys move through the throng of undulating, sweaty men,
          uncomfortable. Alan takes Chastity's hand tightly.

                              ALAN
                    Stay very close to me.
          She smiles and dances through the crowd.

          INT. CHAPS -- BACKSTAGE AREA

          They reach a HUGE MALE BOUNCER guarding the backstage area.
          He sees the guys and unclips the VELVET ROPE, kissing each of
          them on the cheek as they pass.

                              BOUNCER
                    How are Haylee and Kaitlin?

                              STU
                        (totally disturbed)
                    Oh. G-Good, thanks...?

          INT. BACKSTAGE AREA -- DRESSING ROOM DOOR

          The guys reach the dressing room door and stop. They inhale.

                              VICK
                    We're going to love you either way,
                    Stu...
          Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game.

                              ALAN
                    Some of my best friends are gay.

                              STU
                    Is that true?

                              ALAN
                    Not...not really? I live in
                    Connecticut, man, we don't even
                    have black people yet.
          Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters...

          INT. CHAPS -- DRESSING ROOM

          The dressing room is packed with muscular, tan, buck-naked
          men, walking around, rubbing baby oil on themselves, donning
          chaps and codpieces, getting ready for the next show.

          

                                                                    71.

          

          
          Chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake,
          staying ridiculously close together. Vick stops at one
          dancer, trying not to look down at his junk:

                              VICK
                    Excuse me, friend, can you tell me
                    where Roger is?

                              BEEFCAKE COWBOY
                    Oh, hey, Vick! Roger's over there.
          He points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky
          mullet, stretching out in front of his mirror. The guys
          shuffle over to him. Vick tries to be supportive with Stu:

                              VICK
                    He's cute...I guess...?
          Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees
          them, and smiles.

                              ROGER
                    Oh! Hey guys!
          He hugs all of them. The guys make sure to keep their asses
          arched back to avoid genital contact.

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    I'm surprised you're even walking
                    yet, Stu.

                               STU
                        (inhaling sharply)
                    Oh my god.

                              VICK
                    Listen, man, we don't really
                    remember what happened last night,
                    can you fill us in?

                              ROGER
                    Really? No memory?
          Stu shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared...

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    Well, I must say, Stu, I'm a little
                    hurt.

                              STU
                    Did we...you know...do anything?

                              ROGER
                    Well, duh? Yeah?

          

                                                                    72.

          

          
          The guys all freeze. A beat. Then Vick pats Stu's shoulder,
          supportive.

                              STU
                    Was I...the boy or the girl?

                              ROGER
                    Oh, honey, you were everything.
          Stu WHIMPERS. Vick and Alan exchange a look, holy shit!

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    But you were nothing like Vick.

                              VICK
                    Wait-- what?!

                              ROGER
                    I know, I'm sort of over group
                    stuff too, but Alan insisted.
          Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned.

                              VICK
                    You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!

                              ALAN
                    I don't know! I don't know why I
                    insisted!

                              ROGER
                    Actually, after the anger went
                    away, it was really quite tender.
          The guys look at each other, nauseous.

                              STU
                    I'm really not sure we can be
                    friends anymore...
          Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING.

                              CHASTITY
                    Guys: he's kidding.
          Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The
          guys all exhale, incredibly relieved.

                              VICK
                    Not cool, Roger. Not cool.

                              ALAN
                    So what did happen last night?

          

                                                                  73.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    Oh, well, you guys came in near the
                    end of our last set, like 2ish.
                    Doug pretty much dragged you in.

                              ALAN
                    Really? Doug did?

                              ROGER
                    Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug.
                    Black guy, shaved head?
          The guys look at each other, confused.

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    He's a cake designer, he said he
                    met you guys at some sort of
                    birthday party at the Rio?

                              VICK
                        (snapping his finger)
                    The guy from the Jimmy Lang
                    surveillance video.
          The guys nod, right.

                              ROGER
                    Anyway, for the big finale of our
                    show, we always bring someone on
                    stage, and, well, Stu, you
                    volunteered pretty aggressively.
                        (to nearby dancer)
                    Hey Dallas, do we have the video of
                    last night's show?

                              STU
                    No! That's cool, I don't need to
                    see it--

                              VICK
                    We must see that video.

                              DALLAS
                    It's in the machine.
          Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting
          in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback,
          Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS.
          Roger fast forwards.

          

                                                                  74.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    You were pretty mellow at first,
                    Stu, but once we got you into the
                    chaps, you really came alive-- oh,
                    here it is.

          
          ON THE TV we see Stu, wearing only his "I    ROGER" g-string
          and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony
          dancers. He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the
          greased young studs. The guys look away, oooo.

                              STU
                    I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym
                    as much as I'd like...

                              ROGER
                    You even taught us The Pony, which
                    we'd never even heard of before...
          ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly
          gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him.
          Stu's face drops.

                               ROGER (CONT'D)
                    And then, of course, the pièce de
                    resistance: the Ride of the
                    Valkyries.
          ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride
          a LAVENDER MECHANICAL BULL together. The crowd goes wild.

                              STU
                    Annnnd that would explain the
                    searing ass pain.

                              ROGER
                    After the show, we split a couple
                    pitchers of flirtinis, you had our
                    stylist cut your hair like mine,
                    and then you split.

                              VICK
                    And what time was all this?

                              ROGER
                    4:30 in the morning? 4:45?

                              ALAN
                    And our Doug was with us?

          

                                                                   75.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    Yeah, he had passed out by then,
                    but you carried him out. It was all
                    very Officer And A Gentleman.
          The guys look at each other, confused.

                              ALAN
                    Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45,
                    we got back to the hotel at 5:00,
                    and Doug was gone by 5:30 when
                    Chastity met back up with us?

                              STU
                    That doesn't make any sense.

                              VICK
                    Did we lose him along the way?

                              STU
                    He was passed out, how far could he
                    have gone--?
          Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads
          "MANDALAY BAY." He answers:

                              VICK
                    Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          Atashir is on the phone at the reception desk.

                              ATASHIR
                    Mr. Lennon?

                              VICK
                    Atashir, many greetings to you.

                               ATASHIR
                    I thought you might like to know
                    that one of our maids just found
                    your friend, Douglas, passed out in
                    your room.
          Vick's jaw drops.

                              VICK
                    What?! Are you sure it's him?!

          

                                                                  76.

          

          

                              ATASHIR
                    I saw him with my own eyes. He is
                    unconscious but breathing nicely.

                              VICK
                    Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a
                    man of great honor! A thousand
                    blessings upon your ancestors!
          Vick SLAMS his phone shut, overjoyed.

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    Doug is in the room! A maid just
                    found him! He's passed out, but
                    he's okay!

                              STU
                    They're sure it's him?!

                              VICK
                    Atashir swears it is!
          The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted.

                              STU
                    Oh thank God he's okay...

                              ALAN
                    After all this?! He's in the room?!
          They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt. Vick even
          hugs Roger.

                              VICK
                    I don't even care! Hug me, you big
                    shiny homosexual!

          EXT. CHAPS -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys bound out of Chaps, jubilant. Stu is
          carrying a box of TWO DOZEN VIDEOTAPES.

                              ALAN
                    That was cool of Roger to give you
                    all the tapes of your performance.

                              STU
                    I know, if I actually was gay, I'd
                    totally date Roger first. What a
                    gentle soul.
          They get into Vick's clunker.

          

                                                                   77.

          

          

                              VICK
                    How we doing on time?

                              ALAN
                        (looking at watch)

                    2:22.

                              VICK
                    We'll be in LA by dawn.
                        (firing up engine)
                    I told you bitches this would all
                    work out...
          They drive off into the night, grins all around.

          EXT. THE STRIP/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Vick drives, Stu sits shotgun. Alan sits in the back with
          Chastity. The cool night air washes over them. They look
          happily exhausted.

                              ALAN
                    This has officially been the
                    craziest weekend of my life.
                        (to Chastity)
                    Thanks for all your help. You were
                    awesome.

                              CHASTITY
                    Anything for my hubby.
          Alan's smile flickers slightly.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    I'm kidding, Alan. I know last
                    night wasn't, you know, real...
          She looks out at Vegas as it flies by.

                              ALAN
                    I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.

                                CHASTITY
                    Jennifer.

                              ALAN
                    Beg pardon?

                              CHASTITY
                    My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly.
          Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more...human.

          

                                                                  78.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the
                    first flaky decision I've ever made
                    in my life. I mean, I am a
                    stripper.
          Alan tries not to laugh. She smiles, a twinge sadly.

                              ALAN
                    Where you from?

                              CHASTITY
                    LA. Tarzana.

                               ALAN
                    Oh yeah?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah. I work here on the weekends.

                              ALAN
                    You fly out every week?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a
                    great school.

                               ALAN
                    Kid?

                              VICK
                        (aside, to Stu)
                    They always have kids.

                              CHASTITY
                    I have a little girl, Sarah.
                    She's... Well, she's everything.
          Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute
          little toddler. Alan smiles.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    What about you?

                              ALAN
                    No kids. Same girlfriend for 14
                    years. Becky.
          Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.

          

                                                               79.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    Wow, she's stunning.
          Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer:

                              STU
                    We like you way better.

                              ALAN

                    STU!
          Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Becky is great.

                              STU
                    Becky collects teapots.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, she's a total canwego.

                              CHASTITY
                    A what?

                              VICK
                    You know, she's the girl at the
                    party who's always like "Can we go?
                    Can we go?"
          Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head.

                              ALAN
                    She has low blood sugar.

                              STU
                    She has low fun sugar.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm
                    going to marry!
                        (beat, considers)
                    If, you know...she forgives me for
                    cheating on her...

                              VICK
                    Wait: you're going to tell her?

                              ALAN
                    Of course I'm going to tell her! I
                    could never keep something like
                    that from her.

          

                                                                     80.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me
                    for scratching her Queensryche CD
                    in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever
                    gonna forgive you for marrying a
                    stripper in Vegas.

                              ALAN
                    Well, then that's just the price
                    I'm going to have to pay.
          Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud.

                              CHASTITY
                    Good for you.
          She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her
          face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment...

                              VICK
                    She's gonna cut your dick off,
                    dude.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet
          stand. Vick rolls up in his clunker. The guys hop out.

                              VICK
                        (to the valet)
                    Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be
                    right back.

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite.
          Vick unlocks their door and pushes inside.

                              VICK
                    Doug! Wake up, man!

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT

          Instead of finding Doug, however, they find KALOLO FANALUA,
          sitting on their couch, pissed. He's got a huge WHITE CAST on
          his right arm, courtesy of the strip club bouncers.

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    Aloha, assholes.
          The guys freeze.

          

                                                                  81.

          

          

                                STU
                    Uh-oh.
          The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see
          KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit.
          He has an identical CAST on his right arm.

                                STU (CONT'D)
                    Not good.
          Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a
          red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands. We recognize
          him from his police photo as crime boss JIMMY LANG, 50's.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Oh, hello. Good to see you again.

                              VICK
                    Where is Doug?

                              ALAN
                    Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did
                    last night, we are incredibly sorry-

                              JIMMY LANG
                    These your rich friends you were
                    telling me about, Vick?
          Alan and Stu glance at Vick, confused.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Oh, you haven't told them yet?
                    Really, that's low. Even for you.

                              ALAN
                    What's going on, Vick?
          Vick stammers, trying to find the words...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Six months ago, your friend Vick
                    borrowed some money from me at what
                    can only be described as a very
                    unfavorable interest rate. When the
                    loan came due, he failed to pay me
                    back, but he promised me that he
                    could get the money from you guys
                    this weekend.
          Alan and Stu look at Vick, shocked and hurt.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, Vick...

          

                                                                  82.

          

          

                              STU
                    How could you do this to us, man?
                    We're your best friends...
          Vick looks away, ashamed.

                              VICK
                    They were gonna hurt me, man...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Well, Vick, it looks like you and
                    your friends have some issues to
                    discuss. In the meantime...
          He draws a huge, red-plated .357 MAGNUM.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    I need my goddamn money.
          The guys jump back, whoa! Vick holds up his hands:

                              VICK
                    I can get it! I can! I just--

                              JIMMY LANG
                    I've heard that before, Vick,
                    including last night, when you so
                    rudely skipped out on my birthday
                    party. That's why I've taken some
                    collateral to ensure your payment.
                    His name is Doug.
          The guys all look sick.

                              VICK
                    You have Doug?

                              STU
                    Oh my God...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    If you want your friend to live,
                    meet me at mile marker 26 off
                    Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the
                    money. Are we clear?

                                VICK
                    Yes! Yes.
          Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him.

                              ALAN
                    M-M-Mr. Lang?

          

                                                                   83.

          

          

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Yes, Mr. Mervish?

                              ALAN
                    H-How much does Vick owe?

                                                              CUT TO:

                              ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    200 thousand dollars?!

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Alan and Stu pace about the suite, beyond stressed. Vick
          stands, looking out the window. Chastity gets them all water.

                              ALAN
                    How the hell could you blow that
                    kind of money?!

                              STU
                    Was it for the custard store?

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no
                    custard store! Vick was just trying
                    to rip us off to pay back Jimmy
                    Lang!

                              STU
                    Is that true, Vick?
          Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Were any of your deals...real?

                              VICK

                        (GUILTY)
                    Some.
          Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned...

                              STU
                    Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that
                    money meant something to me...
          Vick spins around, furious:

                              VICK
                    Do you really think I wanted my
                    life to turn out like this, Stu?!
                    Do you really think I don't know
                    that I'm a massive loser?!

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                   84.

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Jesus, you guys got out of high
                    school and you just knew what to
                    do, you went to college and got
                    good jobs and found cool wives and
                    made beautiful children -- what do
                    I have to show for the last decade
                    of my life?! Nothing!
          Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES
          against the wall!
          The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only
                    thing I really have...the only
                    thing I really have is you guys.

                              STU
                    Come on, Vick--

                              VICK
                    No, man, it's true! I put on a good
                    show, but my life is so goddamn
                    hollow and vapid and lonely, it
                    scares me, man. I-I don't know how
                    much longer I can keep this scam
                    going. And now I've gone and ruined
                    the one good thing I had...
          Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Just...please don't give up on me,
                    okay? I-I don't know what I'd do
                    without you guys. I really don't...
          Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky
          Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in.

                              STU
                    Come on, man, we've been bro's
                    since third grade, it's gonna take
                    a lot more than money to ruin our
                    friendship.
          Vick looks down, deeply touched...

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    What I don't understand is why you
                    didn't just ask me for the money. I
                    would've given you every last cent
                    I had, man...

          

                                                                  85.

          

          
          Tears trail down Vick's cheeks. He crosses and gives Stu a
          hug. Stu hugs back, emotional.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    I love you, man.

                              VICK
                    Love you too, bro. Love you too.
          They hug tight. For a while.

                              STU
                    Also, I banged your sister
                    sophomore year.
          Vick pulls away.

                              VICK
                    What?!

                              STU
                    Sorry. Just seemed like a good time
                    to tell you.
          Vick stammers at Stu, speechless.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    She had just broken up with that
                    guy from Central, we were playing
                    "I Never" at Tim Donahee's pool,
                    one thing lead to another--

                              VICK
                    No! No. That's...that's plenty.
          Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan
          just frowns at his watch, stressed.

                              ALAN
                    Look, I'm glad we're all sharing,
                    but we've got three hours to come
                    up with 200 grand, or else...
          The guys nod, frowning, back on point.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    I'd offer to take a loan out, but
                    it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm
                    pretty sure my bank is closed.

                              STU
                    I think I can get a 20 grand cash
                    advance on my credit card...

          

                                                                     86.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    So that just leaves 180 grand...
          The guys frown at each other.

                              CHASTITY
                    Well, it is Vegas...
          The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...?

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

          ALAN THROWING DOWN BLACKJACK AT A BLACKJACK TABLE
          The guys erupt in CHEERS around him, YAAA! The dealer slides
          over a large pile of CHIPS.

                                                              CUT TO:

          CHASTITY THROWING CRAPS AT A CRAPS TABLE
          Again the guys erupt! Alan hugs Chastity. Their pile of CHIPS
          grows...

                                                              CUT TO:

          STU YELLING "BINGO" AT A BINGO TABLE
          The guys jump up, slapping ten, YELLING! Stu points at a
          table full of OLD LADIES nearby: in your face!

                                                              CUT TO:

          ALAN, STU, VICK AND CHASTITY SITTING AT A PAI GOW TABLE
          looking lost. Then they take their large stack of chips and
          quietly leave. No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker.

                                                              CUT TO:

          VICK JUMPING UP FROM A WAR TABLE
          having just won! Chastity and the guys aggressively hug him.
          Stu drinks from his glass, hands shaking, wired.

                              STU
                    Time check!

                              VICK
                        (looking at watch)
                    12 minutes.

                              STU
                    Chip check!

          

                                                                      87.

          

          
          Alan quickly counts the chips...

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Faster! Come on chip check!

                              VICK
                    Dude, how many Red Bulls have you
                    had?

                              STU
                    I stopped counting at six! I can
                    hear my heart beating in my head!
          Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns.

                              ALAN
                    Just over 100 grand.
          The guys wince, damn.

                              VICK
                    There's only one thing left to do.
          They all exchange a knowing look...

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

          $100,000 WORTH OF CHIPS BEING PLACED ON BLACK
          at a roulette table. The guys sweat, tense. Stu is insane.

                              STU
                    You sure we don't want red?! What
                    if the ball lands on red--!

                              VICK
                    Shut up, Stu.

                              ROULETTE CROUPIER
                    Betting is closed.
          The Croupier drops the ball into the wheel. It bounces, hops,
          spins... Vick crosses himself. Stu looks away.

                              STU
                    I can't watch! My   heart's gonna
                    explode! Can your   heart even
                    explode?! Because   I think my heart
                    is gonna explode!   I can't watch!
          The ball lands. Dead silence.

          

                                                                    88.

          

          

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    It's red, isn't it?! I knew it!
                    Tell me it's not red!

                              ALAN
                    It's not red...
          Stu turns, ecstatic--

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    It's green.
          The ball has stopped on green, DOUBLE ZERO. Stu clutches his
          chest, like he's having a seizure. Vick inhales, grim. Alan
          slowly drops to his knees. Chastity closes her eyes.
          Their HUGE PILE OF CHIPS is raked off the table...

                                                               CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- PARKING CIRCLE -- PRE-DAWN

          The guys pack their bags into Vick's beat-up Caddy. The mood
          is as dark as the pre-dawn sky. When the car is loaded,
          Chastity takes Alan's hands, gentle.

                              CHASTITY
                    Would you like me to come with?

                              ALAN
                    No...It might get a little
                    dangerous. I wouldn't want...
          He trails off. Chastity nods.

                              CHASTITY
                    I'm so sorry...about everything.

                              ALAN
                    Thanks for all your help.
          Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.

                              CHASTITY
                    There's no sense...in exchanging
                    numbers or anything...right?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, probably not...
          Alan looks genuinely sad.

          

                                                                  89.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    Well...I'll always remember you as
                    a great first husband, then.
          They both smile weakly.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    You can just send the divorce
                    papers to the Crazy Horse or
                    whatever...
          Alan nods, okay. Another awkward pause.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for reminding me that there
                    are still some really good guys out
                    there, Alan. I don't...I don't get
                    to meet too many of them.
          She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks
          off. TIGHT ON Alan's Grandmother's ring still on her finger.
          Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy
          watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense
          of loss...
          Then Vick fires up the car next to him.

                              VICK
                    We gotta go, man.
          Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- PRE-DAWN

          Vick's car races down a dark, abandoned desert highway. The
          guys look tired, stressed, and most of all, scared.

                              ALAN
                    Yep, just driving out to the middle
                    of desert to meet some mobsters,
                    what could possibly go wrong...?
          The guys all frown.

                              STU
                    So what's our plan?

                              ALAN
                    I think we should tell Mr. Lang
                    that we couldn't get the money, but
                    that, if he's amenable, we could
                    create a payment calendar--

          

                                                                     90.

          

          

                              VICK
                    We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag
                    of money, grab Doug, and make a run
                    for it.

                              ALAN
                    Yes, good! What an airtight plan--!

                               VICK
                    Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment
                    calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is
                    our only shot of getting Doug back!
                    Left turn!
          Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road.
          Things are quickly going from bad to worse...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          THE FIRST RAYS OF DAWN
          streaking across Venice Beach.

          TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 6:04AM"

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- MORNING

          Tracy exits her bedroom in her jammies, looking like she
          barely slept. Her father is up, and making breakfast.

                              TRACY
                    Any word from Doug?

                               MR. TURNER
                    Nope.

                        (BEAT)
                    I know you don't want to hear it,
                    Trace, but you deserve better.
          Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress.

                              TRACY
                    I'm sure everything's fine. They're
                    all smart, capable adults...

                                                              CUT TO:

          VICK DELICATELY LAYING CASH INSIDE HIS DUFFEL BAG
          on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create
          the appearance of a bag full of money. He's using some $20
          bills, but also some $5's and $1's.

          

                                                                     91.

          

          

                              VICK
                    This all the cash we got?
          The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are

          INT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAWN

          The Caddy is parked next to MILE MARKER 26 in the middle of
          the windy desert. The Las Vegas skyline is just barely
          visible in the distance.
          Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to
          disturb the bills, and places it on his lap.

                              ALAN
                    This is the dumbest plan ever.

                              VICK
                    Alan I need you positive please.

                              STU
                    Here they come.
          They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far
          horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up.

                              VICK
                    Stuart?

                              STU
                    Yeah?

                              VICK
                    There's an emergency bottle of
                    tequila in my glove box. Get it out
                    please.
          Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He
          opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a
          pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks.
          They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer.

                              ALAN
                    I can't believe this is how we're
                    going to die...
          The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves.
          The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open...
          TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road...

          

                                                                     92.

          

          
          TIGHT ON Vick's LEATHER SHOE, then Alan's SAILING TOPSIDER,
          then Stu's FLIP-FLOP, as they all hit the dusty road...
          The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off.
          Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake RATTLES.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Let's see the money!
          Vick gently holds up his duffel bag.

                              VICK
                    Let's see Doug!
          Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the
          Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back
          and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit.
          The guys look a bit alarmed.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, what'd they do to him?

                              VICK
                    Pull off the Ralph's bag!
          Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal

          IT'S NOT DOUG
          It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused.

                              VICK
                    Who the hell is that?!

                              JIMMY LANG

                        (ANNOYED)
                    This is Doug!
          He pushes the guy forward.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my God: it's the other Doug!
                    Roger's friend, the cake designer!

                              BLACK DOUG
                        (to Jimmy Lang)
                    I told you, man, I'm Doug Howland!
                    I barely even know these guys!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!

          

                                                                    93.

          

          
          Jimmy Lang and the thugs look exasperated.

                                 JIMMY LANG
                    You sure?!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, man, our Doug is white!

                              JIMMY LANG
                    But you were partying with this guy
                    at my birthday thing!

                              VICK
                    I don't know what to tell you, bro,
                    this isn't the Doug we requested!

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Well. I apologize for the mix-up...
                        (drawing his HUGE GUN)
                    But I'm still gonna need my money.
          Vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Don't move, Vick.
          Vick freezes, duffel in hand, as Stu and Alan slink from
          view. Jimmy reaches Vick, gun calmly trained at his head.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Now please. Give me my money.
          All eyes on Vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand...
          Sweat beads on his brow...

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Don't be stupid, son. You--
          Then Vick throws a hard left hook, SLAMMING Jimmy square in
          his massive stomach! And

          NOTHING HAPPENS
          Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy
          PISTOL-WHIPS Vick -- his lip explodes with blood and he falls
          to the ground.

                              VICK
                    Christ that hurts!

          

                                                                     94.

          

          
          Then Jimmy picks up the duffel bag. Hefts it. Feels wrong. He
          goes to open the zipper when he hears:

                               STU

                     AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
          Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the
          linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun, but

          STU TACKLES JIMMY TO THE GROUND FIRST!
          The gun flies free and they wrestle for it! Dust flies!

          BACK BY THE YUKON
          The two Guamians fumble for their guns -- but it's difficult
          with huge CASTS on their shooting hands!

          ON BLACK DOUG
          He sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his
          back, takes off sprinting towards Vegas!

          BY THE CADDILAC
          Alan looks around, what should I do?! What should I do?! Then
          he spots the keys in the ignition of the car. He hops in and
          fires up the engine! Just then

          THE TWO GUAMIANS OPEN FIRE
          Bullets pound into the Cadillac! Alan ducks down, terrified,
          and floors the gas!

                               ALAN
                     I'm being shot at! I'm being shot
                     at!

          UP AHEAD
          Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun,
          panting. He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the ground.

                               JIMMY LANG
                     I really didn't want to kill anyone

                     TODAY--
          Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph!
          The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good
          ten yards away, in a heap of dust!
          The guys freeze, shocked.

          

                                                                  95.

          

          
          The Guamians freeze, shocked.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my god, is he okay?!

                              VICK
                    Who cares! Go go!
          Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in!
          The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and
          dust! The Guamians FIRE after them!

          BULLETS IMPACT ALL ALL OVER CAR
          taking out the tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests.
          The guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away. Then
          they sit up, amazed, out of breath.

                              STU
                    I can't believe you just saved my
                    life!

                              VICK
                    I can't believe you just drove my
                    car into Jimmy Lang!
          Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.

                              STU
                    He's gonna be really upset!

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, I was just thinking that!

          BACK ON JIMMY LANG
          The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two
          henchmen waddle up, highly concerned.

                              KIKIOLANI
                    Boss, Boss, you okay?!
          Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Find Vick... And kill him.

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- DAWN

          The guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence.

                              ALAN
                    Now can we call Tracy?

          

                                                                  96.

          

          
          Vick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve.

                              VICK
                    Yeah. It's probably time.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- LONE PAYPHONE -- DAWN

          The guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of
          the desert. They all look at the phone.

                              ALAN
                    Who wants to make the call?
          Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and
          Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close.

                              STU
                    That was you!

                              ALAN
                    What?! No! I beat you by a mile!

                              STU
                    Vick, who won?!

                               VICK

                        (FROWNING)
                    Actually...I should do it. This
                    weekend was mostly my fault. I need
                    to Man Up.
          Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound
          sense of responsibility.

                              ALAN
                    Well, I'll be damned...
          Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat.

                              VICK
                    I still can't believe Stu banged my
                    sister.
          Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the
          pay phone...

          INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

          Tracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite. Her stern
          dad blows in.

                              MR. TURNER
                    Any word from Doug?
          The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
          about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.

                              TRACY
                    No, but I'm sure he's--
          Just then, Tracy's CELL PHONE rings. She quickly answers it.

                                TRACY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH:

          VICK
          In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted
          aviators into the rising sun.

                              VICK
                    Tracy, it's Vick.

                                TRACY
                    Hey Vick!

                              VICK
                    Listen, honey...The bachelor party
                    got a little out of control and,
                    well...we lost Doug.

                              TRACY
                        (her jaw dropping)
                    What?! But we're getting married in
                    like four hours!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that's not gonna happen...

          BACK IN THE CAR
          Alan starts to take a pull of Patron -- when he freezes,
          realizing something!

          BACK TO VICK
          on the phone with Tracy, being genuinely contrite.

                              VICK
                    Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This
                    is all my fault--

          

                                                                    98.

          

          
          Suddenly, Alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver
          out of Vick's hand!

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    What the--?!
          Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing.

                              ALAN
                    Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just
                    joking around! We've got Doug right
                    here!
          Vick looks like: what?!

                              TRACY

                        (HORRIFIED)
                    What kind of joke is that?!

                              ALAN
                    I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll
                    see you at the wedding! Bye!
          Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows.

                              VICK
                    What are you doing?

                              ALAN

                               VICK
                    So how did--?

                    And that's why we've been seeing
                    Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He
                    was trying to signal someone!

                              VICK
                    I don't believe it...

                    And it totally jives with the
                    timeline, right?! We brought Doug
                    back to the hotel at 5:00, he was
                    passed out...

                              VICK
                    It's so obvious!

                    The Patron, man! It reminded me of
                    our first drink of the night!

                    Honestly, dude, you're a genius.

                    He's on the roof!
          Stu looks confused, the roof?

                     taken him up there in his bed as a

                     or whatever? Then we forgot him.

                               VICK

          The guys burst out of the steel door, onto the massive black

          Then...stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent,
          naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink
          from sunburn...

          IS DOUG!
          And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed!

          Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and

                    Don't...even...talk to me.

                                                              CUT TO:

          EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- DAY

          All the seats at the wedding are filled. Everyone is there.
          Except the Groomsmen. Or the Groom. The harpist still plays,
          though she's starting to look a little pissed.

          INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

          Looking beautiful in her wedding gown, Tracy gazes out of the
          window at the perfect wedding arranged below...
          Then she notices guests whispering, is something wrong?
          Where's the groom? She turns away, trying to hold it
          together...

                                                              CUT TO:

          INT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY

          The guys,   now in their tuxes, rocket down the freeway,
          primping.   Alan brushes his teeth, Doug tries to comb his
          hair, Stu   flosses, and Vick shaves with an electric razor as
          he weaves   in and out of traffic...

                                                              CUT TO:

          TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 10:19AM"

          INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

          Tracy paces in the bridal suite. Then Mr. Turner enters.

                              MR. TURNER
                    I'm sorry, honey, but I think you
                    need to seriously consider that
                    Doug might not be coming...
          Tracy stops short, speechless.

                               MR. TURNER (CONT'D)
                    Some men just aren't cut out for
                    this kind of commitment. I'm so
                    sorry that this is how you had to
                    find out--
          Just then, we hear a car SQUEALING UP outside...

          INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB

          The Bridesmaids sit around the posh lobby, waiting, anxious.
          Just then, the doors blow open and

          VICK, ALAN, STU, AND DOUG
          stride inside! Their tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a
          mess, and the groom is bright pink -- but they're here.

                              VICK
                    Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy
                    route. We ready to do this thing?
          The bridesmaids sit up, stunned.

                                                             CUT TO:

          TRACY AND HER FATHER
          walking down the aisle, arm-in-arm, as Mozart plays. Tracy
          looks tentative. Her father frowns, not at all happy...

          IN THE AUDIENCE
          Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps photos...

          AT THE ALTAR
          The groomsmen smile as well. Vick whispers to Doug:

                              VICK
                    She looks beautiful, man.

          

                                                                 105.

          

          
          Doug still doesn't speak to him.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    That's cool. I get it.

          TRACY
          reaches the altar, then turns to her dad. His face is a mess
          of emotions. They hug.

                              TRACY
                    I love you, Daddy.

                              MR. TURNER
                    I love you too, pumpkin.
          Tracy's Dad shoots Doug a nasty look before taking his seat
          in the first row.
          Then Tracy approaches Doug at the altar, and whispers to him,
          angry, hurt:

                              TRACY
                    Where were you? And why are you
                    pink?

                              DOUG
                    It's a long story. All I can say is
                    I'm so sorry. And I promise, for as
                    long as we're married, I will never
                    ever put you through something like
                    this again.
                        (desperate, pleading)
                    Can... Can you forgive me?
          Tracy studies his face, searching...
          All the guests wait with bated breath...
          The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on...
          Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him.
          He kisses her back. The guests all SIGH in relief. The
          groomsmen exhale, whew. Vick and Alan covertly knock fists.
          The Minister clears his throat.

                              MINISTER
                    We, um, we traditionally wait til
                    the end for the kiss...?
          But Doug and Tracy just keep on kissing...

                                                 MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

          

                                                                    106.

          

          

          DOUG AND TRACY STILL KISSING
          at the reception. The entire wedding party is applauding.

          CHAMPAGNE IS UNCORKED
          and the WEDDING BAND kicks in. We are now down on the lawn,
          where white tables and a dance floor have been set up.

          STANDING IN THE BACK OF THE RECEPTION
          Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the
          bride and the groom.

                              VICK
                    We did it, fellahs. We pulled it
                    off.

                              ALAN
                    I never had a doubt.
          They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen
          him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their
          first dance on the dance floor.

                              STU
                    You think Doug's ever going to talk
                    to us again?

                              VICK
                    Give him time.

                              ALAN
                    Yeah. Like a decade or two--
          Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder.

                              STU
                    Uh-oh.
          The guys all look over to see

          BECKY
          Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate.

                              VICK
                    Hey Beck--!

                              BECKY
                    Shut up, Vick! Alan, where the hell
                    have you been?! I've been calling
                    and calling! What, you don't answer
                    your phone anymore?!

          

                                                                    107.

          

          
          Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend.

                               ALAN
                     I-I'm so sorry, I can explain--
          Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                     Alan?
          They all turn to see

          CHASTITY
          standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her
          hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows, whoa.

                               VICK
                     This just got complicated...

                                 ALAN
                     Jennifer?
          Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.

                               CHASTITY
                     I-I know I wasn't invited, but I
                     just had to return this...
          She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING. Becky
          watches on, stunned.

                               BECKY
                     Okay: who the hell is this chick,
                     and why the hell does she have your
                     Grandmother's wedding ring?!
          Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity...
          It's the moment of truth. The fork in life's road...

                               BECKY (CONT'D)
                     Talk, you moron! Jesus, you're just
                     like your mother! Talk! Who's the
                     ho wearing my ring?!
          And in that moment, it all becomes so clear. Alan turns:

                               ALAN
                     She's my wife.
          Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick
          grin, oh shit!

          

                                                                 108.

          

          

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    We don't make each other happy
                    anymore, Beck. And we can keep not
                    making each other happy for another
                    14 years -- hell, maybe even
                    another 50 years -- but let's not.
                    Let's find people who make our
                    hearts race. Let's be excited and
                    fun and alive again...
          Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat.

                              BECKY
                    Are you fucking kidding me?
          Alan shakes his head, sadly, no.

                              ALAN
                    I'm sorry, Beck. I really am.
                        (to Chastity)
                    Can I buy you a free drink?
          Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together
          towards the bar.

                              CHASTITY
                    We're not...actually...still
                    married, are we?

                              ALAN
                    Let's start with dinner, and see
                    where it goes...?

                              CHASTITY
                        (smiling warmly)
                    I'd like that.

          BACK ON BECKY
          She finally recovers enough to speak:

                              BECKY
                    Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back
                    here this second!
                        (but Alan keeps walking)
                    Don't you walk away from me, you
                    stupid little clown! I own you! GET

                    BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY!
          But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity. Vick and Stu
          wave him on, go dude! Go!
          Then Becky turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified.

          

                                                                    109.

          

          

          STAY WITH STU
          as he hurries off through the crowd. After a moment, he

          HEARS:

                              VOICE
                    Daddy?!
          Stu turns to see his TWO ANGELIC DAUGHTERS in sundresses
          racing through the crowd towards him! They leap into his
          arms, so excited to see him! He scoops them both up.

                              STU
                    Oh, I missed you guys so much!

                              HAYLEE
                    We missed you too, daddy!

                              KAITLIN
                    You're the best dad ever!
          Beat.
          And then Stu just starts BAWLING. Tears everywhere.
          His lovely wife ERIN appears, harried, a diaper bag over her
          shoulder, and sees him crying. She rolls her eyes.

                              ERIN
                    Jesus, are you still drunk?
          Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps SOBBING as he pulls her
          into a big family hug...

          INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- LATER

          Vick, a cocktail in hand, his tie undone, heads into the
          men's room and approaches a urinal. Then KIKIOLANI and KALOLO
          FANALUA walk in behind him, still in their huge arm casts,
          still very pissed. Vick inhales, scared.

                              VICK
                    Okay, okay, I'll go with you.
                    Just...don't ruin the wedding.
          Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    I really didn't want it to end like
                    this, Vick.
          Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him. Then Jimmy
          extends his hand for Vick to shake.

          

                                                                   110.

          

          

                                 JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Good luck.

                              VICK
                        (totally thrown)
                    Um, what...?

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Your friend Alan just paid your
                    marker. Took out a second mortgage
                    on his house. The full 200 grand,
                    plus medical expenses, which I
                    thought was a classy touch.
          Vick looks blown away.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Without our friends, we are
                    nothing, Vick. Remember that.
          The three injured mobsters exit. Vick remains standing there,
          overwhelmed, his life literally saved...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          VICK, STU, AND ALAN
          standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in
          hand, as the wedding reception rages on behind them.

                              VICK
                    I will pay you back, you know.

                              ALAN
                    Damn straight you will!
          They all LAUGH.

                              VOICE BEHIND THEM
                    Okay, so what the hell happened
                    this weekend?
          The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling. They grin as
          he falls in with them, looking out at the calm blue ocean.

                              VICK
                    Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu
                    went gay, and I learned a very
                    important life lesson from an obese
                    hoodlum.

                              STU
                    We'll tell you the whole story when
                    you get back from your honeymoon.

          

                                                                   111.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    We really are sorry, man.
          Doug nods, I know. Vick raises his cocktail.

                              VICK
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              STU
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              ALAN
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              DOUG
                    To me and Tracy -- and to being
                    here, with my three former best
                    friends in the world...
          The guys LAUGH.

                               DOUG (CONT'D)
                    There's nowhere else I'd rather be
                    right now.
          They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    That said, let's not get too stupid
                    tonight, okay? I'm going on my
                    honeymoon in 24 hours...
          The guys all nod reassuringly.

                              THE GUYS
                    No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
                    dude.
          The guys exchange a sly smile, CLINK glasses, then

                                                         CUT TO BLACK.


         THE END
