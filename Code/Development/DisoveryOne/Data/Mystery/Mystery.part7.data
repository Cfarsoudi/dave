FADE IN:

Moving through a murky haze.  Dark blues and greens, shafts
of prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance.
Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera.
We're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens
into focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water,
arms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured by
flowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING
GREEN EYES, which blink closed...

                                                    MORPH TO:

...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from
water.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in
her bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the
kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side,
reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being
pulled.

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

A HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound.

A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Claire
starts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses the
red G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue spark
shoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer
starts whirring again.

She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  She
regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant-
looking woman around forty.

Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR
above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek,
as if confirming her existence.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire, now dressed, presses her face against a door,
listening for the sounds of stirring from within.  Silence.
She quietly pushes open the door.

INT.  ROOM - DAY

Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a
window, then pulls the curtains to reveal:

A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A
24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE
LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake.

The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE
still shrouded by covers.

Claire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the room
briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a
tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.

She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same
face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped
hair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales the
sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places her
hand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly.

                     CLAIRE
          Morning, beauty.

Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.

                     CLAIRE
          Let's go.  Or we'll never leave on time.

From out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice.

                     CAITLIN
               (muffled)
          I'm totally ready.

Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on, I'll make you some waffles,
          maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the
          mall.
               (beat)
          Caitlin...

Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's
behind.

                     CAITLIN
          Mother...

Claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from
the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box.
Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.

                     CAITLIN
          You're such a morning person.

Claire turns at the door.

                     CLAIRE
          It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the
          plastic.

She starts to leave.  Caitlin calls out.

                     CAITLIN (O.S.)
          Blueberries!

Claire smiles as she closes the door behind her.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Claire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks.  When
she stands, something catches her eye out a window.  She
gazes down, transfixed.

ANGLE

Through a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG
COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door.
Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an
unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood
of their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of the
woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD.

A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out a
small gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire's
husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck.
He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks
beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him
look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the
prominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't take
her eyes off the scene below.

                     NORMAN
          They at it again?

Claire nods.

                     NORMAN
          Christ, that's twice in...When did they
          move in?

                     CLAIRE
          I think three...

                     NORMAN
          Three weeks.

She continues to gaze downward.  The man leans over the hood,
murmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Norman
the scene is entirely silent.

                     CLAIRE
          What's their name?

                     NORMAN
          Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures.
          They're all psychotic.

Outside, Mr. Feur turns and walks toward his house.  Norman
begins, once again, to nuzzle Claire.  Her eyes close, but
then she gently demurs.

                     CLAIRE
          She's awake.

                     NORMAN
          We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.

She turns to him.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't want to be either.

He smiles.  A really good smile.  The lips and tongue on his
faded T-shirt mark him as a 'Stones fan.

                     NORMAN
          When's she out of here?

                     CLAIRE
          Norman Spencer.

Norman gives up.  He busses her cheek.

                     NORMAN
               (moving toward the stairs)
          Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm
          going to class.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, I have to show up for the--

                     CLAIRE
          It's Saturday.

Norman stops.

                     NORMAN
          I knew that.  You think I didn't know
          that?

She smiles at him.  After a beat:

                     NORMAN
          It's today?

                     CLAIRE
               (wistfully)
          Yep.

They share a warm, poignant look.  He turns and moves down
the stairs.

                     NORMAN
               (calling over his shoulder)
          We're going to have to leave by three if
          we want to beat the traffic.

Claire returns her gaze to the scene below as Mr. Feur says
something ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Claire?

                     CLAIRE
               (absently)
          Three o'clock.

ANGLE

Mrs. Feur drops her face into her hands.

EXT.  SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

Claire peruses her "to do" list as Caitlin munches a panini.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and I still think we should get you
          some mittens.

Caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly.
The bond between them is palpable.

                     CLAIRE
          Do you have a scarf?

                     CAITLIN
          Hey.

Claire looks up from her little pad of paper.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes?

                     CAITLIN
          It's only two hours away.

                     CLAIRE
          I know that.

                     CAITLIN
          I'll come back all the time.

                     CLAIRE
          Of course you will.

                     CAITLIN
          I'm just saying, you're going to be
          fine.

Claire smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          Sweetheart, I've known this day was
          coming for a long time.  I've got your
          father and the garden and the new house.
          You really don't have to worry.

Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some
concern.  Claire takes her hand.

                     CLAIRE
          Really.

She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace.  Her
eyes close.

                     CAITLIN (V.O.)
          Mother...

EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY

Claire's frozen in the hug.

                     CAITLIN
               (beat)
          Mom.

Her eyes open.  Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on
the college campus.  The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the
background.

                     CAITLIN
          I have'ta go.

After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.  Caitlin
glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed
this overt display of maternal affection.

                     CAITLIN
          I'll call you.

Claire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her
daughter's hand.  It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS.

                     CLAIRE
          Come home anytime.

Caitlin looks at Norman.

                     NORMAN
          Really gonna leave me, huh?

She nods.  They share a tender look.

                     NORMAN
          Be good.

She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.  A bit
overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of
Caitlin's head.  After a moment, she steps back...

                     CAITLIN
          Bye.

...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old
Columbia dorm.  A banner is draped across its portals which
reads:

                  "WELCOME CLASS OF '04."

Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly
shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.  Her
eyes are shining.  Norman wraps an arm around her waist as
she daps at a tear with a Kleenex.

                     CLAIRE
               (smiling)
          I almost made it.

They turn and head for the car.  Claire sneaks one last look
over her shoulder.

ANGLE

Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton
nightgown.  Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes.

She gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him
and starts reading.  After a moment:

                     NORMAN
          Whatcha reading?

                     CLAIRE
               (reading the cover, sexy voice)
          Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic
          organisms.

                     NORMAN
               (slight smile)
          How is it?

Claire snuggles up.

                     CLAIRE
          Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells
          just gang divided a virginal cheerleader
          cell.

                     NORMAN
               (lost in his book)
          Nice.
               (beat)
          Almost done.

She pulls slightly away.

                     CLAIRE
          If you have to work...

                     NORMAN
          No, no.  I'm just about...
               (beat)
          There.

He places his book on the bedside table and turns to her.

                     NORMAN
          How are you?

                     CLAIRE
          Fine.

                     NORMAN
          It's okay if you're not.

                     CLAIRE
          I am, really.

                     NORMAN
          It's just she's been the focus for a
          while.

                     CLAIRE
          Not the focus.

                     NORMAN
          You know what I mean.

Claire thinks for a moment.

                     CLAIRE
          To tell you the truth...I'm
          excited.

                     NORMAN
          You are...

                     CLAIRE
          To get my life back.  To have some time
          for myself.  Some time for us.

He caresses her.

                     NORMAN
          You did a great job.  She's a good kid.

                     CLAIRE
          We did.

There's a weighty pause.

                     NORMAN
          It's just us now.

                     CLAIRE
          I know.

He kisses her.

                     NORMAN
          Tired?

                     CLAIRE
          Nope.

                     NORMAN
          Wanna fool around?

                     CLAIRE
          Yup.

They start to kiss.  It's slow and a bit methodical in the
manner of long time lovers.  Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN
WAILING can be heard.  They stop.

                     NORMAN
          Did you...

                     CLAIRE
          Shhh.

They listen.  The sounds start to become louder.  It is
clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and
savage love making.

                     NORMAN
          Jesus.

He walks over and closes the window.  It doesn't help.

                     NORMAN
          I guess they're making up.

The woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.

                     CLAIRE
          What is he doing to her?

They lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.

                     NORMAN
          And we moved out here for the quiet.

                     CLAIRE
          Mmm.

Beat.  The mood has passed.

                     NORMAN
          Maybe we should just...

                     CLAIRE
          Tomorrow.

                     NORMAN
          I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with
          Stan.

                     CLAIRE
          After that.

                     NORMAN
          I'll be there.

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Love you.

She smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          Night.

They lie together in the darkness as the Feurs finally
climax.

INT.  CAITLIN'S ROOM - DAY

Claire pushes open the door to Caitlin's room carrying an
armful of FOLDED LAUNDRY.  She moves quickly to the bureau,
not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINY
BLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer.  She's
just about to close it, when something catches her eye.

CLAIRE'S POV

She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old
JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer.
Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of
Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,
STUFFED ANIMALS.

She brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in
the smells.  She stares down at the word "Juilliard."

                                                MATCH CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - DAY

"JUILLIARD"...now it's on the same T-shirt only Claire's
wearing it and she's much younger.  It's an old photograph in
an album.  Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot, his
arm draped around her waist.  A CELLO CASE stands beside her.

Claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and
sees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE.  She gazes at
other photos.

-- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux
   with a very wide bow-tie.

-- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING.  A
   tiny Caitlin rests on her hip.

Claire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - DAY

Her face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the
immaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN.

The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.  She collapses
into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly,
she hears something coming from next door.

She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  It
is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makes
her way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes more
plaintive and fevered.

She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence
and tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out is
A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.  Claire gathers
her nerve and calls out...

                     CLAIRE
          Hello...

There's no reaction.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur?

The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.  The blue
shape vanishes from view.

                     CLAIRE
          Wait a minute.  I just want--

Something bumps against the fence.  Claire draws back.  She
hears heavy breathing.

                     MRS. FEUR
               (sniffling)
          Who are you?

                     CLAIRE
          It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From
          next door.  Is everything--

                     MRS. FEUR
          You're the flower lady.

                     CLAIRE
          Um...yes.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I've seen you.  From the window.

                     CLAIRE
          Is everything alright?

Claire leans closer to the tiny crack.  She sees a fleshy
blur and what might be part of an eye.  There's no response,
just the breathing.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?

                     MRS. FEUR
          I'm not...

She seems on the verge of losing it again.

                     MRS. FEUR
          He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I
          can't breath...

                     CLAIRE
          Who?  Your husband?

                     MRS. FEUR
          And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid
          of...

She trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          What?  What are you afraid of?

                     MRS. FEUR
          I can't, no, no, I can't...

Claire edges closer to the crack.

                     CLAIRE
          Tell me.  Please.

                     MRS. FEUR
          That I'll just...that one day I'll
          just...disappear.

Beat.  Claire's taken aback by this admission.

                     CLAIRE
          Tell me.  I can help you.

                     MRS. FEUR
          How?  How can you help me?  With your
          flowers and your perfect life...

                     CLAIRE
          That's not...It's not like that.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I've never even met you.

                     CLAIRE
          I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed
          with...my daughter left...for school.

                     MRS. FEUR
          This fence...it's so...

                     CLAIRE
          I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why
          don't you...

Tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into
the Feur's driveway.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please
          forget that I...I don't know what I'm
          saying.  Please...

                     CLAIRE
          Wait!  Don't go...

Claire listens to the sound of NAKED FOOTSTEPS, followed by a
LARGE FRONT DOOR swinging shut.  A CAR DOOR swings open and a
MAN'S SHOES follow down the path.

Claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence
as the door closes a second time.  She sits there for a
moment listening, but all is quiet.

                     CLAIRE (V.O.)
          She sounded terrified.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Claire and Norman eat dinner.  A rainstorm pelts the windows.

                     NORMAN
          Of what?

                     CLAIRE
          Of him I think.

                     NORMAN
          Did she say that?

                     CLAIRE
          More or less.

Norman chews.

                     NORMAN
          Honey, they're young.  They're probably
          newlyweds.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm telling you.  There was something in
          her voice...

                     NORMAN
          Remember how we were?

                     CLAIRE
          Not like this.  We were never like this.
               (beat)
          I want to go over there.  After dinner, we
          can--

                     NORMAN
          Why?

                     CLAIRE
          To make sure she's all right.

Norman puts down his fork.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, honey, we are not going to march
          next door and accuse our new neighbor of--

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          That's not what I'm sug--

                     NORMAN
          ...when tonight they'll probably be
          keeping us awake.

                     CLAIRE
          But what if something happens?

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
          I'd never be able to live with mysel--

                     NORMAN
               (reassuring)
          Nothing's going to happen.
               (beat)
          Besides, I have to work tonight.  The
          conference is in less than two weeks.
          I've got to stay focused on that for just
          a little longer.
               (beat)
          This is...

                     CLAIRE
          I know.

                     NORMAN
          It's what I've been working for.

She glances down at her untouched plate.

                     CLAIRE
          I just wish you could have heard her.

                     NORMAN
          Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych
          department, see what I can find out.

                     CLAIRE
          Promise?

He gives her a "Didn't I just say so" look.  She smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          I'll make you some coffee.

She reaches for his plate to clear it.  Norman grabs her hand
and kisses it.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Norman snores softly.  Claire is awakened by the continuing
STORM.  She pads out to Norman's turreted library.  Rain
pelts the glass.  Her face is briefly illuminated by the
LIGHTHOUSE BEAM.

She hears the sound of a DOOR CLOSING and moves to get a
better view of the Feur's.  Nothing but blackness.  Just as
she's turning to go back to bed.  A LIGHTNING FLASH lights up
the night.  Claire's eyes go wide.

CLAIRE'S POV

In the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, in
shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the
open trunk of his car.

                     CLAIRE
               (in a hoarse whisper)
          Norman!

He's dead to the world.  She calls to him again.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman, you have to look at this!

                     NORMAN
          Mmnph.

                     CLAIRE
          Hurry...

Another flash illuminates...Norman at her side.

                     CLAIRE
          Look!

...an EMPTY DRIVEWAY, then blackness.

                     NORMAN
          What is it?  What's the matter?

She stares down into the darkness.

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw
          something.

                     NORMAN
          Is it gone?

THE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway.  She nods.

                     NORMAN
          Come on, let's go back to bed.

Yet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at the
window.

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Claire sets up a camera and tripod.  She steps back and aims
her camera.  She glances up at a large upstairs window at the
FEUR'S HOUSE.  One side of the curtain seems to be pulled
open, but no one's there.

Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.  The
morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL
PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house.

She glances back at the Feur's window.  The CURTAIN IS NOW
CLOSED.

She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.
When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers
across the fence.  She can barely see over, but glimpses:

A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway.  Just then, a car
pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her
perch.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

Claire walks out to find her best friend, JODY, pretty, in
her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes.

                     CLAIRE
          Hey there.

Jody hugs her.

                     JODY
          How you holding up?

                     CLAIRE
          Good.  I'm good.

                     JODY
          You are?

                     CLAIRE
          Why does everyone find that so
          surprising?

                     JODY
               (are you kidding?)
          Cause...your...only daughter just went
          away to school...who you were incredibly
          close with aaand I'd be tripping...

                     CLAIRE
          Okay, I'm a little tender.

                     JODY
          Well good.  So you're human.

                     CLAIRE
          And so far my day has consisted of taking
          pictures of my roses for the garden club.

                     JODY
          Wow.  Got here just in time.
               (reaching into her bag)
          I brought you this.

She proffers several homemade tea bags.

                     CLAIRE
          What is it?

                     JODY
          Kambucha mushroom tea...

                     CLAIRE
          Jody--

                     JODY
          It soothes heart-ache and promotes
          psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--

                     CLAIRE
          You're discussing me with your psychic?

                     JODY
          She's not a psychic.  Just a very
          enlightened spirit.

                     CLAIRE
          Thanks, but I'm fine.

                     JODY
               (pressing it into her hand)
          So you'll have some later.
               (beat)
          Notice anything...different?

Claire gives her friend the once over, then notices the mint
Karman-Ghia behind her.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh my god.  You bought it.

                     JODY
          Yep.

                     CLAIRE
          It's niiice.

                     JODY
          Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband,
          get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up
          dudes?

                     CLAIRE
          Absolutely.

                     JODY
          Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought
          I'd stop by and see if you want to take
          the boat out, say Thursday morning?

                     CLAIRE
          You got it.

Jody grins.

                     JODY
          See you then.

Jody drives off.  Claire walks down the driveway to her front
door and sees Mr. Feur staring at her from a window.  She
starts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut.

Claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the
doorknob.  She stops.  A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard from
within.  Claire quietly opens the door and moves into:

INT.  FOYER - DAY

Claire stops inside the door.  Now it sounds like WHISPERING.
Two voices, tense, impassioned.  It seems to be coming from
Norman's study.  She gathers her nerve, then bursts into the
room.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

But the whispering has suddenly stopped.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?

The lovely circular room is completely empty.  She looks
around, puzzled.  Cooper, the family's aging lab, casually
ambles over.

                     CLAIRE
               (to Cooper)
          Please tell me you heard that.

EXT.  LAKE - DAY

Claire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at
the water's edge.  Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who
bolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK.  Claire gazes at the
LIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance.
Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water.

Claire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the dark
water.

                     CLAIRE
          Cooper...what do you see?

She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.
After a moment, she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly in
the reflection of her face.  Cooper rumbles a low growl.  The
shape seems to be gaining definition.

RRRING!

Claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her
sweater and pulls out a cordless phone.

                     CLAIRE
               (into phone)
          Hi.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
               (on the other end)
          I'm stuck here for another couple of
          hours.

Claire's smile fades.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          Unless you need me to come home...

                     CLAIRE
          No, no.  It's fine.

Claire slowly leans out over the water to check her
reflection...

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          You sure?

...but the shape is gone.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          Claire?

                     CLAIRE
          Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.

She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire sits in a small workroom at a computer.  She focuses
intently on the screen.

ANGLE

It's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE.  She flips the last card and
an animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of
musical notes, parades across the screen.

                     QUEEN OF HEARTS
               (on computer)
          You lost!  Off with your head!

Claire hits "New Game" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber
solitaire is dealt.  She suddenly has a thought and
disappears into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

She glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of
red wine.  She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves
into:

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She dials a number.  LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through
the phone.

                     CLAIRE
               (straining to be heard)
          Hello?  I'm looking for Caitlin Spencer.
          She's in 314...Well, could you check?

She plugs one ear.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.  Well, just tell her that her mother
          called.  Her mother.  Thank you.  Excuse
          me, how can you study with that?

The noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone and
replaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to a
classical music station.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then
hears a different set of musical notes from the computer.
She stares at the screen, stunned.

ANGLE

The game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarm
chaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN!

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.  Kay.

Without warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past
several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish
rock and roll.

                     CLAIRE
          Jesus...

She bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music is
chaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...no
one.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts down
the hall.  She follows him.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

The foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  Claire
nervously walks out and looks around.

                     CLAIRE
          Cooper!

POV - THE GARDEN

No sign of the dog.

Claire turns to go back inside.  When she touches the
doorknob, she hears the whispering again.  A fleeting shadow
draws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly
into the study.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello...?!

The whispering stops.

INT.  NORMAN'S LAB - NIGHT

Claire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRAD
STUDENTS.  At school he's a very different man; pressed shirt
and tie, hair neatly brushed back.  They're preforming some
unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness.
She stops by the door to watch him.

                     NORMAN
          ...and then what...Courtney?

An intense ASIAN GIRL answers.

                     COURTNEY
          We administer the Halothane.

                     NORMAN
          Dosage?

She glances at her notes.

                     COURTNEY
          Three point five cc's.

                     NORMAN
          Excellent.  Properties?  Andrew from
          downtown...

Andrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this.

                     ANDREW
          An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent,
          which when administered in aerosol form
          temporarily renders the subject immobile.

                     NORMAN
          Nothing but net.

He measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an
apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep.

                     NORMAN
          Prudence here's an old friend.

He moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to
Courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus.  The sheep
suddenly goes completely still.  Norman moves around and
begins a brief procedure.

                     NORMAN
          I try to stay on her good side because I
          owe her my career and most of our grant
          money.  Why else?

He completes the procedure.  They look at him blankly.

                     NORMAN
          Always do unto others as you'd have
          others do unto your ewe.

Groans, laughter.  He stops Claire.

                     NORMAN
          That'll do it.  Write this up for Tuesday!

Andrew and Amy tend to Prudence, the rest leave.  Claire
moves over to him.  They kiss.  Norman packs notes and some
of the chemicals into a LEATHER CASE.

                     NORMAN
               (warm)
          What are you doing here?

                     CLAIRE
          There were some noises.  I didn't want to
          disturb you.

She watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led
out of the room.

                     NORMAN
          What do you mean?  Some noises where?

                     CLAIRE
          In the house.  I was scared.

                     NORMAN
          Did you call the police?

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you
          back in the morning.

                     NORMAN
          Of course.

He takes her arm.

INT.  THE FOYER - NIGHT

Norman pushes open the front door.  Cooper pads over, wagging
his tail.  They walk together past the stereo into...

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

...the living room.  All is quiet.  They move into...

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

It's undisturbed.  Norman checks the window locks.

                     CLAIRE
          It was there.  This angry music all by
          itself.  And I heard whispering.

                     NORMAN
          What kind of whispering?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.  Just...whispering.

He nods as Cooper appears.

                     NORMAN
          What'd you see, Coop?

The dog stares blankly.

                     CLAIRE
               (to Cooper)
          Tell him!

Norman smiles.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Norman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes.

                     NORMAN
          I'm gonna have the police check on the
          house.

Claire leans against the window sill.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh great, "Can you look in on my wife,
          she's hearing voices?"  Wait'll that gets
          around.

He walks over to her.

                     NORMAN
          I've got the conference next week.  I want
          you to feel safe.

                     CLAIRE
          I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how
          was your day?

He goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box
in his dresser.

                     NORMAN
          Think I may have cracked it.

                     CLAIRE
          Really?

She produces a match and lights it.  They sit on the bed.

                     NORMAN
          I think so.  Maybe.

                     CLAIRE
          You are so brilliant.

                     NORMAN
          Yep.

                     CLAIRE
          Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman
          Spencer...

                     NORMAN
               (smiling)
          You know what that does to me.

She takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck.

                     NORMAN
               (stopping)
          Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw
          Schumway...

                     CLAIRE
          You're kidding.

                     NORMAN
          He's here giving some arcane spiel for
          the physics department, so Bob Shine
          introduces us...

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.

He nods, Claire passes the joint back.

                     NORMAN
          And he says...you'll fucking love this,
          he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great
          admirer of your work..."

                     CLAIRE
          Well, that's nice.

                     NORMAN
          "...especially Spencer's Theorem..."

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          Oh, no...

                     NORMAN
          "...of Perpetual Distances."
               (beat)
          Everybody's checking their shoelaces.
          Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken
          me,"  I say...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          That's...

                     NORMAN
          "...for my father."

                     CLAIRE
          I'm so sorry.

                     NORMAN
          Didn't know he was dead, every stinking
          paper on the globe.

                     CLAIRE
          That's just mean.
               (indicating joint)
          Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get
          her some.

                     NORMAN
               (quickly glancing over)
          Did you tell her?

                     CLAIRE
          What?  No.  No.

                     NORMAN
          You didn't?

                     CLAIRE
               (with a smile)
          Norman, you are so funny about that.  No,
          I didn't.

He takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Cause that would be really--

She lays back on the bed.  Sounds of flushing.

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't.

He reappears without the joint.

                     NORMAN
          Sorry.  You understand.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you call about the Feurs?

                     NORMAN
          Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a
          sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.

                     CLAIRE
          Huh.

Claire ponders this.  Norman turns off the light and joins
her on the bed.  He kisses her knee.

                     NORMAN
          Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more.

Then starts working his way up her thigh.

                     NORMAN
          And speak up.

Claire smiles.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in
position.  After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow
to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound.

Claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a
beautiful and melancholy piece of music.  She's very, very
good.  Eyes closed.  Her body begins to sway slightly as her
left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck.

She reaches a difficult transition and falters.  She seems
almost surprised.  She attacks the transition again, and
again falters.  Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet
again, this time failing completely.

She sits back in the chair, despondent.  Almost as an
afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings.  At the
end of the tone, something catches her ear.  She can just
make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone.

She sits up and plays a different note, then another.  Each
time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct.  Finally
she plays a sharp, higher pitched note.  The voice echoes
with a distinct, unsettling shriek.

CRASH!

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DUSK

Claire walks in and sees:

INSERT-- Lying on the floor...A FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH
OF NORMAN AND CLAIRE.

The caption announces that he's being promoted to the
"distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS."  Through the
spiderwebbed glass, Norman can be seen shaking hands with an
older academic, hugging a smiling Claire to his side.

Claire kneels down to gather the picture.  A single shard of
glass is missing.  She finds it a foot away by a distinctive
knot in the wood floor.

She notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass, but when
she moves it, it's gone.  She places the pieces of broken
glass on the frame and stands.

Out of the window directly in front of her sees:  Mr. Feur,
removing a DIRT COVERED SHOVEL from his trunk.  She glances
down at the picture, then back up at Mr. Feur, who carries
the shovel around back.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh no...

Claire wraps up the broken picture.  She hears a car door
slam and glances out the window in time to see Mr. Feur
driving off.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

A stiff autumn breeze.  Claire stands at the fence.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur?

She looks through the tiny crack.  Nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?
               (beat)
          Are you there?

Silence.

EXT.  THE FEUR'S - DAY

Claire glances down as she walks past THE FURROW.  She looks
up at the house, which seems quite placid, then slowly heads
around back.

EXT.  FEUR'S BACK PORCH - DAY

She takes in the lake view from the large porch.  The wind is
really blowing.  Her eye catches on something.  Propped
against the back door...

THE SOIL COVERED SHOVEL

Claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it,
then knocks at the back door.  There's no answer.  She knocks
again.  Nothing.  She's turning to go, then the door swings
open.  The smile fades from Claire's face.

CLAIRE'S POV

The immense MR. FEUR filling the doorway.

                     MR. FEUR
          Yes?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...

                     MR. FEUR
          I'm running late here.  I just came back
          for my briefcase.

                     CLAIRE
          Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to
          welcome you to the uh, to the
          neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From
          next door.

                     MR. FEUR
          This really isn't a good time.

He starts to close the door.

                     CLAIRE
          Well maybe your wife...

                     MR. FEUR
               (growing cold)
          She isn't here.

                     CLAIRE
          When...when will she be back?

                     MR. FEUR
          I don't know.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh-kay...

                     MR. FEUR
          I have to go.

Slam.  And Claire is staring at a closed door.

                     JODY (V.O.)
          What do you mean she's gone?

EXT.  LAKE - DAY

Claire and Jody knife slowly through the water in the
Spencer's sailboat heading back toward the dock, the OLD
LIGHTHOUSE, the BRIDE in the background.

                     CLAIRE
          She's not there.  I haven't seen her since
          that morning.  Well, I mean, I've never
          actually seen her, but I'm telling you,
          she's disappeared.

Jody finishes securing a line.  The breeze is mild, so they
just cruise with the wind.

                     JODY
          What are you saying?

Claire just looks at her.

                     JODY
          You think he killed her?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds
          crazy.  But what else could it all be?

Jody shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I mean, he's so kind of grim and
          daunting, and she sounded terrified of
          something.

Claire glances over at Jody.

                     CLAIRE
               (laughing to herself)
          Listen to me.  I sound like some middle-
          aged Nancy Drew.

Jody regards her.  After a beat:

                     JODY
          Know what I think?

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     JODY
          Seance.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, no...

                     JODY
          Telling you...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          ...no...no...no...

                     JODY
          Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.

                     CLAIRE
          Please.  That's all I need.

Jody shrugs, "Have it your way."  Beat.

                     JODY
          Hey, look.

CLAIRE'S HOUSE across the lake.

                     JODY
          So pretty.

CLAIRE'S POV

A FIGURE in the turreted window of Norman's study.

                     CLAIRE
          Someone's there.

                     JODY
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          In the window.  Norman's at work.

                     JODY
          I don't...

Claire looks over at Jody.

                     CLAIRE
               (pointing)
          There.  In the study.  Don't you see--

She looks again-- nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.  I'm losing it.

                     JODY
          No, you're not.
               (beat)
          But a presence in your house is not
          something to be taken lightly.

Claire stares back at the house.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Claire walks in and sets down some packages.  She opens one
and pulls out new toothpaste and...AN ENVELOPE-- the kind
your pictures come back in.  She absently leafs through them,
then freezes.  She gapes at one of the shots.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh boy...

INT.  UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

Claire turns off the lights and crouches down.  She raises a
pair of BINOCULARS.

POV - BINOCULARS

Claire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house...past
their car parked in front until she finds A LIGHT ON
DOWNSTAIRS.

The tall, powerfully built Mr. Feur walks into the room and
sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for
one.  He eats a TV dinner, slowly chewing and staring
straight ahead.  He sips from a can of beer.

Just then...A HAND GRABS CLAIRE'S ARM.  She lets out a
screech and turns to see Norman standing beside her.

                     NORMAN
          What are you doing?

She glances back out the window and sees Mr. Feur standing
at the window, paging the curtain.  She squats down, pulling
Norman with her.

                     CLAIRE
               (shrill whisper)
          Get down!  He'll see.

                     NORMAN
               (also whispers)
          What's going on, Claire?

                     CLAIRE
          Shhhh.

She peers over the sill in time to see Mr. Feur turning away
from the window.  She takes Norman by the hand and leads him
downstairs.

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

She leads Norman in.

                     NORMAN
               (still whispering)
          Why am I...
               (full voice)
          Why am I whispering in my own house?

Claire turns.

                     CLAIRE
          He killed her.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          He did.  She's in the picture.  I went
          over to look and she's gone.  The table
          was set for one.

                     NORMAN
          And that means he murdered his wife?
          This is getting ridic--

                     CLAIRE
          No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel,
          his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from
          here, believe me, I...
               (frustrated, she grabs the
                photos)
          All right, look at this.

She triumphantly thrusts one before him.  Norman looks at it.

                     NORMAN
          Our house.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Look!  In the window.

The ROSES.  She points out a HAZY FIGURE in the TURRETED
WINDOW of the study.  Norman takes it over to the light.

                     NORMAN
          It's a flare.

                     CLAIRE
          A flare?

                     NORMAN
          From the sun.  It's a reflection on the
          glass.

                     CLAIRE
          It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered
          and turned on the music.  She's trying to
          contact me!

                     NORMAN
               (making sure he's got it)
          It's a ghost.

Norman shakes his head.  He looks again at the picture, does
a quick calculation.

                     NORMAN
          You took this in the morning, didn't you?

She nods slightly.

                     NORMAN
          When the sun would be exactly right.

She's got him.

                     CLAIRE
          Then why isn't it in any of the other
          pictures?

She thrusts the batch at him.  He peruses the other few shots
of the garden.

                     NORMAN
          A cloud passed.  Or it's a bounce off the
          lake.  See?

She looks.  He might not be wrong.

                     CLAIRE
          Where is she then?

                     NORMAN
          She could be out.  She could be sick in
          bed for all we know.

                     CLAIRE
          Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at
          this.

She leads him out of the room.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire stares at the computer screen triumphantly.

                     CLAIRE
          See?

                     NORMAN
          What am I looking at?

                     CLAIRE
               (indicating completed solitaire
                game)
          I didn't do that.

                     NORMAN
          Who did?  Mrs. Feur?

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe.  Point is...not me.

                     NORMAN
          Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed
          her, why doesn't she haunt him?

                     CLAIRE
          She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman,
          I know how it looks, but--

                     NORMAN
          Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under
          some strain.  But there's no such thing as
          ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor
          did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why
          aren't you dressed?

                     CLAIRE
          Dressed?

                     NORMAN
          Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.

                     CLAIRE
          When?

                     NORMAN
          What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about
          it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our
          first date since...

                     CLAIRE
               (she seems confused)
          Oh.

                     NORMAN
          ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember
          this?

                     CLAIRE
          Tonight?

                     NORMAN
          Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--

She looks at his watch.

                     CLAIRE
          Fashionably five minutes late.

She bolts up the stairs.

INT.  NORMAN'S PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

They drive across the bridge.

                     NORMAN
               (concerned, exasperated)
          When you do this, I swear...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          ...Don't get all...

                     NORMAN
          ...like it never even happened...

                     CLAIRE
          Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...

He pulls out a cell phone and punches in a number.

                     CLAIRE
          What are you doing?

                     NORMAN
          Restaurant.  Let them know we're running
          late.

                     CLAIRE
          Five minutes?

The phone flashes..."NO SERVICE."

                     CLAIRE
          You're not at the center.

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          I know I'm not at the center of the
          bridge.

                     CLAIRE
          We're going to be fine.

They near the far side of the bridge.  Norman looks down at
the cell phone, which now reads, "ROAM."  He presses a
button.

                     NORMAN
          There we go.

                     CLAIRE
          Well, that's a relief.

He shoots her a look.

INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A cozy, candlelit Italian place in town.  Claire and Norman
arrive at the table.  STAN rises.  The chair next to him is
empty.  He kisses her cheek.

                     CLAIRE
          Hi Stan.  Sorry we're late.
               (too earnest)
          It was my fault.

She greets Stan, a friendly looking man in his forties.

                     STAN
          We just got here.

Claire flashes a semi-playful look back at Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          Where's the new squeeze?

A VOICE speaks out from behind her.

                     VOICE
          Here I am.

Claire turns to find A TALL, ELEGANT BRUNETTE standing behind
her.  The woman's face registers some shock.

                     STAN
          I'd like you to meet...

                     CLAIRE
          Elena?

                     ELENA
          Ohmigod...

The two women embrace, then beam at each other.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.

                     ELENA
          This is...

                     CLAIRE
               (to Norman)
          We know each other.

                     NORMAN
          Hope so.

LATER

Post meal.  Several empty wine bottle decorate the table.

                     ELENA
          We had this Finnish conductor, Aki, Laki,
          something.  He had these ridiculous bangs.
          And he'd sweep them off with his baton
          every minute or so, and it drove us
          insane, remember?

Claire nods.

                     CLAIRE
          He looked like one of the Monkees.

                     ELENA
          Anyway, Claire slept with him...

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't sleep with him.

                     ELENA
          ...just so she could cut them off.

                     CLAIRE
          He was so pissed.

                     ELENA
          I came in from my room...

                     CLAIRE
               (interjecting)
          We were suite mates.

                     ELENA
          And there's this brilliant conductor in
          purple briefs with no bangs cursing his
          ass off in Finnish.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...

They dissolve into giggles.  Norman and Stan smile.

                     STAN
          Well...

                     NORMAN
               (to Stan)
          I made an honest woman out of her.

Elena puts her hand on Claire's.

                     ELENA
               (to Stan)
          You should have heard her play.

                     CLAIRE
          Stop.

                     ELENA
          We both auditioned for the Philharmonic.
          One cello position open.

                     CLAIRE
          Do we have to?

                     ELENA
          And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I
          stood in the hallway and listened to her
          audition...and I cried.

                     CLAIRE
          She's making this up.

                     ELENA
          I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for
          weeks.

                     STAN
          What happened?

Elena looks at Claire, then smiles.

                     ELENA
          She got it.
               (beat)
          Turned it down.

                     CLAIRE
          I met a dashing young grad student after a
          recital one night...

Claire puts her arm around Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and three months later I was married.

He squeezes her hand.

INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY

Claire walks into the work room with the portable phone to
her ear and a cup of Jody's special tea.  She sniffs it and
makes a face as she turns on the computer.  After several
rings a GIRL picks up on the other end.

                     CLAIRE
               (on phone)
          Caitlin?

                     GIRL'S VOICE
               (overlapping)
          Can you hang up?  I'm trying to make a
          call.

The line goes dead.  Claire hits redial and gets...a BUSY
SIGNAL.  She clicks the phone off as the computer boots up.
Claire puts the phone down and starts a game of Alice's
Solitaire.  She turns a card and waits.

                     CLAIRE
          Gee, that's tricky.  Sure could use some
          help.

She waits, the cursor blinks benignly.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on...

Nothing happens.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAY

She walks into the room and notices STEAM wafting from the
cracked bathroom door.

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

Claire enters the steamy bathroom.  The tub is nearly
overflowing with water.  She squats down to drain the tub.

She stops, feeling watched, then slowly peers behind her...no
one's there.  Claire reaches toward the water to yank the
plug's chain, then freezes.  In the bathwater's still
reflection she see:

A PRETTY YOUNG BLOND standing beside her.  Startled, she pops
up and slams into the SHOWER HEAD.

Claire collapses over the side of the tub, her head dipping
underwater.  A small cloud of red surrounds her.  Moments
later, an arm wraps around her.

                                                      CUT TO:

Blurry shapes.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Claire...

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

CLAIRE'S POV - A FACE sharpens into focus hovering above
her...Norman.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Claire sits on the bed.  Norman dabs the blood from a tiny
cut on the back of her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't need a shrink.

                     NORMAN
               (gently)
          Harvey says he's amazing.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman...

                     NORMAN
          What can it hurt to talk to someone?

She goes to her dresser and gets a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and
starts to open it.  Norman gently places a hand on her arm.

                     NORMAN
          Please.

She shoots him a look...

                     NORMAN
          You promised.

...and puts the pills down.

                     NORMAN
               (gently)
          Claire, she's been a huge part of your
          life for seventeen years.  If you weren't
          thrown off balance by this, then
          something would be wrong.

                     CLAIRE
          I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course
          I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I
          know what I saw and what I heard...and it
          wasn't some "symptom" of something...

                     NORMAN
          I never said...

                     CLAIRE
          ...and I don't think I'm some lonely,
          middle-aged woman cracking up.

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Are you lonely?

                     CLAIRE
          No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!

INT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in
her lap, arms crossed.

                     DR. DRAYTON (O.S.)
               (a smooth, mellifluous
                baritone)
          Who's idea was it?

                     CLAIRE
          Mine.  His.  We both...thought...

She trails off.  Camera slowly pulls back to reveal, DR.
TIMOTHY DRAYTON, a stocky, light skinned black man in his
late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't want to come.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Then why did you?

                     CLAIRE
          Because he was worried about me.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Your husband?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.
               (beat)
          I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full
          of prozac so he can live out his life in
          peace.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you really think so?

                     CLAIRE
          No.

There's a pause.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Why is he worried?

                     CLAIRE
          Because, I don't know, because
          sometimes...sometimes I forget
          things...and ever since Caitlin left,
          ever since my daughter left for school,
          there've been...I fainted and...
               (beat)
          Why is this so hard?

Dr. Drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red
FIREBALLS next to his chair.  He proffers it to Claire.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fireball?

                     CLAIRE
          You're joking.

He shakes his head.  She shrugs, then grabs one and pops it
into her mouth.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          It's hard because I'm a complete stranger
          and what we're talking about is
          incredibly personal.  Besides, the first
          time most people come here, a part of
          them is wondering if I'm gonna think
          they're crazy.

She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Don't worry, I'm required to have at
          least three sessions in order to commit.

Her eyes get a little wider.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Now that's a joke.

She manages an unsteady smile.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          I have some training at helping people
          through the stressful moments in life,
          one of which you may or may not be
          experiencing.  If you want to get some
          stuff off your chest, great.  If not...

He smiles and shrugs, "no problem."  She stares at him for a
moment.

                     CLAIRE
               (re: fireball)
          These are good.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Mm-hmm.

She studies him for a moment.

                     CLAIRE
          There's a ghost in my house.

He nods slightly, as if she's told him, "I have some
anxiety."  Claire goes on.

                     CLAIRE
          She finished my solitaire game and turned
          on the radio...she likes rock and roll.
          Angry rock and roll.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          How do you know it's a she?

                     CLAIRE
          I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She
          was filling the bathtub.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What does she look like?

                     CLAIRE
          Pretty.  She's a blond.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you have any idea who she is?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fine.

                     CLAIRE
          What do you think I should do?

He thinks for a moment, then:

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Try to contact her.

Claire nearly swallows her fireball.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Try to communicate with her somehow.

                     CLAIRE
          You think that'll help?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Can't hurt.  And I think it's important
          you find out what she wants.

Claire ponders this for a moment, then looks back up at him.

                     CLAIRE
          Are you humoring me?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Nope.

She seems satisfied by his sincerity.

                     CLAIRE
          How?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          I don't know.  My aunt used to use my
          uncle's old pajamas and a candle.

He stands.  Claire nods, then stands.  She smiles too.

                     CLAIRE
          Is this time okay?

He nods.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks in carrying a half-empty bottle of wine.  She
looks over at Jody, who turns off the lights.  Jody then
strikes a match and lights a LARGE CANDLE.  She unveils her
carved ANTIQUE OUIJA BOARD.

                     JODY
          Sit down here.

                     CLAIRE
               (nervous, jokey)
          Are we hoping the ghost is going to
          have to pee?

Jody turns to her, deadly serious.

                     JODY
          Isn't this where you saw her?

Claire's smile fades.  She nods.

                     JODY
          Then this is where she'll be.

They sit cross legged, the board between them.

                     JODY
          Place your fingers on the planchette.

                     CLAIRE
          The planchette?

                     JODY
          This.

Jody indicates the wooden pointing device.  Each woman grasps
an edge.

                     JODY
               (in a low voice)
          We wish to commune with the spirit of
          Mrs. Feur.
               (to Claire)
          What's her first name?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

Jody closes her eyes.  Claire follows suit.

                     JODY
          I call forth the entity that is haunting
          this house.

They look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved.

                     JODY
          Mrs. Feur?

There's still no movement.

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing's happening.

                     JODY
          Shhh.

Jody focuses intently.
                     JODY
          Reveal yourself to us.

A long moment passes.  It's starting to seem like a bust.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.  Even Jody seems startled.

                     JODY
               (to the spirit)
          Who...who are you?

At first, nothing happens.  Then, slowly, the planchette
starts to move across the board.

                     CLAIRE
          Are you doing that?

Jody shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not doing that.

The planchette comes to rest on the letter "M."  Moments
later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on
"E."

                     CLAIRE
          Oh...

                     JODY
          M-E...

It starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space
between "E" and "F."  The planchette stops on "F."  Jody
removes her fingers from the device.

                     JODY
          Mef?  What's Mef?

                     CLAIRE
          It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.

Suddenly, the CANDLE starts flickering strangely and THE
PLANCHETTE SLIDES JERKILY ON ITS OWN...M-E-F, M-E-F...

                     JODY
          Shit...

Jody stumbles backwards, gasping.

                     JODY
          Did you see that?

Claire leans in.

                     CLAIRE
               (to ghost)
          What happened to you?

The CANDLE GOES OUT.

                     JODY
          Oh God...

Jody bolts.  Claire follows.

EXT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Claire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the
work room.  She holds onto her arm.

                     JODY
          I have to go.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, wait.

Cooper's growling in the work room.  They look in.

                     JODY
          Claire, this is...this is...

Claire, transfixed, walks in.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She stares at the computer screen, which is being filled with
letters at an amazing speed.

MEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEF...

She hears the front door swing open.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody!

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

Claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the
Karman-Ghia tearing out of the driveway.  She turns and goes
back into the house.

CRASH!

She edges into...

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

The picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot.  She
drops to her knees over the picture.  This time THE GLASS IS
SHATTERED.  When she picks out the remaining shards, the
newspaper photo slides out.  Claire glances at the benign
news stories on the back.

She looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack
in the floor boards by the knot.

CLAIRE'S POV

The piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like A COPPER
COIN in the crack.  It's too big to be a penny.

She tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but
recoils.  A tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which
she pops into her mouth.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Still sucking on her finger, Claire walks in and begins to
clean up the remains of the seance.  She bends down to pick
up the Ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub
is again full to the brink of overflowing.

                     CLAIRE
          What do you want?!

Claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply.
There is only silence.  She reaches in to pull the plug,
nearly scalding her hand.  When she turns for a hand towel
she finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror:

                      "YOU KNOW"

She draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.

EXT.  LAB BUILDING - NIGHT

Norman nods to a SECURITY GUARD as he leaves a darkened
university building.  He sees Claire standing at the foot of
the steps.

                     NORMAN
          What are you doing out here?

                     CLAIRE
          He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed
          her and--

                     NORMAN
          This is the Feur thing?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.

Norman's momentarily speechless.

                     NORMAN
          How do you know this?

                     CLAIRE
          We had a seance.

                     NORMAN
          Who did?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman,
          she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to
          leave.

                     NORMAN
          How did you--

                     CLAIRE
          Jody brought a Ouija board and we
          summoned her.

He regards her for a moment.

                     NORMAN
          Are you angry at me?

This stops Claire in her tracks.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     NORMAN
          Maybe you resent how busy I've been.

                     CLAIRE
          What are you...?  No.

                     NORMAN
          You know what I've got at stake with this
          paper.  You know that.  I can't help but
          think that you're doing this now to hurt
          me, or to sabotage me somehow.

                     CLAIRE
          Sabotage?

                     NORMAN
          Ever since the accident I've been
          worried that you'd been unhappy, or...

                     CLAIRE
          The accident...?

                     NORMAN
          But then you've been so much better...

                     CLAIRE
          Norman, this isn't about you.  This is
          something that's happening to me.  It's
          not to get even...and it's not some
          warped bid for attention.  Some strange
          things are happening in our house,
          whether you believe in them or not...

                     NORMAN
          Sweetheart--

                     CLAIRE
          No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in
          what's happening.  I don't want to, but I
          do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think
          that would be enough for you.

She turns on a heel and walks toward her car.

EXT.  CAMPUS - NIGHT

Norman catches up to her as a LARGE CROWD is filing out of
the concert hall next door.

                     NORMAN
          You're overreacting.

She turns on him.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't tell me how to react!

Norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk.

                     NORMAN
          Keep your voice down.

                     CLAIRE
          I will NOT.

Some of the bystanders stop to watch.

                     CLAIRE
               (still loud)
          Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my
          mind...

                     NORMAN
               (looking around)
          Claire, please...

Claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her
intensity.

                     CLAIRE
          ...But what if I'm not?  What if she died
          in terror and betrayal and some part of
          her can't move on while that's
          unresolved.  Can't you just...

Something behind him catches her eye.  She trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow...

Claire walks past him toward the parking lot.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, please...

There's a dangerous energy to her walk.  People step out of
the way.

EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Claire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's
after.  MR. FEUR steps out from behind the open trunk of his
old Buick.

                     CLAIRE
               (walking up)
          You!

He looks up at her.

                     CLAIRE
          You think you're smart, don't you?  You
          think you got away clean.  Well, I know
          you killed her.  You drowned her in the
          bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and
          I'm gonna find her, you murdering
          sonofabitch.

Mr. Feur stares, dazed, through the tirade.  Norman arrives
at her side.

                     MR. FEUR
          Who?

                     CLAIRE
               (scoffing)
          Give me that shit.  Your wife.

                     MR. FEUR
          I didn't kill my wife.

                     NORMAN
               (to Mr. Feur)
          I'm sorry...

                     CLAIRE
               (over Norman)
          Then where is she?

He stares at both Spencers for a moment.  Then calls past
them.

                     MR. FEUR
          Honey...

Claire and Norman turn.  A BLOND WOMAN backs out of the
passenger seat.  She turns.  IT'S NOT THE FACE CLAIRE HAS
SEEN.  Claire looks sucker punched.

INT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Claire sits back in the chair.  She looks drained.  A soft
rain taps against the windows.

                     CLAIRE
          And his face...it seemed so gentle, and I
          knew...in that second I knew that I'd
          imagined the whole thing.

Dr. Drayton takes this in.  She seems genuinely frightened.

                     CLAIRE
          What's happening to me?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Well, that's what we're here for.

He watches her calmly, some empathy on his face.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Whether you imagined it or not, you
          actually saw and heard things that
          frightened you...that gave you reason for
          concern.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes, but...

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Your friend saw them.

                     CLAIRE
          Isn't there something called group
          hysteria?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You think you influenced her?

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that
          when all this was happening, I felt, some
          part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody
          needed me.  And the more I reached out to,
          it, the fuller it became.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You're saying you willed these events to
          happen?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know, I'm very confused right
          now.

Beat.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Did you ever find out what it wanted?

Claire remembers.

                     CLAIRE
          She said, "You know."  That I know.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you?

                     CLAIRE
          No.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What do you think?
               (beat)
          Guess.

Claire ponders this.

                     CLAIRE
          I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by
          someone.
               (beat)
          This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the
          emotions of a figment of my--

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Have you been hurt?

                     CLAIRE
          Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was
          injured, but...

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You were in an accident?

                     CLAIRE
          Last year.  I drove my car up a tree.
          Nothing serious, this...
               (she indicates her scar)
          ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked
          bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it
          scared the hell out of Norman.

Beat.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          How's your marriage?

Claire's eyes widen.

                     CLAIRE
          Listen, don't hold back.

Dr. Drayton smiles kindly.

                     CLAIRE
          Well, he's been amazing throughout this
          whole thing.  Patient and caring...
               (beat)
          I mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his
          work, and...it's a very important time
          right now with all that.  But,
          sometimes...I mean with everybody, right?
          Sometimes it's like...

She trails off.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          That he doesn't...see me, or, you know,
          that I'm...that's something's wrong...with
          me.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          That can't feel good.

                     CLAIRE
          No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what
          you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry,
          but that's not it.  My marriage is fine.
          I've had some kind of "empty-nest"
          episode where I saw some things that
          weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm
          willing to deal with that.
               (beat)
          I just don't want to go conjuring
          problems where none exist.

Claire finishes her tirade.  Dr. Drayton lets her settle for
a moment.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fair enough.  But you should know that I'm
          far less concerned with whether things
          you saw "existed," than I am with why you
          saw them.

She takes in the ramifications of that.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire's carrying some cuttings into the house.  She hears a
knock at the gate, walks over and opens it to discover...Mrs.
Feur.  The real one.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I wanted to apologize.

                     CLAIRE
          You do?

                     MRS. FEUR
          For scaring you like I did.  When I
          thought about what that must have seemed
          like that day...

                     CLAIRE
          And then you weren't there.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Right.  I'm sorry.

There's an awkward pause.

                     CLAIRE
          Would you like some iced tea?

                     MRS. FEUR
          Very much.

Claire leads her toward the house.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire pours Mrs. Feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher.
She's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Your house is so beautiful.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you.

                     MRS. FEUR
          And these roses.  They're much prettier
          up close.

She regards Mrs. Feur for a moment.  She seems skittish and
shy.

                     CLAIRE
          I...there's something I have to ask
          you.

Mrs. Feur waits.

                     CLAIRE
          That day...at the fence.  You seemed
          terrified.  I don't think I was imagining
          that.

There's a pause.  Mrs. Feur looks down into her lap.

                     MRS. FEUR
          No.

                     CLAIRE
          Of what?  What were you so afraid of?

                     MRS. FEUR
          You're going to think I'm crazy or
          something.

A tiny smile.

                     CLAIRE
          Not this week.

She looks away for a moment, then looks back at Claire.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Love.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     MRS. FEUR
          Have you ever felt so completely consumed
          by a feeling for someone that you
          couldn't breathe?  That the time together
          is so passionate and consuming that you
          felt physical pain when they would leave?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...sure.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a
          metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I
          never dreamed anyone would hear me back
          there...
               (beat)
          I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's
          in Boston.  He brought my things up and
          pleaded with me to come home.

Claire is mesmerized.

                     MRS. FEUR
          You must think I'm pathetic.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  No, I don't.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I'm sorry that I frightened you like
          that.  But I was so touched by your
          concern.  I've been lonely here.
               (beat)
          Perhaps we could be friends.

Claire stares at this strange, passionate woman.

                     CLAIRE
          I would like that.

Mrs. Feur smiles at her.

INT.  VOLVO - NIGHT

Claire pulls up in front of a large NEW YORK HOTEL.

                     NORMAN
               (on a cell phone)
          ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for
          dinner.
               (to Claire)
          Sure you won't stay?

                     CLAIRE
          No, it's fine.  I'm fine.

                     NORMAN
               (tempting her)
          Really big bed.

She smiles and shakes her head.  Norman kisses her goodbye,
then grabs his bag from the backseat.

                     NORMAN
          Do I have everything?

                     CLAIRE
          Yep.

                     NORMAN
          Call ya later.

He starts to walk into the hotel.

                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
          And you glad you married me?

He turns.  She's standing next to the car.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Are you glad?  I'm glad.

Norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand.

                     NORMAN
               (softly)
          You know I am.

                     CLAIRE
          Good.
               (She gazes at him, then
                softly)
          You sat in front...I saw you there...

Norman takes his cue.

                     NORMAN
          You were lost in the music...eyes
          closed...your chest heaving...

                     CLAIRE
          I felt you...looking through me...

                     NORMAN
          We walked all night...

                     CLAIRE
          You told me that I was...

He gently cups her chin in his hand.

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          ...that you were everything I'd ever
          dreamed of.

She smiles, kisses him warmly, then gets in the car.

EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Claire stands outside Caitlin's Columbia dorm, watching young
lives in motion.

INT.  DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Claire walks past a number of doors.  Music booms out of one,
shards of a conversation out of another.  Finally, she
arrives at a door that says "Fur is murder."  She smiles to
herself and knocks.  There's no answer.

                     DIFFERENT VOICE (O.S.)
          She's out.

Claire turns to find an attractive YOUNG MAN standing at her
elbow.

                     YOUNG MAN
          They're playing at CBGB's down on Bowery.
          Probably won't be back for awhile.  You
          her mom?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  Who was playing?

                     YOUNG MAN
          Bitch.  Caitlin's band.

                     CLAIRE
               (stunned)
          Caitlin's band?

                     YOUNG MAN
          Yeah.  They're really good.  I would have
          gone, but I have a paper.
               (beat)
          And I'm not just saying that because
          you're a mother.

Claire nods slightly.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you.

She walks down the hall.

INT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT

Claire moves past a huge, BLACK SKINHEAD DOORMAN into an
entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club.  She looks out
over the MOB OF SEETHING YOUNG PEOPLE, swaying to a pulsing
power-pop band.  PUNKS and CLUB KIDS push past her as they
move into the throng.  She looks up and her face changes.

CLAIRE'S POV

A shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a
jangly, but surprisingly melodic song.  Her eyes race across
the faces of a BUTCH FEMALE DRUMMER, an emaciated
GUITARIST/SINGER and stop on the BASS PLAYER...Caitlin.  She
rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, EYES
CLOSED, SWAYING TO THE MUSIC.

Claire is transfixed, her face a mix of pride and sadness.
The song ends and Caitlin's eyes open.  She smiles for a
moment, then the smile fades as she spots Claire.  Panicked,
Claire ducks behind a pillar.

EXT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT

The last groups of YOUNG PEOPLE file out of the club.  A
couple of them glance at Claire, who seems very out of place
standing on the Bowery late at night.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Mom?

She turns to see Caitlin standing before her, a bass guitar
case on a strap over her shoulder.  There's an awkward pause.

                     CLAIRE
          That was very good.

                     CAITLIN
          Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you.
          But it never felt right.

                     CLAIRE
          Why?

Caitlin stares at the ground.

                     CAITLIN
          I didn't want to bring up memories.  I
          didn't want to do anything that might
          make you regret your choices.

Claire winces silently.

                     CAITLIN
          Besides, Dad would have freaked.

                     CLAIRE
          No, he wouldn't.

                     CAITLIN
          I think playing in a band called "Bitch"
          might put a dent in the whole "perfect
          family" thing.

                     CLAIRE
          That's not true.

                     CAITLIN
          Yes it is.  Can we please not do that?
          Please?  Cause it is.

Claire doesn't disagree.

                     CLAIRE
          He loves you very much.  He just--

                     CAITLIN
          I know he does.

Beat.  Claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter.

                     CAITLIN
          Are you mad at me?

                     CLAIRE
          Listen to me.  The one thing in life that
          I definitely don't regret...is the choice.
          I made to be your mother.

They hug.  For a moment, Claire's got her little girl back.
Her eyes well up.

                     CLAIRE
          I miss you.

                     CAITLIN
          So much.

                     CLAIRE
               (laughing)
          It got so bad your father almost had to
          put me away.

                     CAITLIN
          What do you mean?

                     CLAIRE
          I started seeing things.

                     CAITLIN
          A ghost?

Beat.  Claire stares at her daughter.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you?

                     CAITLIN
          No.  But once I heard...

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     CAITLIN
          Someone crying.  A girl.
               (beat)
          I thought I was crazy.

                     CLAIRE
               (quietly)
          Then we both are.

Caitlin nods.

INT.  PRESIDENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

...a large cocktail party.  The house is crowded with
PROFESSORS, ADMINISTRATORS, and their SPOUSES.  PRESIDENT
TEMPLETON, a frosty-haired, avuncular chap, greets them with
his WIFE, a sharp looking woman in her late fifties.

                     TEMPLETON
          There they are.

                     NORMAN
          You remember my wife, Claire.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
               (shaking hands)
          Of course.  You must be so proud.

                     CLAIRE
          I am.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
               (to Norman)
          Everyone's very anxious to shake hands
          with our newest academic celebrity.

She takes their coats.  Dean Templeton leads them in.

                     TEMPLETON
          Must've been some paper.  Your father
          would be very proud.

This seems to strike a nerve.

                     NORMAN
          Uh-huh.

Claire notices this and squeezes his hand.  Templeton leads
Norman into a large living room which is filled with
colleagues.  Several of them turn and begin clapping.  Others
follow suit.

EXT.  PATIO - NIGHT

Claire stands at a small bar.

                     CLAIRE
               (to bartender)
          White wine please.

She scans the party and spots the Feurs deep in some intimate
conversation with each other.  She's speaking about something
astonishing.  He's rapt.

Claire locates Norman in a corner listening as some AGED
ALUMNUS holds forth.  He sees her and mouths, "I'm sorry."
He points to his watch and flashes five fingers.  She smiles
and nods.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Guess I'm not much of a medium.

She turns to see Jody.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody...

They hug.

                     JODY
          Are you okay?

                     CLAIRE
          I think so

                     JODY
          I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus,
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
          It's alright.

                     JODY
          I mess around with this stuff, but I
          never thought anything would happen.

Claire looks uncomfortable.

                     JODY
          Does Norman know?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, she's alive.

                     JODY
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her.
          She's really sweet.

                     JODY
          Then what was it?

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been
          on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident.
          And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--

                     JODY
          Something was there.  You saw it.

                     CLAIRE
          Did I?

                     JODY
          Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a
          guy, this Pakistani guy down in
          Hartford...

                     CLAIRE
          Hartford?

                     JODY
          And he's the real thing.  Specializes in
          cases like this, like yours.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to
          listen to me.  This is not something that
          I can do right now.  Whatever it was,
          it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.

                     JODY
          But Claire--

                     CLAIRE
          Please.

Jody recognizes her fragility.

                     JODY
          Okay.  Okay.

                     CLAIRE
          I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call
          you.

Jody nods as Claire walks off.

INT.  POWDER ROOM - NIGHT

Claire stands in the spacious powder room, checking her
makeup in the mirror.  Mrs. Templeton enters from the
bathroom.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          How're you holding up?

                     CLAIRE
          Just fine.  It's a lovely party.

The two women fix their makeup side-by-side in the mirror.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Norman was telling me the dream house is
          finally finished.

                     CLAIRE
               (nodding)
          Almost.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing
          so well.

Claire looks confused.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm sorry?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          I know how hard it can be sometimes.

Claire turns to her.

                     CLAIRE
          Uh-huh.  What can be?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Well, I don't think I've seen you since
          the reception at Dean Ackerman's last
          year.

Claire's still in the dark.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          For the Dupont Chair.
               (off Claire's look)
          I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I
          used to run from at Amherst.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          There was just...some tension.  You were
          upset.  I remember being concerned.

                     CLAIRE
          At the party.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Toward the end.  You remember?

                     CLAIRE
               (recovering)
          Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you
          know...We're fine.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness,
          but we do have to stick together you
          know.

                     CLAIRE
          Who's that?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          The wives.

Beat.

                     CLAIRE
          Right.

Mrs. Templeton leaves.  Claire looks into the mirror.

                     CLAIRE (V.O.)
          What was it about?

EXT.  TEMPLETON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Claire and Norman walk toward the car.

                     NORMAN
          You don't remember?

                     CLAIRE
          When she said it, there was something
          familiar...but no.

He looks at her for a moment.

                     NORMAN
          You dropped a glass.

                     CLAIRE
          I...

                     NORMAN
          A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You
          started crying.  I tried to comfort you...

                     CLAIRE
               (something's triggered)
          In the living room...

                     NORMAN
          You shoved me away and ran out to the
          patio.  I took you home.

                     CLAIRE
          But why?  I can't understand how I could
          just completely--

                     NORMAN
          It was maybe a week after the accident.
          We were moving.  It was a hard time.

                     CLAIRE
          But I don't remember.

                     NORMAN
          Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.

                     CLAIRE
          What's wrong with me?

He stops, takes her shoulders gently.

                     NORMAN
               (reassuring)
          Nothing.  Nothing at all.  It's been a
          hard year.  But you're better now.  And
          things are really looking up for us.  So
          let's try to enjoy that.
               (gently)
          Please?

She thinks for a beat.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  Yes.  That's what I want.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire walks up to the door.  When she touches the knob she
hears...the WHISPERING.  She opens the door and moves into:

INT.  FOYER - DAY

The same intense whispered exchange.  She glances into the
mirror and sees...SHAPES MOVING, BODIES, A FLASH OF SILVER.
She turns the corner and again...NO ONE'S THERE.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

She walks in and stands before:

The repaired photograph of herself and Norman...at the party
for the DUPONT CHAIR.

She takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then
SMASHES IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK.  She extricates the
picture from the broken glass.  The caption reads:

"Dr. Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont
Chair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman."

She stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over
and scans the stories on the back.  One tells of a hotly
contested city council race, another contains details of a
large alumni donation to the university.

She notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't
noticed before.  It's only a small portion of one column, but
it seems to detail the search for A MISSING GIRL.

INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY

Claire, online, logs onto a missing persons website.  She
narrows her search to NEW ENGLAND.  A screen pops up with a
list of names.  She scrolls down the list until she
finds...FRANK, MADISON ELIZABETH.

                     CLAIRE
          M-E-F...

Claire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a
blurry cyber photo fills the screen.  Slowly, higher
resolution moves down the image.

IT'S THE GHOST.

Under the photo is the legend:

             "DISAPPEARED - OCTOBER 22, 1998"

Claire stares at the familiar face, then shakily hits PRINT.

LATER

Claire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out.

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          ...she was practically a townie.  Grew up
          in Bradford.

                     CLAIRE
          And she was never found?

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          Nah.  She was a live wire.  Had this old
          Mustang Fastback.  It's gone too.  Most of
          her friends think she's tooling around
          Mexico somewhere.  Police downgraded her
          to a runaway.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you, Mr...

She glances at the byline on the back of the newspaper photo.

INSERT

"by Neil McCann"

                     CLAIRE
          ...McCann.

She hangs up.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

Norman is unpacking NOTES and CHEMICALS from his LEATHER BAG.
Claire walks in.

                     CLAIRE
          Remember this?

She places the printout on his desk.  He takes a long look at
it.

                     NORMAN
          Is this that girl from last year?

Claire nods.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you know her?

Norman looks again.

                     NORMAN
          I may have seen her on campus.

                     CLAIRE
          Not personally.

                     NORMAN
          No.
               (beat)
          I'm afraid to ask what this is about.

                     CLAIRE
               (solemnly)
          It's her.  This is the woman who I've
          seen.

                     NORMAN
          The...

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  The ghost.

Norman leaves the hung frame and walks over to a window.

                     CLAIRE
          I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's
          not...

                     NORMAN
               (quietly overlapping)
          Stop...

                     CLAIRE
          ...I'm positive this time...

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          ...Please stop...

                     CLAIRE
          It's Madison Fra--

                     NORMAN
          STOP IT!

Claire falls silent, Norman turns from the window.

                     NORMAN
               (calmly)
          Claire, I've tried to be there.  I know
          you're going through something that I
          can't understand...but it's enough.

Claire looks down.

                     NORMAN
          Do you want to go see someone?  Together?
          Should we call Dr. Drayton?

She shakes her head.

                     NORMAN
          Well then what?  Claire, what?  Tell me
          what I can do.

Long pause.  Claire looks up, then timidly holds out the
printout.

                     CLAIRE
          It's her.

Norman's jaw tightens.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't want to make you angry.  But she's
          here.  And I don't know why...

He silently walks out of the room.  Claire stares down at the
face in the photo.

EXT.  MADISON FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire parks in front of a small, clapboard house in a
neighborhood that is decidedly less upscale than her own.
She gets out and tentatively walks up to the tiny porch.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire rings the bell.  A DRAWN LOOKING WOMAN in her early
fifties answers the door.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Frank?

                     MRS. FRANK
          Yeah.

                     CLAIRE
          I'd like to talk to you about Madison.

                     MRS. FRANK
          You know where she is?

                     CLAIRE
          No, I don't.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Please leave me alone.

She starts to close the door.  Claire leans forward.

                     CLAIRE
          She's my friend.

The woman stops.

                     CLAIRE
          Was.  We were...acquainted.  I've been
          away for awhile.  When I came back...

She studies Claire.

                     MRS. FRANK
          What's your name?

                     CLAIRE
          Claire.

                     MRS. FRANK
          She never mentioned you.

Claire doesn't know what to say to this.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Then again, she didn't say much about her
          college friends.

She gives Claire the once over.

                     MRS. FRANK
          I'm watchin' my shows.

She motions Claire in.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

Claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room.  Mrs.
Frank serves up a mug of coffee.  A soap plays silently on an
old 19" RCA.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha
          nonsense.

                     CLAIRE
          It's fine.

She sizes Claire up.

                     MRS. FRANK
          You look a little old for a student.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not.  We...we met at a party.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Sounds about right.  Never understood how
          a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't
          get it from me.  They wanted to put her in
          a special school for the gifted when she
          was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.

                     CLAIRE
          She never mentioned her father.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was
          twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.

There's a silence.  Mrs. Frank stares at the TV.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Don't need the sound.  You can pretty much
          tell what's happening by the faces.  Turn
          it up sometimes, though.  Feels like
          someone's here.

Claire doesn't know what to say.  Mrs. Frank turns to her.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Why are you here?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

                     MRS. FRANK
          It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No
          note.  Nothing.
               (beat)
          Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna
          know what happened.

Claire stares at this tough, tragic woman.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Wanna see her room?

Claire nods.

INT.  MADISON'S ROOM - DAY

Claire enters the room.  Her face freezes.

ANGLE

SEVERAL POSTERS FOR ALTERNATIVE AND METAL BANDS, side by side
with ACADEMIC PLAQUES AND AWARDS.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She
          wanted to stay close.

                     CLAIRE
          You must have been very proud.

She nods.  Claire moves along looking at pictures.  Some with
different men, others with rough looking friends.  Claire
stops at a picture tucked into a mirror.

INSERT

Madison singing at a recital of some kind.  She's lovely,
with striking GREEN EYES.  Around her neck is a distinctive
SILVER NECKLACE, with a perfectly wrought, SILVER ROSEBUD.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Such a pretty voice.  Surprised she didn't
          major in music.
               (beat)
          That's the last picture.

A phone rings in the hallway.

                     MRS. FRANK
          S'cuse me.

Claire's eye is pulled past the picture into the mirror, the
reflection of something pinned to the edge of a bulletin
board.  She turns and moves over to:

A SHORT BLOND BRAID.  She reaches out to touch it.  Claire
hears footsteps.  Mrs. Frank leans back into the room.

                     MRS. FRANK
          They're calling me in to work.

                     CLAIRE
          I should be going anyway.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Mrs. Frank walks Claire out.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Y'hear anything you'll let me know?

                     CLAIRE
          Of course.

Claire walks to her car.  She turns and calls out:

                     CLAIRE
          What was her major?

                     MRS. FRANK
          Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.

Claire stands, frozen, as Mrs. Frank disappears into the
little house.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Claire shuts the blinds, then places the large candle on the
floor, then places the MISSING GIRL PRINTOUT at the base of
the candle.  On top if it, she places THE BRAID.

Then Claire lights the candle, puts the braid on the picture,
and hunches over it, whispering intensely:

                     CLAIRE
          I need to know the truth.

She waits a beat.  Nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Madison, please...help me.

Nothing happens.  She looks around at the seance props.

She stands and places her hands on the sink.  She glances at
herself in the mirror.

                     CLAIRE
          What am I doing?

Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.  When
she looks back into the mirror, her eyes are a DEEP GREEN.
She hears the front door open downstairs.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Hello...Anybody home?!

A strange smile creeps across her face.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

POV - Gliding down the stairs and into...

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

The refrigerator door is open.  Norman is leaning over.  Only
his ass protrudes.

REVERSE

Norman closes the refrigerator door and sees Claire standing
before him, stripped down to a skirt and slip top.  There's a
different physicality to her movements...a different rhythm
to her speech.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello, Dr. Spencer.

Norman smiles.

                     NORMAN
          Mrs. Spencer.

She shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          Forbidden fruit...

She takes the apple...

                     CLAIRE
          Got a problem with that...

...then takes a ravenous bite and walks out of the room.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

Norman finds Claire seated on his desk, her legs spread.

                     NORMAN
          I take it your not mad at me.

                     CLAIRE
          Wouldn't go that far.

She grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the
apple to his mouth.  Norman tentatively takes a bite.  She
mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly.

                     NORMAN
               (mouth full)
          Okay...

When he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs
down his chin.  Claire leans forward and licks it off.

                     NORMAN
          What's gotten into you?

She just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him.  It
looks like she's eating his lips.  Norman's getting hot.  She
bites down on a lip.

                     NORMAN
          Ow!

                     CLAIRE
          What's the matter?

                     NORMAN
          It's too rough.

                     CLAIRE
          Since when?

Something about this response frightens him.  Claire yanks
Norman's belt open.  He steps back, tripping over his
castered desk chair.  She's on top of him in a flash, sitting
astride him.  She speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper.

                     NORMAN
          I don't like this, this...

                     CLAIRE
               (pinning his hands above his
                head)
          Why don't you shut up and fuck me,
          Professor.

She grinds up against him.  Suddenly, something pulls her eye
to the hallway.

POV - The COAT RACK MIRROR, now from inside the study.  In
it's reflection:  ANOTHER CLAIRE, shorter hair, stunned
expression.  Where she's standing...it's DAYTIME.

Claire leans over him until they're nose-to-nose.

                     CLAIRE
               (tense whisper)
          I think she's starting to suspect
          something.

                     NORMAN
               (through clenched teeth)
          Who?

                     CLAIRE
               (leaning down)
          Your wife...

                     NORMAN
          STOP IT!

Norman shoves her off of him onto the floor.  He stands,
breathless.

                     NORMAN
          What the hell are you doing?!

In a moment, it's Claire again, stunned and trembling against
the wall.

                     CLAIRE
               (to herself, remembering)
          "You know..."

                     NORMAN
               (rattled)
          What?

She looks up.

                     CLAIRE
          I was there.

                     NORMAN
          Claire--

                     CLAIRE
               (flooding back to her)
          I came to work in the garden and I saw
          you with her...in my house.

                     NORMAN
          Oh God...

                     CLAIRE
          I snuck back to my car, trying to
          convince myself it never happened.  And
          when I woke up in the hospital...somehow
          it hadn't.  Until now.

He just stares at her, his face anguished.

                     NORMAN
          It was last year.  We were having
          troubles.

                     CLAIRE
          So you fucked a student?!

                     NORMAN
               (reaching for her)
          That's not what I'm sayi--

                     CLAIRE
               (pulling back)
          DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me.
          Go!

He's frozen.

                     CLAIRE
          I SAID GET OUT!

Norman doesn't move.  He's never seen her like this.

                     CLAIRE
          Fine...

She bolts toward the living room.  He follows her.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She grabs her coat.

                     NORMAN
               (welling up)
          Claire, please don't...

                     CLAIRE
          What did you think I would do?  Jesus
          Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...

                     NORMAN
          I never asked you to quit!

                     CLAIRE
          ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect
          Daddy and that meant perfect wife,
          perfect family...

He follows her as she searches for her purse and keys.

                     NORMAN
          THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And
          then when you did, you hated me for it...
          so you gave it all to her.

                     CLAIRE
          Who?

                     NORMAN
          To Caitlin!!

She wheels on him with fury.

                     CLAIRE
          Leave her out of this!

                     NORMAN
          And then out of nowhere, some bright
          young woman found me attractive...

                     CLAIRE
          Stop...

                     NORMAN
          ...would do anything just to be around
          me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I
          slipped.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not going to listen to this.

Claire goes to leave, Norman blocks her path.

                     NORMAN
          I tried to break it off!

                     CLAIRE
          You should have tried harder.

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
               (seething)
          Get out of my way.

She brushes past him.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

He catches up, beside himself.

                     NORMAN
          PLEASE DON'T GO!

Claire's nearly disarmed by this rare emotional outburst.
She turns at the door and looks back.

                     CLAIRE
          You made it impossible for me to be
          someone you could be in love with.

She leaves.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Norman, rumpled and unshaven, is passed out on the couch, a
half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table.  He
awakens to find Claire sitting across from him.

                     CLAIRE
          I want you to answer one question.

He waits.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you have anything to do with her
          disappearance?

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Yes.

Claire goes pale.

                     NORMAN
          She was damaged and unstable.  The more I
          tried to distance myself, the more
          desperate she became.  Finally, she showed
          up at the new house...

                     CLAIRE
          How did she know where it was?

He stares off.  The reality sinks in for Claire.

                     CLAIRE
               (softly)
          Our dream house.

Norman can hardly look at her.

                     NORMAN
          She was out of control.  She said she was
          going to kill herself...or you.  I never
          thought she'd go through with any of it,
          but then she was gone...

He trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          She did it.

                     NORMAN
          We don't know that for sure.

                     CLAIRE
          Of course she did, Norman.  What else
          could it be?

The enormity of this hits Norman.  His head drops into his
hands.

                     NORMAN
          Oh God, what have I done?  How could I
          have let this into our lives?

He looks up at her, teary.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

She gets up and walks out of the room.

EXT.  JODY'S STUDIO - DAY

An old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished
oil paintings.  Jody brings Claire some tea.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and everything I have, everything I
          thought my life was...Christ when I think
          of all the lies...

Jody looks down.

                     CLAIRE
          What?
               (beat)
          Jody what?

Jody looks up, tears in her eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...you knew.

                     JODY
          I was down in Adamant...

                     CLAIRE
          Adamant?

                     JODY
          Artsy little village down seven.  There's
          a guy there who sells my work.  I had just
          dropped off some paintings and as I got
          in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this
          little cafe.

Claire waits for her to continue.

                     JODY
          I started to walk over...but he wasn't
          alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse.
          She was young.
               (beat)
          I should have said something right away.
          But I didn't.

                     CLAIRE
          Why?

                     JODY
          Partly because I didn't want to hurt
          you...but partly...partly because I was
          relieved.

                     CLAIRE
          Relieved?

                     JODY
          I had just been left by Richard.  I was
          bitter and miserable and for some fucked
          up reason, it made me feel better that
          your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.

Claire nods.

                     JODY
          By the time I finally got up the nerve to
          tell you, Stan called from the hospital
          and it was too late.

                     CLAIRE
          Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.

                     JODY
          Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of
          Valium in your system?

Claire walks over to a window.

                     JODY
          I got there first.  Stan covered up the
          pills and I had it out with Norman.  He
          seemed desperate not to lose you.  He
          promised to handle it.  And we all let it
          drop away.

                     CLAIRE
          All of us.

Beat.

                     JODY
          I'm a terrible friend.

                     CLAIRE
          No.

Claire turns.

                     CLAIRE
          How could I expect you to tell me
          something that I wouldn't even tell
          myself?

                     JODY
          What are you going to do?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

                     JODY
          If she was dangerous before--

                     CLAIRE
          She could have hurt me if she wanted to.

                     JODY
          You don't know that.
               (beat)
          If it's your belief that gives her form,
          then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow
          you have to break the connection.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now
          that I do...I think she's at peace.

Jody isn't as sure.

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

Claire walks in.  She notices the clock on the range is dark.
She flips on a light.  Nothing happens.  Worried, she heads
upstairs.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - MORNING

Claire enters.  The bed is empty.  The shower is running in
the bathroom.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman?

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

ANGLE - CLAIRE...her face a mask of terror.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...

CLAIRE'S POV

The BATHTUB, with the shower curtain drawn around it, the
water blasting.  Norman's limp hand pokes through the
curtain.  AN ELECTRIC CORD leads from the mirror socket into
the tub.

Claire races over and rips the plug from the wall.  She tears
the SHOWER CURTAIN AWAY to find A BLUISH NORMAN lying,
unconscious in the tub.

                     CLAIRE
          No, no.  Please no...

She hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a
heartbeat.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman!!  Wake up!  Please!

Claire shakes him to no effect.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...NORMAN!

She slaps him on the face...once, then twice.  He suddenly
sucks in a gulp of air, begins struggling and dazedly returns
to life.

                     CLAIRE
          It's me...it's me...

Sobbing, she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to
pull him upright.  She discovered HER BLOWDRYER in the tub
and hurls it across the room.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Claire sits beside Norman on the bed as two E.M.T.'s, an OLD
GUY and a HEAVY WOMAN pack up.  Stan's on the phone, Jody off
to one side.

                     HEAVY WOMAN
          Vitals are good.  I'd take it easy for a
          couple of days.

                     NORMAN
          Thanks.

The E.M.T.'s leave as Stan hangs up.

                     STAN
          They'll take you for a CAT scan tomorrow
          if you're feeling dizzy at all.

                     NORMAN
          That won't be necessary.   

He glances at Claire as he walks Stan out.

                     NORMAN
          Not unless there's a miracle drug for
          clumsiness.

They leave.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, she tried to kill him.

                     JODY
          I know.

                     CLAIRE
          I can't believe this is happening.

                     JODY
          We need help.  Please let me call the
          medium.

                     CLAIRE
          That could take days.  I need to do
          something now.  Don't you see?  She wants
          us dead.

Jody thinks for a moment.

                     JODY
          Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened
          this door.  There's got to be a way that
          you can close it.

                     CLAIRE
          Like what?

                     JODY
          I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just
          making this up...

                     CLAIRE
          What is it?

                                                      CUT TO:

MADISON'S SMILING FACE

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Claire's staring down at the PRINTOUT.  She's kneeling at the
edge of the dock.  From her pocket she produces THE BLOND
BRAID and a piece of TWINE.  She wraps the braid up in the
printout with a rock and secures it with the twine.

                     CLAIRE
          Sorry.  Better or worse, he's mine.

She tosses the little parcel into the dark water.  Bubbles
stream up.  In the bubbles, Claire sees...THE PALE SHAPE,
which slowly becomes THE DROWNED GIRL, staring up from
beneath the dark water.

Claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed.  Madison
reaches up toward the surface.  As the bubble diminish, she
seems to be FADING AWAY.  When she's gone, Claire reaches out
toward the water.  When her finger touches the surface...

WHOOSH!  She's sucked down into the water.

INT.  UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM - DAY

Norman glances out of the window in time to see a splash off
the dock.  He races out of the room.

EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY

Claire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her
deeper into the murky depths.

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Norman sprints toward the dock.

EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY

As he oxygen begins to run out, Claire screams desperately as
her hand plunges into the muddy bottom.

Suddenly, she's released.  She yanks her hand free, the silt
swirls revealing...a COPPER COLORED GLINT in the mud.

NORMAN'S HAND grasps Claire's ankle and pulls her upwards.

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Norman helps Claire, coughing, onto the dock.  They hold each
other.

                     NORMAN
          Are you okay?

She nods, catching her breath.

                     NORMAN
          We have to get out of here.

                     CLAIRE
          It's alright.

                     NORMAN
          Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.

                     CLAIRE
          She's gone.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          She can't be here without me.

                     NORMAN
          How can you be sure?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know, but I am.  She was there and
          then she was gone.  I felt it.

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

She stares into the still water.

                     CLAIRE
          It's over.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire in bed with a blanket wrapped around her.  Norman
walks in with some steaming mulled cider.  He stokes the
blazing fire.  He sits on the edge of the bed.

                     NORMAN
          I know it's going to take awhile before
          things are back...until they're better
          than before.  But you've given us a chance
          to make a fresh start.  And I'm going to
          spend the rest of my life making you glad
          that you did.

The gaze at each other.  Tentatively, she places a hand on
his.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Claire, dressed in a warm sweater, finishes wrapping her
rosebushes for the winter.  She picks up a basket of clipped
flowers and heads inside.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

She turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering.  All
is quiet.

INT.  FOYER - DAY

She looks into the mirror and sees only the study and the
lake behind it.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in
doing so, accidentally knocks it over.

With a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the
wooden floor.  The stream has flowed over to the knot and
dripped into the crack.  Claire stares down at THE STRANGE
COPPER COIN.

She grabs a letter opener from Norman's desk and pries the
coin out.  It's actually a SMALL BRASS KEY, the head of which
is THREE INTERLOCKING CIRCLES.  She stares at it for a
moment, then places it in her pocket.

EXT.  SAILBOAT - DUSK

Claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset.  The leaves
on the surrounding hills are stunning.  Norman appears beside
her.

                     NORMAN
          Last sail of the year.

She gazes out.

                     CLAIRE
          The leaves...

                     NORMAN
          Incredible.  We should take a drive before
          they're gone.  Spend the night at some
          cozy little bed and breakfast.

                     CLAIRE
          Look for antiques...

                     NORMAN
          Yep.  There's some great places nearby.

                     CLAIRE
               (a reflex)
          Adamant.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Little village down seven.  Supposed to be
          charming.

                     NORMAN
          Huh.

                     CLAIRE
          Do you know it?

                     NORMAN
          Don't think so.

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe we can stop there for lunch.

He wraps an arm around her.

                     NORMAN
          Whatever you'd like.

She leans against him, staring out.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

Jody and Claire return from a walk.  Norman has the boat on
the trailer and is securing a tarp over it.  They stop under
a tree.

                     CLAIRE
          But he acted like he'd never heard of it.

                     JODY
          Did he say that?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody he was lying.

                     JODY
          What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to
          bring that up again just when you're
          trying to make a new start?

                     CLAIRE
          I guess not.

                     JODY
          He's trying to put it behind him, Claire.
          You should too.

Norman smiles and waves.  They wave back as they arrive at
the Karman-Ghia.

                     JODY
          You've got a beautiful life.  And even
          with this, it's always been clear that he
          loves you.
               (beat)
          I've come to think that's all that really
          matters.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know...

                     JODY
          Trust me, Claire.  You hear something...
          change the subject.  You find something...
          get rid of it, throw it in the lake.
               (beat)
          You know what happened.  The rest is only
          details.  And no one's ever glad they got
          a hold of those.  If you want to put this
          back together...just let it go.

Jody drives off.  Claire walks over to Norman.  She hugs him
tightly.

                     NORMAN
          What's that for?

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.

                     NORMAN
          I'm cooking you dinner.

                     CLAIRE
          You don't have to do that.

                     NORMAN
          I know.

                     CLAIRE
          Fine.  I'll do the shopping.

They kiss.  She heads to the Volvo.

INT.  VOLVO - DAY

Claire is approaching a country market.  She spots a little
sign with an arrow:

                     ADAMANT - 11 mi.

She hesitates for a moment, then take the turn.

EXT.  ADAMANT - DAY

Claire stands on a street in the quaint little village.  She
looks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables.  A
friendly old HIPPIE WOMAN walks out of a store.  She watches
Claire gazing around.

                     HIPPIE WOMAN
          What are you looking for?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't really know.

                     HIPPIE WOMAN
          Know what you mean.

She ambles off across the street.  Claire watches her go.
Then notices a sign hung out above a little shop.  THREE
INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  She walks toward it.

EXT.  SHOP - DAY

Claire stands in front of the store window.  A sign in the
window identifies it as "The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought
jewelry and gifts."  Claire tries to open the door, but sees
a closed sign.

She steps back out to the window and looks in.  On display
are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios.

Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an
intricate ROSEBUD.

Her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display
where she spots, a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST.  Protruding
from its lock...THE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  Claire looks like
she's been punched.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Claire glances over at the soundly sleeping Norman.  She
gingerly slides out of bed.

INT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT

Claire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album,
tracking the years of their life.  Her hands tremble.
Finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches
behind the photo and produces...THE KEY.

EXT.  DOCK - NIGHT

Claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the
dock.  An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path.
She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake.

She holds out a fist.  Her fingers unfold and in her palm
lies THE KEY.  She holds the key out over the water and
stands there, frozen.  The lighthouse beam sweeps past her
once...then again.

Claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest,
then carefully places it on the dock.  She very deliberately
takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the
dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps
off the dock.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

AN ANGUISHED CRY from downstairs.  Norman bolts upright in
bed.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit
room.  He pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting
closed on his desk.  He looks around, sees the room is empty
and walks over to it.

The mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is
engraved:  To N.C.S. with love always, M.E.F.

He pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside.

THE LIGHTS SWITCH ON.

Claire stands in the doorway, holding out the SILVER ROSEBUD
NECKLACE.

                     CLAIRE
          Looking for this?

Norman stares at her dumbly.

                     CLAIRE
          She's out there isn't she?  She's in the
          lake.

                     NORMAN
          Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what
          this is.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING
          NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!

                     NORMAN
               (nearly hysterical)
          I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus.
          Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she
          was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On
          my life!  She took pills and she killed
          herself in our house to destroy me!  To
          destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here
          before school, the painters would have--

                     CLAIRE
          I don't believe you.

                     NORMAN
          IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe
          me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!
               (beat, fighting tears)
          I did what I had to, Claire.  She was
          gone.  There was nothing I could do for
          her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I
          rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.
               (beat)
          And I've lived with that image ever since.
               (beat)
          I couldn't just stand there while
          everything-- my career, us,
          everything, just washed away.  Don't you
          see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is
          exactly what she wants you to think!

Claire's lip is quivering with confusion.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know what's true anymore.
               (beat)
          But that girl must be brought up.  Now do
          you want to call the police?  Or should I?

Norman stares at the phone.  He's a wreck.

                     NORMAN
          Fine.  I can't live with it anymore.

He takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits.

                     NORMAN
          This is Dr. Norman Spencer.  No, it's not
          an emergency.

He looks at Claire.

                     NORMAN
          I have some information about a missing
          girl, Madison Frank...Yes.  Could you send
          an officer?  Fifteen Willoughby, about a
          mile before the bridge...Thank you.

He hangs up.  Long silence.  They look at each other.

                     NORMAN
          You did the right thing.
               (beat)
          I'm going to get cleaned up.

He walks out.  Claire walks over and stands before the box.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks into the bedroom.  The shower can be heard
through the bathroom door, which is partially ajar.  Steam
drifts out through the crack.

She stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her
weary, distraught countenance in the mirror.  She glances
down.

CLAIRE'S POV

The necklace still in her hand.

She looks up again into the mirror.  Her face goes strangely
blank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto
her neck.

Suddenly, she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on the
bed for a long moment.  She walks over, picks up the phone
and looks at it.

CLAIRE'S POV

The redial button.

She stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button.  Two
rings, then:

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          Directory assistance...

Claire's eyes widen in terror.  She clicks off the phone,
and, taking it with her, starts moving toward the door to the
hall.  She keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom.  She
quietly pulls open the hallway door.

Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.

Claire shoves Norman's hand away and runs past him down the
hall.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

She's nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to
falter.  She tumbles over, dropping the phone, which clatters
down the stairs before her.

Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
Norman can be seen calmly following her, waiting for the
Halothane to take its full effect.  Finally, she freezes.
Norman picks up the phone and stands over her.

                     NORMAN
          God, how did we come to this?

He picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her
slowly up the stairs.

                     NORMAN
          The ghost stuff, that was impressive.

CLAIRE'S POV

Ceiling, shapes...

                     NORMAN
          I figure you saw her that day in the
          house and just gradually intuited the
          whole damn thing.  That would be pretty
          astonishing.  A passive-aggressive
          masterpiece.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

And into the bathroom.

                     NORMAN
          Wasn't until the shower that I realized
          you actually believed it.  Nearly froze to
          death waiting for you.  Thought the
          circuit breaker would kick back over and
          I'd be toast.

...then she's lowered into the tub.

                     NORMAN
          The crazy thing is...I have never for one
          moment stopped loving you.

He actually wipes a tear from his eye.  He kisses her lips.
We can feel her revulsion.  His face over her.

                     NORMAN
          Don't worry about Caitlin.  I'm sure in
          some tragic way this'll bring us closer
          together.

He turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line of
vision.  Sound of a number being dialed.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Hey, it's Norman.  Listen, we had a huge
          blowout, so I'm going down to sleep at
          the lab.  I guess you're out, but...
          maybe...if you wouldn't mind stopping by
          to check on her in the morning?

She glances down and sees on the edge of the tub...a
prescription bottle of VALIUM with her name on the label.
Her eyes go wide.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          It's just...Jody, it's bad.  I've never
          seen her like this...
               (he trails off, choking up)
          I don't really know what to do anymore.

Norman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light house
beacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her.

                     NORMAN
          If anything ever happened to her, I'd...
               (beat)
          Anyway, thanks.

Claire, mute, glances frantically around.  One of her fingers
begins to flutter.

                     NORMAN
               (tearfully)
          I'm so sorry.

The tub is rapidly filling.  He checks his watch, then
reaches for the Valium.  As much from will as the drug
beginning to fade, Claire lets out a garbled cry.

                     CLAIRE
               (sloppy, guttural)
          Mmmuh...

                     NORMAN
          Shhhh.

                     CLAIRE
               (slurry)
          Mauduh...

Norman stops.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          MADISON!

Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief
in the ghost.

                     NORMAN
          That's a little much, don't you think?

He sees the necklace on her neck.

                     NORMAN
          Oops.  Can't have that.

He puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around
Claire's neck to remove the necklace.  When his hands close
on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.

NORMAN'S POV

His arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE.

Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS
SHOWER NOZZLE.  He staggers out of the bathroom before
collapsing with a thud.  The water finally rises above
Claire's nostrils.

Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and
yank it free.  The water slowly descends.

When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally
clears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps of
air.

The drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman's
unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  She
turns off the water and stands unsteadily.

She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little
antenna protruding from under Norman.  She delicately pulls
the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's
been broken by his fall.  She drops it and walks quietly out
of the room.

INT.  STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

She fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door, then looks
at the cell phone's recharging cradle.  It's empty.

She spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles
through the pockets.  She finds the phone, and flips it open
to see if it's working.  A drop of something splats on the
phone.  Then another.  It's blood.

She looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring
down from the landing.

She reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in
her hand make it difficult to open.  Norman hurls himself
over the banister.  THUD!

A BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards.  Claire slams into the
corner by the armoir.  Norman advances on her.  At the last
moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles
over on Norman.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S
PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.

She starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in
the bed...nobody there.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

The truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over.  She stares
at the door for signs of Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on...come on...

...and VROOM, the truck roars to life.  Claire spews gravel
as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway,
constantly watching the door.

When she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks
into the rear view mirror.  The boat momentarily blocks the
open door, then clears.  Still nothing.

EXT.  DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the
ancient heater.  She turns onto THE BRIDGE.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

ANGLE

Claire through the windshield.  Her face striped by the
reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across
the windshield.  She flips open the cell phone and punches in
911.  It blinks:  "NO SERVICE."

                     CLAIRE
          Shit.

She glances into the rear view mirror.

CLAIRE'S POV

A stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping
in the breeze.

Claire desperately punches the "talk" button again..."NO
SERVICE."  She's past the center of the bridge.  She looks
again:  "ROAM."  Claire punches the talk button again.

SMASH!

A TRAILER CRANK punches through the window.  Norman's arm
follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim
visage pressed against the glass.

She squashes down the accelerator.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the
pickup.  Claire chokes, then blacks out.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling
over bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP.

The truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled
through the rear window and into the passenger side
dashboard.

INT.  PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER

Claire is unconscious in the driver's seat, a trickle of
blood runs from her nose.  Norman stirs briefly as Claire
groggily comes to.  She hears the hissing of the smashed
radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the
floor of the cab.

She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and
realizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND
TRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into
the water.

Before she can get the door open, the truck is half
submerged.  She frantically manages to lower her window
halfway and starts to pull herself out.

Her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks
onto her ankle and yanks her inside.  Norman pulls her down
until they're face to face.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman...NO...

She yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late...the
submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp.
The truck is nearly submerged.

                     CLAIRE
               (desperately)
          Norman, please...

The water is up to the windows.  Norman shakes his head
slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          Think of Caitlin...

Water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and
momentarily blinds Norman.  Claire jerks free and scrambles
out of the driver's side window as the truck sinks.

Just as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop.  She
looks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand
clamped onto her ankle.

There is a wrenching metallic creak.  The truck lurches
downward...then silence.  IT DOESN'T SINK.  The boat buoys it
like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake.

The headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater
drop off.  Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not
letting go.

Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights
reveal...

MADISON'S SUBMERGED MUSTANG

SMASH!

When the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car,
the Mustang's windshield shatters.  A PALE SHAPE FLOATS
UPWARD.

Norman is suddenly entangled by something.  He tries to brush
it free but comes face-to-face with MADISON'S GHASTLY,
DECOMPOSED FACE.  The last of his air bellows out of him in a
scream as he releases Claire's ankle.

His dead staring face separates from Madison's as the truck
slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom.

EXT.  LAKE - DAWN

Claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air.

                                                      CUT TO:

UNDERWATER - DAWN

The sound of a furious cello solo.

COLD STARING EYES

Norman, half out of the truck, arms floating.

Follow his eyes to THE PALE CORPSE, drifting above, tethered
to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle.

Move through the murky water toward the corpse's clothed
back.  As she twists into view...

MORPHS INTO:  MADISON'S PALE BEAUTIFUL FACE...at peace.

Camera drifts, moves upward and breaks the surface as the
distant lights of EMERGENCY VEHICLES approach.

                                                      CUT TO:

FINGERS

...filled with moist earth.  A hand tosses the clump of dirt
onto...

EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY

A CASKET

Widen to reveal Claire, dressed in black, stepping away from
the grave.  A tiny arm snakes around her waist.  She glances
down to see Caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother
tightly.  Claire takes a last look into the grave.

                     CLAIRE
          Rest in peace.

THE GRAVESTONE - MADISON ELIZABETH FRANK

Mother and daughter turn and step back.  Next to them, also
in black, is MRS. FRANK.

                                                      CUT TO:

FINGERS

Racing across the neck of a cello.  The solo continues and
now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped Claire
before.

WIDEN TO REVEAL

INT.  A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Claire, her hair short and sexy, eyes tightly shut, brow
beaded with sweat.  The piece builds to a dark, passionate
crescendo.

Her eyes remain shut for a moment, then flutter open.

CLAIRE'S POV

A New York apartment, the glimmering skyline visible through
a large window.  Cooper gazes up attentively.

Claire sips a glass of wine, her face unsmiling, but serene.

                                                    FADE OUT.

                           THE END

1   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                                 1

    Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks
    occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white
    tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch
    over what was my left eye.

                        ME (V.O.)
              I'm old. And all I have left is the
              will to remember...

    I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black &
    white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below
    me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of
    Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires.

    The Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            *

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              ...and the fear I'll forget...

    Slide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30
    years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              I killed innocent men. I betrayed
              sacred oaths. I reaped profit from
              horror. The names are dead or too
              guilty to tell. The events so
              brutal they beg to be re-told...

    Legend: Los Angeles, Fall 1958


2   INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - FIGHT NIGHT                         2

    The battered face of an Irish Pug. Same guy? No. A hard jab
    bashes the Pug out of frame. And there I am: next to the
    `Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar.

                        ME (V.O.)
              Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice
              Division. LAPD. That's what my face
              looked like before.

    My point of view now: Irish Pug on the business end of this
    bantam Black's combos. Standing to my left: SERGEANT RICHARD
    "JUNIOR" STEMMONS. Twenty-six.

                                                             2.



                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Junior Stemmons. A partner I never
              asked for. The scowl meant to hide
              a shit-scared kid who'd been
              teaching evidence classes three
              months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD
              lifer who never got past Sergeant.

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              We should make our move now.

                        ME
              Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you
              wanna be at the center of a riot?

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              I don't wanna be here when Noonan
              and the Feds show up.

    I point at the bantam Black:

                        ME
              We let Sanderline finish this
              beating, we get his gratitude.                          *

    Junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for
    `Untouchables' to break the doors down. I hate the way panic
    smells when I stand this close to it.

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too-

                        ME
              -relax Junior.


3   INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              3

    The Bantam Black: SANDERLINE JOHNSON. Led through the double
    doors. He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping
    jabs inches from REUBEN RUIZ: a muscled middle-weight, fight-
    taped hands cuffed behind his back. I smile big:

                        ME
              Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of
              the LAPD and a real big fan-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              -you're under arrest.

    Sanderline spooks, steps back. Turn and make sure Junior sees
    the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as I speak to
    Sanderline again:

                                                             3.



                        ME
              No you're not. Reuben is-

                        REUBEN RUIZ
              -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-

                        ME
              -for being a ranked fighter who
              still steals hubcaps. Shut up.
                  (off Ruiz, back to
                   Sanderline)
              If I was gonna arrest you, I
              wouldn't have let you finish: and
              that hook-uppercut combo you got is
              something special.
                  (from Reuben, beat)
              Reuben's in custody. But you could
              be our Guest. Whaddya say?


4   EXT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER                        4

    Me, Junior, Reuben, and Sanderline aim for the nearest exit.
    Behind the stands. Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes,
    hats pulled down tight. Feature the Announcer:

                        RING ANNOUNCER
              Ladies and Gentleman...due to
              circumstances beyond our control,
              Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-

    -BOOS drown the PA. Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer.
    Fights erupt in the stands. I can't stifle a chuckle. Three
    exits down: day late-dollar short Feds. WELLES NOONAN, elbows-
    out, surveying the scene like a half-assed Rommel.

                        ME (V.O.)
              Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy
              League Crimefighter. Launching a
              big boxing probe as a way to begin
              prying into everything else crooked
              and corrupt in LA.

    Move faster.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Unaware the LAPD was walking away
              with his two big witnesses.

    As we near the side exit I stop. Junior pauses, less than a
    foot from my face, pointing up at Noonan, pure panic.

                                                             4.



                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              C'MON-JESUS-HE'S RIGHT THERE!

    My P.O.V.: second row, washed-up gangster Mickey Cohen with a
    Blonde far too beautiful for his world, a woman you've seen
    before, but only in a yellowed B&W picture 30 years in the
    future. I can't take my eyes away...five seconds-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
              -HE SEES US!

    Noonan's gaze strafes us. I see him squint.

                        ME
              Then you can stop pointing at him.

    Double-time out the double-doors.


5   INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - NIGHT                                 5

    9th floor suite. All four of us. I order room service.

                        ME
              Hungry Sanderline?

    Sanderline digs the digs: sports the Ambassador robe over his
    street clothes, reading the Bible.

                        SANDERLINE JOHNSON
              If they got shrimp.

                        ME
                  (into the phone)
              Shrimp cocktail.
                  (over to Reuben)
              You want something Reuben?

                        REUBEN RUIZ
              To know why the fuck I'm here-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              -mind your tone, Shitbird...

                        REUBEN RUIZ
              Shitbird went out with Vaudeville.
              You get your badge in a cereal box?

                        ME
              You're here because we want you to
              remember where you live.

                                                            5.



                    SANDERLINE
              (grade-school mind)
          City of Angels.

                    ME
          Excellent Sanderline.

                    REUBEN RUIZ
          What?

                    ME
          You live in LA, Asshole. You do not
          live in `Federal Government.'

Ruiz turns `caught-me' pink...I nod to Junior: split `em.
Playing adjoining hotel rooms like sweat boxes.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          We get to spend time alone now.

                    REUBEN RUIZ
          Want some perfume?

Junior shoves Ruiz through the inner-door connecting the
rooms. Sanderline giggles. Close the door behind them. Sit
down inches from Sanderline, change my tone:

                    ME
          Stop laughing.

Instant quiet.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          What were you gonna tell Welles
          Noonan?
              (watch as he flinches)
          He has a subpoena with your name on
          it, Sanderline. Why would someone
          like you need to talk to the U.S.
          Attorney?

Sanderline staying silent...

                    ME (CONT'D)
          You're a legbreaker for the Mob. I
          know the Men that pay you for that
          will murder you if they hear you're
          about to talk to the U.S.-

                    SANDERLINE JOHNSON
          -but they don't know...

                                                         6.



                    ME
              (beat, small smile)
          And they don't have to. Now tell me
          what you were gonna tell Noonan-

-phone rings. Sanderline flinches for the second time.

                    SANDERLINE
          Bet you they ran outta shrimp.

I stand, step, answer it:

                    ME
          Yeah.

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
          The Spook with you?

Mild shock. Catalogue potential "who's"...

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (CONT'D)
          C'mon, we know he is. We're just
          trying to be mysterious-

                    ME
          -who's `we?'

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
          Me and Sam G.

                    ME (V.O.)
          G for `Giancana.' I owe him favors
          for the rest of my life.

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
          We're out at the place in Palm
          Springs. You should come out for
          the weekend.

                    ME
          Tell Sam if I get minute-

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE
          -yer gonna have to make a minute
          for him. Now. See, we think the
          Spade might testify that Sam owns
          him and how we was grooming him for
          a title shot he was gonna tank. A
          fight everybody woulda' got flush
          off of, including the Spade.                        *
              (beat, quieter)
          Have him look out the window Klein.

                                                               7.



    Click. A breath. Drop the phone on the cradle...step to the
    window...open it...then I chuckle genuine:

                        ME
              Sanderline, you gotta see this...

    Trusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window:

                          SANDERLINE JOHNSON
              What'm I-

    -smash his head against the frame using his forward motion.
    He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to
    pitch his legs up and out. My face a quick-change evil mask.

    Feature Sanderline's nine-story fall. That Ambassador Hotel
    robe billows behind him like a cape. He detonates an overhead
    streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway.

    Unzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside
    now. Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the
    door. Step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where
    Sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up...

                        ME
              DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP?

    Lunge to the window: Sanderline post-mortem. Head shattered.
    Valets sprinting. Junior on the phone. Ruiz steps-up next to
    me: horrified. I keep staring at the smashed body...whisper:

                        ME (CONT'D)
              Remember where you live.

    Reuben has to use both hands to steady himself.


6   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - BRADLEY'S OFFICE - MORNING           6

    Spartan space appointed with high-ticket items like the
    mahogany table around which we sit. Outside: echoes of a
    protest filter through the windows:

                        MUFFLED PROTEST AMALGAM (O.C.)
              MEXICAN BROTHERS SI! IMPERIAL
              DODGERS NO!

    Four of us at the table glued to the T.V, watching U.S.
    Attorney Welles Noonan lambasting the LAPD.

                        ME (V.O.)
              LA's version of the Young Turks,
              only meaner.
                        (MORE)

                                                8.

                    ME (V.O.) (cont'd)
          Boyce Bradley, Chief of Detectives.
          Smartest man in town. And one of
          the richest: Dad was a Real Estate
          Developer who owned a strip of land
          that's now known as the Santa
          Monica Freeway. On either side,
          Bradley's book-ends: D.A. Bob
          Gallaudet, not the smartest man in
          town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my
          notes at USC Law. And Tom Bethune,
          running for a City Council seat
          that'll decide if this Mexican slum
          called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed
          and renamed `Dodger Stadium.'              *

                    BRADLEY
          Turn it off.

Bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power.

                    ME
          I was pissing. He was jumping.

Bradley picks up a newspaper:

                    BRADLEY
          `US Attorney Noonan is accusing the
          Los Angeles Police Department in
          general, and Lt. David Klein in
          particular, of murder at worst,
          gross incompetence at best...'

                    ME
          Noonan had Sanderline scared. After
          he sang to me he panicked & jumped.

                    TOM BETHUNE
          He did spend a month in Camarillo
          Mental Hospital last year-

                    GAS CHAMBER BOB
          -and wearing that hotel robe over
          his clothes makes him look even
          more looney-bin.

                    TOM BETHUNE
          Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So
          Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's
          got nothing-

                    BRADLEY
          -but time, a mandate and new
          targets...I need to speak to the
          Lieutenant alone.

                                                         9.



Bob and Tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles
lending support before Dad drops the hammer. Door closes. I
stand, step to the window, big Pro-Mex protest below: Geeks
and placards: `BASEBALL IS AS AMERICAN AS THE TRAIL OF TEARS!

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)
          Describe to me your duty, as you
          understood it, regarding Sanderline
          Johnson and Reuben Ruiz.

                    ME
          Take both men into custody before
          Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   *
          out what they were going to tell-

                    BRADLEY
          -and why did I choose you for this?

                    ME
          Because I'm a Cop with a law
          degree, and you thought my legal-

                     BRADLEY
          -because your a thug with a law
          degree. Because I thought by now
          you'd be so indebted to this
          Department for not indicting and/or                   *
          imprisoning you, that diligent,
          honest discharge of duty would be
          assured.
              (beat)
          And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    *

                    ME
          Bethune and Gallaudet don't think
          so.

                    BRADLEY
          Bob's happy because he wants to be
          State Attorney General and his most
          likely opponent will be Welles
          Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton
          Diskant, who's leading their City
          Council race, is endorsed by
          Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing
          the larger play.
              (with calculated emphasis)
          Noonan's new target will likely be
          the LAPD itself.

                    ME
          How do you know that?

                                                        10.



                     BRADLEY
          Because that's where I would aim: a
          subpoenaed Federal witness plummets
          to his death in the company of two
          LAPD detectives?
              (beat)
          This screams Police Corruption.                      *
          This offers Noonan the possibility
          of payback in the form of national
          headlines.

I wave it all off:

                    ME
          Johnson did that stint at the Nut
          House -- leak his file to your
          friends at the times-

-and Bradley drops his bomb: Coroner's file. I stare...guess
the contents...try to keep my heart rate in-check...

                    BRADLEY
          My friends would be more interested
          in this.
              (beat, flipping file open)
          Coroner's preliminary: white paint
          chips found embedded in Sanderline
          Johnson's scalp. A matching dent on
          the white window sill. I checked
          with the hotel switchboard and
          found a call was patched to your
          room at about the same time Johnson
          flew out of it.
              (beat, proclamation:)
          It shocks and sickens me that your
          allegiance to the Chicago mob would
          take precedence over the LAPD.

                    ME
              (fuck drawing this out)
          Alright. Where's this going?                         *
              (pull my badge, table it)
          Gun? Shield? What?

                    BRADLEY
          The appearance of disciplinary
          measures taken against you are
          mandated post-Sanderline Johnson,                    *
          so your suspension will be recorded
          but sealed...and kept quiet for now-                 *

                                                           11.



                    ME
          So if the papers or Noonan come
          sniffing around-

                    BRADLEY
          -we can provide adequate proof of
          your dismissal.

                    ME
          But you're not dismissing me.

                    BRADLEY
          Just on paper.
              (closes the file)
          Since I misjudged the Cop I thought
          you were, I'm going to leverage the
          Cop that you are.

Bradley slides the morning paper over. Front page: `Candidate
Diskant Hears The Hue and Cry of The Underclass...' The photo
shows a smiling Diskant, rolled shirt-sleeves, in the middle     *
of a sea of LA Immigrants, all smiling back.                     *

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)
          Morton Diskant is to be removed
          from the City Council race. The
          means and methods implemented to
          that end I will entrust to you.

                    ME
              (throw a thumb at Bethune)
          You want me to torpedo Diskant so
          your buddy Bethune can win a City                      *
          Council seat uncontested-

                    BRADLEY
          -or spend the next month in lock-up                    *
          before being arraigned on charges                      *
          of gross misconduct and dereliction                    *
          of duty. The preamble before you                       *
          face life in prison for murder.                        *

I stare back. Feel myself getting fitted for strings...

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)
          Diskant works Saturdays. Late.

Bradley waves me out. I intentionally drag my badge back
across the desk, scratching his Mahogany heirloom.               *

                                                            12.




7   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                                7

    Hollywood Hills loom in the distance.

                        ME (V.O.)
              Bradley's stooge now. A smart play
              suspending me: a built-in shield                        *
              for him if things go sideways.

    Traffic teeming up Fairfax, tourettes-like glances in my rear-
    view...a Black Buick...maybe mirroring my lane changes.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Black Buick...five Cars
              back...feels like a tail...

    Brake hard. They hang a left on Fountain.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              ...or maybe I just need sleep.

    Cruising up Nichols Canyon to the pad, cameras and
    copywriters loom on my front lawn.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Press camped out post-Sanderline,
              looking for quotes to hang me with.                     *

    Slouch in the seat, accelerate, keep looking back...dig that
    geek from the Hearld pissing in my hedges.


8   EXT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - MORNING                               8

    Up the walkway.

                        ME (V.O.)
              Retreat to Meg's. My kid sister and
              only living family. Mom and Pop
              died in `51 when their first plane
              ride became their last.

    Scoop Meg's LA Herald of the ground. Headlines condemn me.
    Tuck it under my arm as Meg opens the door:

                        MEG
                  (glances from paper to me)
              I already got the Times inside.

                                                            13.




9   INT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER                         9

    Silver tea-pot over blue flame on olive-drab stove. The Times
    open on the table between us...Same shitty headlines.

                        MEG
              How much is true?

                        ME
              How many times have I lied to you?

                           MEG
              Zero.

    Shrug. Play aloof. Hope it suffices.

                        ME
              You've always liked your Men mean.

     She looks up at me. Feels the shame I shun...                    *

                        ME
              What would Mom and Dad say?

                        ME
              Nothing. That's where I learned it.

    She stands, goes to the stove.

                           MEG
              Poor you.

                        ME
              Yeah, pour me...a cup please.
              Black, no sugar.

    Meg stares darts. I smile to defuse.

                        ME (CONT'D)
              Pretty please.

    She fetches cups and saucers.

                        ME (CONT'D)
              How's work?                                             *

                           MEG
              It's work.

                        ME
              How's Pete?

                                                             14.



                            MEG
               More work.

     Quiet while we wait for the pot...and quiet always means
     creeping sleep: an Enemy I never stop fighting. Force my eyes
     open, shift in my seat: I've been exhausted for years.

     I drift despite my best efforts and for a split second you
     see the Hell I see when sleep wins:


10   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                          10

     Fire where the clouds should be -- POP -- in a backseat,
     point-blank Tommy-gunning two smiling men -- POP -- Marine
     fatigues soaked in blood, plunging my bayonet into a
     cheesecake-white belly -- POP -- that beautiful blonde from       *
     the Olympic, smiling -- POP-                                      *


11   INT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - SAME MOMENT                          11

     -awake. My leg jerks, kicks a big Wing-Tip. A cup of coffee
     pipes in front of me. Then voices. I turn: PETE BONDURANT has
     his hands on my sister's shoulders.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA
               Sheriff. Bounced when he beat-dead
               a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly
               impressed Howard Hughes hired him
               on as his full-time muscle. My
               Sister's new Hump. My oldest living
               Friend.

                         PETE
                   (turns back at me)
               You look like Death taking a shit.

     Meg cackles.

                         MEG
               He's still got that MGM-face.

                         PETE
               You're still the only guy who ever
               traded movie-potential for Police
               work.

                         MEG
               Because in the movies they make you
               pull your punches.

                                                             15.



     Drain my mug. To Pete:

                         ME
               Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight?

                         MEG
               No. We're going to the Cocoanut-

     -Pete puts an extended index finger in front of Meg's lips,
     which she bends backwards.

                         PETE
               'Favor' mean `free?'

                         ME
               Means $500 an hour.

                         MEG
               Gimme the phone so I can find
               another Date-

                          ME
               -you're the only Woman I know who
               calls Men-

                         MEG
               -you're the only Man I know who
               doesn't call Women.

     Pete laughs, then:                                             *

                         PETE
               What are we doing?


12   EXT. LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING, EAST LA - NIGHT            12

     Me and Junior in the car. Pete street-side, tucked into the
     shadows -- mimes jacking off, checks his watch. Everybody
     bored. Glance again at the file in my lap:

                          ME (V.O.)
               Morton Diskant, a man who preferred
               migrant workers to million dollar
               ballparks. Beating Bethune in their
               City Council Race despite getting
               outspent 10 to 1.
                   (beat)
               If he wins, the Dodgers don't get a
               Stadium, Mexicans get to keep
               raising chickens two miles from
               City Hall and Bradley makes sure I                   *
               burn for Sanderline Johnson.                         *

                                                        16.



Junior in the backseat, penning in a steno, mouthing
something to himself.

                    ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Junior brought along because he
          begged. Already hip to how many
          ways you can make money with a
          badge.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          You got a birthday coming up.

                    ME
          What?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          On the 16th, right? How old?

                    ME
          Old. What are you writing?                          *

Head down, scribbling mid-sentence, makes me wait a beat.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Just notes...about work-

                    ME
          -what `work'?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Mostly compare and contrast stuff.
          Street work versus textbook-

                    ME
          -chapter 1: don't write shit down.
          Chapter 2: or other Cops might kill                 *
          you.

Junior's look practiced in a mirror: clicks the pen, slides
the steno away.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          So you think Noonan will come after
          you for the Sanderline thing? He
          seems like a real hard charger.

Bait him, see if he bites.

                    ME
              (the deadest deadpan)
          I heard he was coming after both of
          us.

                                                                17.



     Feature real concern from Junior.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               What?

                         ME
               Indictments. Prison time. Whole
               nine.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Holy Jesus. Is this true?

                         ME
               I'm seriously thinking about
               turning Junior...testifying against
               you.

     Junior goes sour...gets he's being goosed. I laugh, glance
     out the windshield: see Diskant finally exiting the office.

                         ME (CONT'D)
               Here we go.

     I start the car, slow-roll up the street. My Hamilton says
     11:04 PM. Streets deserted. Pete walking in Diskant's
     direction now as I continue to roll toward both. Pete close,
     dig his giant head nodding `hello.'

                         ME (V.O.)
               Seen Pete do this a dozen times and
               every time the same thought:

     Pete suddenly puts his back into an left hook: hammers
     Diskant from nowhere as they pass. Instant-ugly crumble.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               God help me if he ever hits me like
               that.

     Pete hoists Diskant by his waist-band, tosses him in the
     backseat. I accelerate out, obeying every law.

                                                       CUT TO:

     PITCH BLACK. Then a series of strobe-flashbulbs: maybe flesh,
     maybe two bodies, maybe both hairy/pale. Then groaning, then
     flickering fluorescent lights make it all look jaundiced.


13   INT. LOW RENT FUCK-TEL ROOM - SAME MOMENT                    13

     Lights now. Diskant awake, trying to loosen his jaw.

                                                          18.



                    ME (V.O.)
          Junior picked up this Quiff jocking
          other Fags in a Men's Room. But
          Quiff was a Law Student who wanted
          his record kept clean.

Quiff nervous but cooing, dick out, on Diskant's thigh.
Junior just as nervous...reloading a camera.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          He should suck his dick. Y'know?
          Put the icing on it.

A baffled moment as the comment registers.

                    PETE
          What?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Tell me that wouldn't sell
          it...plus he's a Communist.

                    ME
          We're ruining his career, not his
          soul. Reload the camera.

Diskant finally speaks: marble-mouthed. Pushes Quiff away:

                    MORTON DISKANT
          Off me!

Don't waste a second: grab Diskant by the hair, narrate his
immediate future.

                    ME
          Drop out of the City Council race
          or I send these pictures to the
          papers.

Diskant rips his head free. Rage. Blood from his mouth.         *
Scanning the room, sizing up the situation, then:               *

                    MORTON DISKANT
          I'll fight you rotten-

                    ME
          -and maybe salvage something that's
          a close cousin to `respect.' But
          what about your wife and kid
          getting hold of those pictures?

                                                             19.



     Wait for the big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting.
     Diskant just sits. No words. And now I wish he'd cry, throw
     punches, anything...but he doesn't. I turn to Junior:

                         ME (CONT'D)
               Take the Quiff home.

                         QUIFF
               My name's Franklin-

                         ME
               -of course it is.

     Junior pulls Quiff out the door. By his hand. Just Pete, Me,
     and Diskant now. Silent moments drag sour...

                         ME (CONT'D)
               I need a nod from you Morton, let's
               me know you get it-

                         DISKANT
               -don't say my name...

                         PETE
               He gets it.

                         ME
               Someone from the Times will call
               for a quote. Whatever your reason
               for dropping out make it real.

     As Pete and I turn to leave:

                         DISKANT
                   (not looking at us)
               You eventually lose the ability to
               reconcile the things you've done to
               people. That's Hell.

     A long moment on me and Pete. Blunted by what we just heard.


14   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NEXT MOMENT                        14

     Pete driving. Silence. Tune to an all-night Jazz signal, turn
     up the volume loud enough to jumble doubts. Toss Pete his
     cut. A $500 roll.

                         PETE
                   (pocketing the money)
               Y'know Hughes has a job you're
               tailor-made for. I already gave him
               your-

                                                             20.



                         ME
               -no thanks.

                         PETE
               Stop pretending you're not a pig
               for all this, Klein.

                         ME
               I still got a day job, Pete-

                         PETE
               -tossing more Bantamweights out                       *
               windows?

     I wait too long, answer in too high a voice:

                         ME
               The Mutt jumped.

                          PETE
                   (laughs small, then:)
               Not even the people who don't know
               you believe that. If somebody from
               the DA's office decides to dig, you
               could fry Boy-o. Be nice to be in
               with a billionaire who's got a
               fleet of planes, fly you outta the
               country on a moment's notice.

               just wants you to burn some actress
               that stopped fucking him.

     Stop in front of Meg's place. Pete leaves the engine running,
     jumps out.

                         PETE (CONT'D)
               Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm                        *
               It'll be worth it.

     I watch Pete go into Meg's place. Drive on. Stop sign. A
     block away: Black Buick parallel to me. Exhaust plumes. Like
     they're waiting. I keep my eyes on the rear-view as I
     pass...but it just stays put...idling.


15   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - MOMENTS LATER             15

     Lights off but something grabs my eye instantly. Kitchen
     table: a manila envelope. 100 $100-bills. USC season tickets.
     A note: `Thanks for proving Flying Monkeys only live in Oz.
     Sam G.' Exhale. Flip to the same jazz station. Sit. Start
     another futile fight with sleep.

                                                               21.


     The last thing I see before I nod black: my War Trophy, a
     Japanese Officer's Samurai Sword mounted on my mantle.

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


16   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                            16

     Artillery barrages from Hell: Okinawa, 1945. A hate-fueled
     frenzy hacking up half-starved Jap Soldiers. They dive off
     the Cliffs to escape me: this massive, gray-eyed Marine.

     I dive after them. Bombing toward a world below already
     ablaze. Falling. Gaining on a figure in a bathrobe. This
     guttural scream turns mechanical, like a ring as I recognize
     Sanderline Johnson: his pieced-together face smiling up. Snap
     awake. My phone ringing. 1 AM. Rip the phone from the wall:         *

                         BRADLEY (O.S.)
               -you know who Hector Magdalena is?

                         ME
                   (as cobwebs clear)
               ...yeah...Narco's Snitch.

                         BRADLEY (O.S.)
               He's missing. His home was broken
               into at some point within the last
               hour.

                         ME
               So send Robbery.

                         BRADLEY (O.C.)
               The only thing taken was him.
               Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get
               over there right now.

                           ME
               Why me?

                         BRADLEY
               Call it penance.

                         ME
               I thought that's what Morton
               Diskant was-

                         BRADLEY
               -that makes one of us. 1284 South                         *

                         BRADLEY (cont'd)
                   (edge to his voice)
               This kind of timing makes for
               disasters, Lieutenant.

     I hear the first split-second of Bradley smashing his phone
     down. Click my own cradle. Wipe my face. Dial another number.

17   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - LATE NIGHT 17

     Police abound. Mostly work-a-day Blues pounding coffee. They
     part as I approach: Dave "Enforcer" Klein half-legend here. A
     plain-clothes breaks through, aims right at me: DAN WILHITE.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the
               LAPD Narcotics Division. A Michigan
               Catholic poisoned by 25 years in
               this desert. Recently divorced
               despite seven kids with his Ex.

                         WILHITE
               Why are you here?

                         ME
               You smell like bourbon Wilhite-

                         WILHITE
               -fuck off. This is handled. And
               pull your idiot partner out of
               there-

                         ME
               -Junior's already here-

                         WILHITE
               -Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's
               my scene.

     -push past him, toward the house.

                         ME
               Then get Bradley on the horn, so
               you can relay that order. I'm here
               on his word. Now, what happened?

                         WILHITE
                   (dragged out of him)
               Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena's
               missing.

                                      23.



          ME
And presumed what?

          WILHITE
I could give a shit. I just want to
this case to get a quick burial.

          ME
I'll bet. Who made the call?

          WILHITE
Some old broad heard an `argument'
and buzzed Wilshire Station.                *

          ME
Where's the family?

          WILHITE
The wife and daughter were in Santa
Barbara. Just got back.

          ME
    (check my Hamilton)
At 2 AM?                                    *

          WILHITE                           *
The Wife said she got into a fight          *
with her Parents, left ASAP.                *

          ME                                *
Why wasn't Hector with `em?                 *

          WILHITE
What do you think they were                 *
fighting about? Santa Barbara Wasps         *
don't fancy dope-pushing Wetbacks.

          ME
What about the Son?                         *

          WILHITE
    (sneering hatred)
Tommy. Make him your #1 suspect.

          ME
Why's that?                                 *

          WILHITE
He's got a mean streak. And he and          *
Hector had been at each others
throats for months. Have Tommy              *
picked up. He likes to loaf at              *
those nigger jazz joints in Watts.          *

                                                             24.



                         ME
               Alright, you better cut out before                      *
               people start asking why the head of
               Narco is at a missing persons.

     Wilhite gets close, still sneering:

                         WILHITE
               Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and
               pin this thing fast or you'll have
               a whole division of disgraced cops
               at your front door.

                         ME
               What are you talking about Wilhite?

                         WILHITE
               You queered the Fed's   Fight Probe
               by killing that boxer   and they
               already had a hard-on   for the LAPD-                   *
               Bradley sent you down   here as
               damaged goods...think   about it.
               Everybody sees what's   coming.
                   (beat, closer)
               Now close this quick.

     Wilhite bolts. I pause. Clarity finally dissolving the            *
     bloodshot: this is the disaster Bradley was talking about:        *

                         ME (V.O.)
               The God-sized problems I triggered
               tossing Sanderline take shape: the
               LAPD's sanctioned dope-pusher
               vanishes -- that's a pretty juicy                       *
               spot to stick a new probe.                              *


18   INT. MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER                     18

     All money, no taste. In the foyer: a Wilshire Station six-
     pack interviews the old BIDDIE in a threadbare bathrobe. Dyed
     orange hair and a burnt-butter grin. Leans-lunges as she
     relays her story. I zoom in to catch the performance.

                         BIDDIE
                   (mid-sentence)
               -shifty...colored...y'know Negros
               are planning an invasion! After our
               white women and our water supply-

                         OFFICER
               -where was this Peeper you saw?

                                                        25.



                    BIDDIE
          Bushes. Spyin' on Lucille. Seen him                   *
          there before! He's a black saboteur                   *
          looking for fertile white wombs.
          Wanna breed a mulatto master race-                    *

-cut into the crazy:

                       ME
          Officer.

The Six-Pack crosses to confer.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          Besides bat-shit insanity, is there
          anything else about her that rings
          true?

                    OFFICER
          Heard an argument, loud, maybe a
          minute or two, then silence.

                    ME
          What's this `Peeper' riff she's on?

                    OFFICER
          She saw someone in the bushes
          earlier. She's reported that kind
          of thing a dozen other times. She's
          also reported flying saucers, so...

                    ME
          See if any of the other Neighbors
          can verify this `Peeper' thing.                       *

Roam. A hallway. Junior the grim-faced professional, He's got
that damn steno out, scribbling like he's on a deadline.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          No one touch a thing `til I say.

He's hovering over a lake of blood, drag marks originating in
that lake lead out to the garage. Junior sees me. See him
startle, then jut his tough-guy chin on reflex:

                       JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
          Dave-

                    ME
          -Lieutenant Klein. I said `meet me'
          in twenty minutes' not `go in
          without me.'

                                                        26.



                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          All I've been doing-

                    ME
              (hard/harsh/low)
          -is stepping on dicks. You don't
          know the history, the players or
          the play.

Pull Junior aside, impart the following tightly:

                    ME (CONT'D)
          The Department gave Magdalena a                      *
          monopoly on the LA dope trade
          decades ago-

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          -what Department?

                    ME
          Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet-
          proofed him in exchange for 60% of
          his profit and a promise he only
          deal drugs in Darktown and East LA-                  *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          -Black and Mexican-

                     ME
          -give the man a prize. He'd also                     *
          rat his competition and kill the
          ones we couldn't convict.
          Now keep your mouth shut and stay
          on my hip.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *
          Fine.                                                *

I want to bounce his head off the wall. I continue my tour
instead. Follow the blood-trail out into the garage where it   *
ends in another smaller lake of blood.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                   *
          Loaded him into a car-

                    ME
          -are all the Magdalena vehicles
          accounted for?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Except for the Son's: Tommy.                         *

                                                        27.



Continue the tour. Kitchen. Two Dobermans, shot dead. Feature
matching bullet wounds right between their eyes -- yell to      *
the Officer with the Biddie:                                    *

                     ME
          OFFICER.

As he pokes his head around the corner:

                    ME (CONT'D)
          The old lady hear dogs barking?                       *
          Gunshots?

                    OFFICER
          No, I asked. Just the yelling.

Examine the wounds closer. Catch myself petting the deceased
pooches. To Junior:

                    ME
          She didn't hear barking...so they
          were either lousy guard dogs...or
          they knew the Killer.
              (point to the wounds)
          You can't hit something this clean
          unless you're point blank. He
          could've been petting them when he
          fired: look at the burn pattern-                      *
              (point)
          Like when you shoot something with
          a silencer.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          How do you know that?

                    ME
              (stare so he gets it)
          I've shot things with silencers...
          And the old lady didn't hear any                      *
          gunshots.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          You make a family member for it?
          Tommy?

                     ME
          Maybe...                                              *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Do you want to issue an APB?

                                                             28.



                         ME
               I want to talk to Bradley first.
               Where are the Mother and Daughter?                   *


19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             19

     Feature this old Matriarch hanging by the thinnest thread:     *
     MADGE MAGDALENA, fifty-plus, dyed blonde bouffant pulled at
     and picked. Sad clown tears smearing too much mascara. She
     pitches a boo-hoo in between belts of wine to a bored stiff
     Wilshire Station six-pack.

     LUCILLE MAGDALENA, 20's: Daughter. Big bedroom eyes. A top
     two sizes too tight. Pops a palm of pills. Doesn't look too
     shattered about Daddy's demise. I make eye contact. I catch    *
     bruises on her arms. She sees me see, tries to cover           *
     nonchalant. The wall phone rings. Grab without asking.         *

                         ME
               It's Klein.

                         BRADLEY (O.S.)
               Update.

                         ME
               Hector's gone. Blood that may or
               may not be his leads out to the                      *
               garage. Two guard dogs shot dead
               but no other signs of a struggle.
               The house is intact.

                         BRADLEY
               Family?

                         ME
               Wife and Daughter are here.

                         BRADLEY
               Describe their state.

                         ME
               Mother Madge aggrieved.                              *
                   (aim my gaze at Lucille)
               Daughter Lucille...indifferent. The                  *
               son is persona non grata and a
               strong early suspect.

                         BRADLEY
               Alright, kick everyone out.
               Including all police personnel.

                                                             29.



                         ME
               How's that?

                         BRADLEY
               Don't question me. Is your partner
               on hand?

                         ME
               Yeah...                                               *

                         BRADLEY
               Have him bag and seal everything
               and bring it to Wilshire Station.
               Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and
               take him into custody. No APB's,
               nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI
               to this situation.

                         ME
               You want me to-

                         BRADLEY
               -no more information over an open                     *
               line. I'll be at the Bethune event
               later on today. Find me there.

     Click. Second time he's hung up on me in an hour. Pull Junior
     to me just as he's going through a stack of mail:

                         ME
               I'm giving you on-scene command.                      *
               Bradley wants everyone removed from
               the premises and the entire house
               bagged for evidence and brought to
               Wilshire Station.
                   (more of a dare)
               Can you handle this?

     Big brown-nose nods from an aim-to-please Junior.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Entirely. Where are you going?

                         ME
               To find Tommy Magdalena.


20   INT. CAR - EARLY MORNING                                  20

     Rolling up Hollywood to Highland.

                                                               30.



                         KLEIN (V.O.)
               Big yawns. Half haze from no sleep.
               Buzz dispatch. A message from Pete.
               `Reminder: Hughes aircraft, 7 PM.                      *

     Glance street-side: Sanderline smiling blood in a wind blown
     bathrobe. Blink and he's gone, replaced by a kid hawking the
     Times.

     Pull-over. Toss the kid a coin. Front page: LEADING CANDIDATE
     BOWS FROM CITY COUNCIL RACE, next to a picture of Diskant.
     Pissed for reasons I won't name. Back to the Car. A Black
     Buick passes, slower than the rest of traffic, act like I'm
     oblivious. It turns. I slide in, start my Pontiac.

                          ME (V.O.)
               Another Black Buick. Call it a Fed                     *
               Tail. Noonan already up my ass.                        *
                   (beat)
               Let's see if they got guts enough
               to keep following me South.


21   EXT. DARKTOWN - DAWN                                        21

     Cruising the Crenshaw district, up through Central Ave.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Dispatch gave me Tommy's make and
               model: A `32 Ford Deuce with a bent
               eight. Hot-rodder Tommy liked to
               goose the cops into giving chase.

     Check my mirrors. That Black Buick hangs way back. Cruise
     past jazz clubs: The Savoy, Joe Morris's Plantation, Shepp's
     Playhouse, the Down Beat...no sign of a Ford Deuce. Pull up
     to the Club Alabam. Valets stare: a white man in Watts at
     this hour can only be Cop. Park.                                 *

     Half-a-block back: buzzcuts in that black Buick.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Noonan tail confirmed: Fed faces                       *
               glow like Martians this far down

22   INT. CLUB ALABAM - DAWN                                     22

     Barely sober patrons sport Cop-hate stares, some on reflex,      *
     some because of Sanderline Johnson.                              *

                                                        31.


Doorman escort the bewildered, strong-arm the belligerent.      *
Almost 6 AM and the club is still half full.

Press on, scan the stage: A Bebop trio toils over an Erroll
Garner tune as a beautiful black girl sings in a satin soft
lilt. This whispering falsetto that makes your hair stand on
end. I stop and listen. Get my only smile of the day from       *
her. Smile back because her voice reminds me to.

Hear beer bottles rattle behind and break. Turn. Squeeze that
smile into a sneer, stare down this massive BARTENDER.          *

                    ME
              (flop badge on bar)
          Get Lester and get me a scotch                        *
          straight.                                             *

The bartender glowers, grabs a bottle, pours, hands the size    *
of catcher's mitts. He slides the glass. I sip.                 *

                    BARTENDER
          Sanderline Johnson was my second                      *
          cousin, Peckerwood. I wouldn't                        *
          drink that with my gun hand.

He vanishes behind a stained curtain. Feel those voodoo         *
stares from behind...and I switch the scotch glass to my left   *
hand as nonchalant as possible. Bartender reappears, motions
me back. I follow. Backstage. I see a figure stretched prone,
ice-pack pressed to his face, rolled reefer between his lips.

                    ME (V.O.)
          Lester Lake. One-time velvet voiced
          crooner. But a dabble in the dope
          trade cost him a set of slashed
          vocal cords at the hands of none                      *
          other than Hector Magdalena.                          *

Only as I get closer do I see the badly swollen black eye. He
looks up at me. A voice like sand-paper left out in the sun:    *

                    LESTER LAKE
          Lieutenant Dave Klein. Slayer of                      *
          Sanderline Johnson...y'got stones                     *
          showing up this far South.                            *

                    ME
          What happened to your face?

                     LESTER LAKE
              (beat)
          Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I
          understood something he was saying.

                                                        32.



                    ME
          Where is he?

                    LESTER LAKE
          Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe.

                    ME
          Shit. He's wise.

                    LESTER LAKE
          To what? You looking for him?

Lester hands me the reefer, take it, toke geeky, belch smoke.

                    ME
              (at the reefer)
          Just never got this...

Lester takes it back, draws deep.

                    LESTER LAKE
          Too white to appreciate good grass.                   *

Now watch Lester's attitude improve toot sweet:

                    ME
          Hector Magdalena is missing,
          presumed dead. Tommy is our sole
          suspect.

He spurts smoke, sits up like a shot, beams.                    *

                    LESTER LAKE
          Muthafucker -- there is a God.
          If only I'd known this an hour ago.

                    ME
          Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig
          here last night?

                    LESTER LAKE
          I don't let him, he just does.
          Nails on a chalkboard too. He
          rushed the stage last week when we
          had Charlie Mingus drop in for a
          set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex                   *
          greaser kid trying to play `Round                     *
          Midnight,' said that fool couldn't                    *
          find them keys with a flashlight.'

                    ME
          Tommy's playing days are over.

                                      33.



          LESTER LAKE
Hallelujah.

          ME
What time did he show up?

          LESTER LAKE
Around four. Him and these Pachucos         *
poppin' switchblades like punks.
    (mops his brow of blood)
The only thing that was keepin' him         *
`untouched' was Hector...                   *
    (beat, hopeful-prayer)
Is he really dead?                          *

          ME
There's blood all over his house,
seems to belong to him. There's
just no body. Not yet.

          LESTER LAKE
    (a toke, a thought)
I don't feature Tommy for it.               *

          ME
    (my head kinks a bit)                   *
How's that? How many times has he           *
been in here, busted you up?

          LESTER LAKE
Yeah, but he ain't got the salt             *
to truly take a Man's life.                 *
Especially not Hector's...he was            *
scared of him.                              *

          ME                                *
Why?                                        *

          LESTER LAKE                       *
`Cuz Hector been whippin' Tommy's           *
ass from the time he could talk.            *

          ME                                *
What about the Wife? Beat her too?          *

          LESTER LAKE                       *
We used to call that old bitch `the         *
Burglar'...eyes were so black, it           *
looked like she had a mask on.              *

          ME                                *
And the daughter? Lucille?                  *

                                                        34.



Lester can't quip that one as quick. Tokes. Shaking his head.   *

          Things up off the street. Rumors.                     *

          Hector had turned her out. Using                      *
          her the way the Romans used to use                    *
          their daughters when they did                         *
          business: Some pussy to sweeten the                   *
          pot. Rumor was she got picked up in                   *
          this trick sweep few weeks back.                      *

                    ME                                          *
          Hector was whoring her?                               *

                    LESTER LAKE                                 *
          Hector was an evil Muthafucker.                       *

...Lester tilts his neck back, points to a long keloid scar     *
that stretches across his throat...                             *

                    LESTER LAKE (CONT'D)                        *

          And if he really is dead and gone,                    *
          this game `bout to explode.                           *

                    LESTER LAKE
          Drugs. Especially here in South
          Central. Hector ran it uncontested.
          Lotta cats gonna rush in now, try
          to plant a flag.                                      *

               Eyes and ears for me Lester. He
               turns up, you get in touch.

23   EXT. UNION STATION BALLROOM - DAY                            23

     Bethune Campaign Fundraiser turned Victory Bash. Big smiles
     beam above sunburned double-chins. Bethune the nucleus of a
     Press circle-jerk. I weave around, lack of sleep and a
     miserably wrinkled suit make me look like something dug up.

                         REPORTER #1
               Councilman Bethune, was Mr. Diskant
               dropping out the only way you could
               have won this race?

                         TOM BETHUNE
               Not at all. My message of civic
               advancement manifested in that
               beautiful blue baseball team was
               starting to hit home.

     Bethune's beam twitches when he sees me weaving past. Give
     him a quick nod, get nothing back: he can't be seen this
     close to the turd in the punch bowl. Moving by:

                         REPORTER #3
               Anything you'd like to say to
               future constituents?

                         TOM BETHUNE
               I like my Dodger Dogs with mustard
               and relish!

     Bradley at one of the front tables confabbing with DA Gas
     Chamber Bob Gallaudet. As I aim their way, one of my favorite     *
     men aims at me, wearing this Great White grin: FRITZ KOENIG.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Fritz Koenig. German born. Former                       *
               US Spymaster, current Head of the                       *
               LAPD's Intelligence Division. He                        *
               and Bradley in the middle of their
               own Cold War -- each fighting to be
               the second most important member of                     *
               the LAPD behind Chief Parker.                           *

                                                  36.



                    KOENIG                              *
          These functions aren't normally               *
          open to Jews.                                 *

          never be allowed to say `Jew'                 *
          again.                                        *

                    KOENIG                              *
          That accent allowed me to execute             *
          many a Nazi.                                  *

          Island said Grandpa's `Kleinsasser'           *
          was two syllables too long.                   *

                    KOENIG
          I wouldn't have expected so public
          a showing after Sanderline Johnson.

                    ME
          He jumped Fritz.

Koenig flashes that grin again.

                    KOENIG
          I'm sure he did. And where is your
          young partner this day?

                    ME
          Working his first big job.

                    KOENIG
          Might the job involve the LAPD's
          most important missing Wetback,
          Hector Magdalena?

My eyes narrow but stay smiling:

                     ME
          It does.

Koenig nods, casts his gaze out over the crowd.

                    KOENIG
          I've known Stemmons since the
          academy. He was a top pupil. A                *
          peculiar little pain in the ass,
          but very good with details.

                                                        37.



                     ME
          Kid might have some climb in him.
               (look back at Bradley)
          Reminds me of another pain in the
          ass.

Koenig roars this big frightening laugh of his.

                    KOENIG
          I'm puzzled as to why the Bradley
          would assign you to the Magdalena                     *
          case when you're neither Homicide
          nor Robbery...

                    ME
          There's no body, and nothing was
          taken except Hector.

                    KOENIG
          He does know how to delegate
          doesn't he...and also I'm sure that
          poor Negro's nosedive has put you
          squarely in his debt.

                    ME
          Something like that.                                  *

                    KOENIG
          Keep me abreast will you? Chief
          Parker is understandably nervous.
          Situations like these tend to yield
          grief...and we've the FBI poking                      *
          around our garden patch.                              *

                    ME
          My ass first Fritz, yours second.

Koenig's big laugh again. Moving toward Bradley now. Then
flashbulbs pop-blind. Panic: snapping pix of me? Relief: not
me. Hollywood types: this Buff McMan Meat-type and Her. I go
slack inches from the Press that yesterday wanted to roll in
my guts...but now they're just as entranced with her as I am.

She and McMan Meat continue past as I stare, she answers his
questions for him. I think her eyes see mine. Then I realize
where I'm standing. Bradley waiting. Focused on me and not
her -- God-damned Eunuch. I step over, speak without preface:

                    ME (CONT'D)
          Tommy Magdalena has gone to ground
          and he's got a war chest to keep
          him there. The only way we take him
          quickly is to issue a citywide APB-

                                      38.



          BRADLEY
-no. We can't risk that. Do you             *
make him for the murderer?

          ME
Yeah. Hector's disappearance is
definitely an inside job. That
whole family feels hinky. The
daughter was all bruises and no

looks part punching bag.

          BRADLEY
Do you suspect either of the women?         *

          ME
According to Wilhite, they were in
Santa Barbara at the time.

          BRADLEY
Verify that. Where is your partner?

          ME
Vouching in evidence at Wilshire
Station.

           BRADLEY
Keep him on that. He had excellent
ratings as an evidence teacher and          *
I trust him more than you.
    (beat)
Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus
everything on that effort & I want
him apprehended Klein, not killed.

          ME
What about Hector? Still missing.

          BRADLEY
And most likely dead. Find the Son.         *
Stakeout the residence. Put tails
on both the mother and daughter --
I want this investigation working
quietly, and around the clock.

          ME                                *
And what do we do if Hector turns           *
up?                                         *

                                                        39.

          If he's alive, bring him to me. If
          he's dead, have him John Doe'd at                    *
          the morgue until Noonan can be                       *

                    ME
          Wilhite. He was operating Hector-

                    BRADLEY
          -don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You
          deal directly with me. Now go out
          the back. I don't want the press
          recognizing you.

Swallow my sneer. Push through the service doors. Hard.
Headed back toward the kitchen, an exit sign. I pass an
alcove: Her. Alone. Smoke break. Beauty you almost never get
to examine up close. I stop, stammer, she gives me a once-
over, thinks I'm a Reporter...

                    ME
          You got a light?

                    WOMAN
              (searches my empty hands)
          You got a cigarette?

I fumble for a Chesterfield. She pulls a Zippo slow.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          If you snap a picture of me, I get
          to set you on fire. Fair?

I smile too wide -- fuck. I kill it, try to gather up the
bits of `cool' that shattered with the sophomore smile.

                    ME
          It didn't look like you were all
          that upset with the attention.

                    WOMAN
          Good thing you're not a cop.

                     ME
              (beat)
          How's that?

                    WOMAN
          Your power of observation leaves
          lots to be desired.

                                                             40.



     Lights my cigarette. I hold it in my mouth to hide shaking
     hands.

                            ME
               Thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Don't thank me: these things are
               bad for you.

                         ME
               You believe everything you read?

     Stubs her cigarette.

                         WOMAN
               You believe anything you read?

     She starts walking back the way I came.

                         ME
                   (hail-mary)
               Do you eat Dinner?

                            WOMAN
               No.

     I can't stop watching her, even after she pushes back through
     the double doors, re-entering the fray head-first. I step
     after her. A reporter finally makes me. Random catcalls of
     `Klein! `Hey, Enforcer!' Shutterbugs beeline my way, firing
     flashbulbs from the hip. Close the door quick and bolt.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Make a note: steal Bethune's guest-                     *
               list, then go door-to-door until                        *
               you find her again.


24   INT. WILSHIRE STATION - DAY                                  24

     Stroll. Sidelong stares on the periphery. Muted whispers from     *
     desk cops. Feature this rookie chump clear a path as I pass.      *
     Down a flight of stairs to the evidence lockers. Junior
     writes seizure abstracts, sealing materials in green-banded       *
     evidence bags. A pile stacked neatly on the table next to
     him. That red steno pad in full view.

                         ME
               This everything from the house?

     A beat. He makes me wait as he finishes writing.

                                      41.



          JUNIOR STEMMONS
Everything worthwhile.

          ME
What did you tell the Watch
Commander upstairs?

          JUNIOR STEMMONS
    (schoolboy proud)
That this was a random drug
seizure. I'm not using names and
I'm number coding everything.
A load of interesting stuff too.
    (points to each stack)
I got unregistered fire-arms, more
dope than I've ever seen, and some
mail from business associates that
seems hinky. We should follow up-           *
    (grabs an envelope)                     *
-here, this one, `Hurwitz Holdings'         *
Hector had some real estate
dealings-

           ME
-bag it until Bradley orders us
otherwise.

          JUNIOR STEMMONS
    (like I'm speaking Greek)               *
How do you solve a case when the
evidence is in bags?

          ME
You don't. Our job is to find
Tommy.
    (point to the red steno)
And why is that out?

          JUNIOR STEMMONS
    (like he's caught)
I'm making notes separate from-
    (gear change off my glare)
-I thought we were investigating
Magdalena's disappearance-

          ME
-Don't write shit down. What do you         *
need Kid? A little bouncing ball,           *
bottom of the screen?                       *
    (brace him harder)
Magdalena is twenty years dirty
with this Department...do you think         *
a word of that exists on paper?

                                                             42.



                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               ...No.

                         ME                                            *
               And there's reasons. Respect them.                      *

     Junior tucks the steno away, chastened.

                          ME (CONT'D)                                  *
               Now we need surveillance set up on
               the house and revolving tails on
               both Madge and Lucille Magdalena.
               Their alibi is they were in Santa
               Barbara when Hector vanished. Find
               out if that's real. The tails and
               the stakeout start tonight.
                   (beat)
               Can you manage this?

     Junior jacks his chin just high enough to save face, tucks
     that steno away, this X-Ray stare.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Sure, Lieutenant.                                       *

     Cruise in, crossing the hangar to Pete.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Howard Hughes. Billionaire germ
               freak. Boob man. Pete's prime

          lawyers he kept on staff.

A small, effete blonde man: GEOFFREY MILTEER extends his tiny
hand, plastic-cordial, rubbed raw from waiting...                *

                    MILTEER
          Gregory Milteer. Attorney-at-Law. A
          pleasure Lt. Klein.

          Dave. Sorry I'm late.                                  *

          Indeed.
              (motions to sit)
          Please.

We sit at a huge drafting table. I shoot a sidelong to Pete.

                    MILTEER (CONT'D)
          Thanks for your time on a Sunday.

                    ME
              (a wink for Pete)
          Where's Mr. Hughes?

                    MILTEER
          Unavailable. Unfortunately. But
          I've been given full authority to-

                    ME
          -I'm not contagious...if that's
          what he's worried about.

Pete hate scowls me: have your fun, Asshole...

                    MILTEER
          I don't find that the least bit
          humorous Lt. Klein.

                    ME
          Yes you do. What's your pitch Mr.                      *
          Milteer?

Milteer looks at Pete. Pete half-shrugs. Back to me now:

                                                44.



                    MILTEER
          An `Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe
          signed a Service Contract that
          she's now willfully violating by
          acting in a Z-grade horror picture
          presently `shooting' in Griffith
          Park. Despite entreaties for her to
          cease participation in this
          absurdity, she continues to revel
          in her outlaw status with us. Thus
          we would like her destroyed.

                    ME
          What makes you think I can do a
          better job than your people?

                    MILTEER
          Mr. Bondurant says you're one of
          the smarter people he knows-

                     ME
          -dubious honor if you knew the
          other people Pete knows.
              (beat)
          So you want to catch her in
          violation of her Service Contract?
          Something like that?

                    MILTEER
          Exactly. The morality clause in
          particular as the damage to her
          reputation would be most
          devastating: Nymphomaniac,
          Criminal, Communist...anything
          along these lines. Once you visit
          the set of her `Attack of the
          Atomic Vampires,' you'll see the
          void that is her character. We
          haven't a photograph handy, but
          she's playing the lead female role.         *

                    ME
          I'm happy to help. But my price is
          $10,000. Not 5.

Pete laughs out loud. Milteer goes frigid.

                    MILTEER
          $10,000 should buy more than help.

                                                             45.



                         ME
               For 10 give it any name you want.
               I'm a salaried employee of LAPD,                      *
               that means I'll have to find time
               off hours to do this.

     A long, cold moment drags...                                    *

                         MILTEER
               Agreed. Start tonight. Someone's                      *
               been stealing groceries from our
               talent domiciles. There's no proof
               that it's her, but it's her. Peter
               will provide you addresses.

                         ME
                   (faux fey)
               Thank you Peter.

                         MILTEER
               We look forward to your updates.

28   EXT. ATOMIC VAMPIRE SET - DUSK                            28

     Two-fisting coffees. On top of a hill overlooking the `Atomic
     Vampires' shoot. Pure schlock. The spaceship: a totaled
     Cadillac replete with home-made canopy and cardboard
     extensions on the fins. Crew: homeless winos. Extras:
     homeless drug-fiends. Scan the assembled `talent'...and see:

     HER. My black and white picture. The Beauty at the fight. The
     starlet I threw a Hail Mary dinner pass to at Bethune's
     victory party: GLENDA BLEDSOE. Emerging from a small trailer.

     HER laughing. Melodic. I hike down through the bramble.


29   EXT. ATOMIC VAMPIRE SET - DUSK                               29

     Walk past a pair of beat Airstream Clippers. Watch her
     propping up this silver-haired junkie. She grabs a sound
     blanket, drapes him, hands him her coffee before siting down
     next to another Woman and rehearsing.

     I eyeball the rest of the `set.' Winos in werewolf masks and
     capes, holding wooden ray-guns spray-painted silver: One
     pisses, bottle in one hand, cigarette/dick in the other.

     The "Director" is a fey manic, fingering a snuff-box.

               I need everybody's energy up, up
               up! Where's my Alien Commander?

     The Pissing WEREWOLF careens back to set, pulling at his

          see `out.' How the mighty have
          fallen.

                    MICKEY COHEN
              (gives it right back)
          Which one of us are you talking
          about Klein? Word is the Federal
          Bureau is all hot and bothered with
          you Gonif. Hey, I hear J. Edgar
          schtups his personal assistant and
          makes him wear ladies hose.

                    ME
          What else are you hearing?

                    MICKEY COHEN
          That this Welles Noonan character
          has developed quite a crush. That
          you might want to consider
          relocating to Dogdick, Delaware.

                    ME
          Been a marked man for years Mick.

                    MICKEY COHEN
          But the bullseye on your back's
          never been quite so big...if you
          need a new line of work, I got this
          faygele leading man needs replacing-

-follow Mickey's gaze over to ROCK ROCKWELL. Buff McMan Meat-   *
the guy with Glenda at the Bethune party. He's primping with    *
other boys decked in surplus SS uniforms, checking the side     *
mirror of one of the `Alien craft' before his big close-up.     *

                    MICKEY COHEN
          His agent told me he could play
          straight.

                    ME                                          *
          His agent lied.                                       *

                    MICKEY COHEN                                *
          You interested?                                       *

                    ME
          No. But I am interested in your                       *
          leading lady. Bradley sent me. Saw                    *
          her at the Bethune-

                                                             48.



                         MICKEY COHEN
               -not a chance. I'm still trying to
               play hide the submarine.

                         ME
               You want Chief Bradley angry?

                          MICKEY COHEN
               Ten years ago I could call for that                   *
               little Pisher's head on a stick.
                   (looks around)
               And now...

                         ME
               And now the only thing you're
               putting on sticks are corn dogs.
               What's her name, Mick?

                         MICKEY COHEN
               Glenda.

                         ME
                   (still looking for HER)                           *
               Why was she there?

                         MICKEY COHEN
               Low-budget strategy: I send Glenda
               and Rock to any event where there's
               cameras -- Glenda gets guest-a'-
               honor treatment everywhere with
               that shape a' her's...

                         ME
               What she drive?


30   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NIGHT                              30

     Following the tail-lights of a 56 Corvette. Top-down,
     whipping Blond hair split-second visible under passing street
     lights. Glenda pulls into what I guess is her place: tiny-
     tidy Glendale flat. I roll past: no eye contact.

     Around the block. Park on the next street over. Waiting until
     I think of what comes next...get out now...


31   EXT. GLENDALE - NEXT MOMENT                               31

     Up to a fence. Scratch it: make sure a nuts-hungry Pooch
     isn't slobbering on the other side. Nothing. Vault the fence.
     Dodge a pool. Over another fence and into-

                                                             49.




32   EXT. GLENDA'S BACKYARD - NEXT MOMENT                      32

     -creep to a window: curtains pulled. Creep to another: there
     she is. Watch her: elegant fingers emanate from hands only
     now beginning to betray age. Watch her shake her sandals off.
     Arranging three coffee cups on a tray: company coming.

     On cue: another car. A `53 Cadillac: the Director and Rock
     Rockwell. I crane my neck to get as much of her as I can. She
     leaves the tray, cups steaming. Muffled greetings. Check the
     window, open. Slide it up gentle.


33   INT. TINY LIVING ROOM - SAME MOMENT                       33

     Glenda clearing seats.

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               Coffee's in the kitchen. Let's go
               over this quick because I'm beat.

                         DIRECTOR
               We're set on a place where we can
               stash you and Rock. It's in Topanga
               Canyon, two weeks-

                         ROCKWELL
                   (petulant)
               -two weeks? My body'll fall apart-

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               -think of it as 14 days of push-ups-
                   (to the Director)
               Are you sure about this Sid? Seems
               shaky. Was this Mickey's idea?

                         DIRECTOR
               And I think it's brilliant!
               Inspired! The two leads of Mickey
               Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped!
               The press'll eat it up! They'll
               write about `Gangster Mickey,' the
               glory days. Couple a' headlines
               like that and interest in Atomic
               Vampires will go through the roof!
                   (to Glenda)
               Who's gonna grab you?

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               A charmer I knew in another
               life...George Ainge.

                                                             50.



     Pat myself down for a pen, scribble on my hand: "A-I-N-G-E"

                         SID FRIZELL
               Is he okay with making it look real-

                         ROCKWELL
               -he can't hit me in the face!                         *
               That's a deal-breaker!

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               He'll be thrilled to knock me
               around. Plus he's holding something
               of mine, so we can kill two birds.
               He'll grab us Tuesday in front of
               the Pacific Dining Car.                               *

                         ROCKWELL
               What about Hughes?

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               What about him? That angle can only
               help us.

                         SID FRIZELL
               I'm dying to know...was he the
               Spruce Goose between the sheets?


34   EXT. GLENDA'S BACKYARD - SAME MOMENT                      34

     My face folds up -- jealous-sour frown. I reach in, steal one   *
     of the steaming cups, bolt. Audible as I retreat:

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE (O.C.)
               Hung like a newborn and he called
               my tits `propellers.'

     Belly laughter from inside.

                         ME (V.O.)
               The real howler: fake kidnappings
               always bomb.


35   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NIGHT                              35

     Parked. Tepid pulls off the stolen mug. Done. Toss it to the    *
     passenger side: lands on a bed of crumpled Styrofoam. Look
     up: the Magdalena residence looms a few doors down. Glance at
     the passenger seat: an envelope lined with fifty $100 bills.
     The name: BLEDSOE written across the front. Pick it up.

                                                             51.



                         ME (V.O.)
               Thinking I could tip Milteer off to
               the kidnap plot and pick up the
               other half of my payment...
                   (stare at that money)
               Thinking I should just give the
               first half back now...'cuz I know
               right now I'll never hurt her.

     Toss the envelope into the glove-box, slam it shut. Scan. Two
     heads in one of the unmarked patrol cars I ordered. Cursory
     nods as they pass. Tail-lights fade. Dead quiet save my low
     Jazz. Fighting my drift. Check my Hamilton. 10:00. Grimace.       *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               No sense of time. Exhaustion steals
               it. A full hour earlier than I told                     *
               Junior to meet me. I need sleep.                        *

     Yawn. Look up...Lucille Magdalena at her window. Sudden.          *
     Startling: no blouse, pig-tails, big silver-dollar nipples
     touch/steam glass. Pushes the curtains back even further.
     Adrenaline cuts through the lactic acid: wide awake now.

     I see her eyes aren't sex-placid or rolled back -- they're
     scanning -- hopeful to glimpse someone outside looking back.      *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                            *
               This routine had been done before.
               That old broad babbling about a
               Peeper. The only other link to
               Hector Magdalena's disappearance.                       *

     She holds her scan for a blink, a different smile, eyes sex-
     placid now, rolled-back now -- she just saw what she was
     looking for: hidden eyes staring back at her. I look to where
     I saw her gaze kink...unholster my .45. Get out quiet.


36   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT               36

     Cold for LA. Walking/scanning, .45 flush against my leg.
     Sticking to shadows. Cross the street: two homes down. Quiet
     steps. Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter...

     Glance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm
     shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my
     head. Nose-first into asphalt. Too angry to black out. Spit       *
     blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning:

                         ME
               STOP-

                                                         52.



Still unsure what hit me. Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of
gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting
away: PEEPER. Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   *
finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly. Tuck the gun use my     *
left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim:

POP-POP-POP. The Peeper pitches. Visible in the streetlight:
a red puff off his right shoulder. Headlights at end of the
block, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8.      *
Peeper fighting for balance, keeps running.

I sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail,
panting, bleeding my own trail. Lift my eyes to see the
Peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard.
Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. I cross the street-

-those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick. I    *
look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel.
I bounce off like someone yanked a leash. Crumble-yell. Hands
pick me up. I fight back before I even see at whom I'm
swinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies.    *

Welles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick.
Punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to
write home about. My gun clatters to the ground.

                    WELLES NOONAN
          That's for Sanderline Johnson.

                    ME
              (nod at the Peeper trail)
          ARE YOU BLIND-

                    WELLES NOONAN
          -what were you firing at?

                    ME
          The only lead on Magdalena -- we're
          after the same guy you idiot!

                    WELLES NOONAN
              (to one of the goons)
          -write that name down: `Magda-LEE-
          na' or `Magda-LAY-na.'
              (back to me)
          No, we were after you. But thanks
          for the name.

Sag under the weight of my own insomnia-fed stupidity.          *

                                                               53.



                          ME (V.O.)
               Assumed the Feds were smart.
               Assumed they were ready to stick a
               new probe into the LAPD's deal with
               Hector, like Bradley warned, like
               everyone feared. But they had no                        *
               clue and I just handed them the
               whole God damn thing.
                   (beat)
               Like I said: I need sleep...

     Raise my face now, eyes intent, chin out.

                         ME (CONT'D)
               First punch you ever thrown Noonan?
               Your Mom have to teach you how
               because Dad was the same no-chin,
               Connecticut Faggot you are?

     Noonan stops, turns back to me: blazing.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I think I hit the Noonan family
               dynamic, dead-on.

     He winds up an overhand right: a big-bright flash, then           *
     darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn.

     FLUTTERING BLACK:

                           WELLES NOONAN (O.C.)
               Drop him.

                         DERBY #1 (O.C.)
               You don't want to take him in?

                         WELLES NOONAN (O.C.)
               I only want to bring him in when I
               know he'll never leave.

     BLACK dissolves to something LIGHTER, then:


37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - TIME UNKNOWN                       37

     Horizontal. Someone pushed a table and two chairs to one
     side: space for the cot I'm on. Look up. Junior looking
     down: `Concerned' isn't strong enough. In his undershirt. He
     slips the red steno pad into his back pocket. Sit up. A
     balled dress shirt in my hand, blood sopped.

     Gaze at my Hamilton, face cracked, `5:16am'-- Fritz Koenig
     walks in, silver pitcher in hand. I gape up, still punchy.

                                                        54.



                    ME
          Coffee?

                    KOENIG
          Ice. Bradley's on his way down.

Toss the dress shirt to the floor.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          That's mine...you needed some                        *
          mopping up.

                    ME
          Who found me?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          I did. I got there at eleven like
          you said, right as two black &
          white's pulled up: you were out                      *
          cold in a gutter `round the block.                   *
              (this blithe little grin)
          Did Noonan knock you out?

                    ME
          He hit me with his car first.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
              (a nod to Koenig)
          The Captain was the only one here
          at this hour...                                      *

Look from Junior and Koenig to the window behind him --
Bradley steam-rolling our way. To Koenig, conspiratorial:      *

                    KLEIN
          If I need your help later on, can I
          count on it?

                    KOENIG
          Of course you can.

Take the pitcher from him, drop my head, douse myself, the
cold cuts cobwebs. Bradley walks in, imperious. Koenig moves
past -- ice forms between the two.                             *

                    KOENIG (CONT'D)
          Chief.

                    BRADLEY
          What are you doing here?

                    KOENIG
          The Lieutenant was thirsty.

                                                           55.



Koenig closes the door. I refuse to look up at Bradley.

                    BRADLEY
          Progress on Magdalena.

I point to Junior -- happy to play teacher's pet:                *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          No fingerprints. Clean crime scene.
          Canvassed the neighborhood. A
          senile neighbor did report a
          possible Peeper-

-rubbing the back of my head where the Peeper bashed me-

                    ME
          -confirmed Peeper.

Bradley turns to me:

                    BRADLEY
          Is that who knocked you out?

                    ME
          Noonan knocked me out.

                     BRADLEY
              (beat)
          He's having you tailed then...

                    ME
          And he knows the Magdalena name and
          that I was chasing a suspect -- the                    *
          Peeper Lucille strips for.                             *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          She knows someone watches?

                    ME
          And who he is. She has to.
              (back to Bradley)
          I want access to her juvie sheet or                    *
          whatever arrest records exist.                         *
          Rumor was Hector whored her out to                     *
          dealers he did business with.                          *

                    BRADLEY
          That's immaterial.                                     *

                     ME                                          *
              (as my teeth grit)                                 *
          It is if you're eliminating her as                     *
          a suspect-                                             *

                                                        56.



                    BRADLEY                                    *
          -did you confirm their alibi?                        *

Point to the ever-studious Junior.                             *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *
          I spoke with a Mr. and Mrs. Preston                  *
          Mott of Santa Barbara, the parents                   *
          of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and                      *
          they've confirmed their visit and                    *
          also corroborated the argument that                  *
          resulted in them leaving early.                      *

                    BRADLEY                                    *
              (back to me now)                                 *
          One alteration to my previous
          orders-

                    ME                                         *
          -previous orders being what? Assign
          the Cop Noonan blames for his dead
          boxing probe to the case that's
          becoming his new crusade?                            *

Bradley conjures the Roman visage...then slowly opens the      *
door, staring holes in me.                                     *

                    BRADLEY                                    *
          Step out Stemmons.                                   *

Junior balks, looks my way: tries to mimic my sneer. I stand   *
and shove him toward the door. His look back at me: Judas.     *
Bradley closes the door behind him.                            *

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)                           *
          No direct approach on the mother or                  *
          the daughter.                                        *

                    ME
          No. Madge was a battered wife and                    *
          Lucille was a suborned whore. If                     *
          that's not motive, what is? You                      *
          want answers then we brace those                     *
          two hard.

                    BRADLEY                                    *
          If you do so directly, if they're                    *
          formally questioned then Noonan may                  *
          find out and go after them with
          Federal warrants.

                                                    57.



                    ME
          Noonan will figure out who and what
          Hector was sooner or later.                     *

                    BRADLEY                               *
          Yes he will, so we buy time, keep
          him busy-

                    ME
          -until when?

                    BRADLEY
          Until Tom Bethune votes on the
          floor of the city council in two
          days, ratifying the official start
          of construction on Dodger stadium-

                    ME
          -this is bigger than a fucking
          ballpark! Hector Magdalena and
          Narco is the powder-keg, blows the              *
          whole Department to hell.                       *

                    BRADLEY
          Don't be dramatic, it looks weak.
          Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit,
          so I supply him with one-                       *

                    ME
          -me. You want me to draw him off-               *

                    BRADLEY
          -you've been drawing him off. And
          the more he sees you the less he'll
          think of anything other than
          getting you. Now find Tommy and                 *
          take him alive. Do not let Noonan               *
          get to him. As a potential major                *
          case witness against the LAPD,                  *
          Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder-            *
          keg, he's an atom bomb.                         *

Bradley walks. Watch him disappear down the hall.

                    ME (V.O.)
          Bradley has a bigger angle and I'm
          getting close to it...I just
          haven't hit home. Yet.                          *

                                                                58.




38   INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY                                        38

     In a clean T-shirt from my locker. Heading toward Junior's
     desk. All eyes on my wounds. I toss Stemmons his shirt.

                         ME
               Seltzer will take the blood out.

     Junior bitchy, like some broad you stood up:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               I give you the shirt off my back                        *
               and you bash me!                                        *

                         ME
               When a Superior Officer tells you
               to leave the room, you leave the                        *
               fucking room.                                           *

     Junior balls the shirt, stuffs it in his desk drawer. Takes a     *
     deep breath.                                                      *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               I made a file on the Bledsoe broad.
               The one you asked about.

                         ME
               Thanks. But forget it.

                          JUNIOR STEMMONS
               I spent a whole day putting it
               together and this skirt's got
               skeletons.

     Reminded, glance at my hand: "A I N G E" in smeared ink.
     Junior rips open a file, blathers Bledsoe preliminaries:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
               Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17.
               Prostitution arrest at 21. Known
               associate of a Kern County homicide
               victim, this convicted pimp named
               Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp.
               Stabbed to death in his home,
               weapon never recovered-

                         ME
               Forget it. Burn it, s'not important
               now.

     Take the file from him, flip through; thorough, detailed.
     Glenda priors scream back instant conviction.

                                                               59.



                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Why is it not important?

     Plant the file in his chest as my answer.

                         ME
               I need an address on a guy named
               Ainge, George Ainge-                                    *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               -what about Magdalena?

     My temper turning threadbare.

                         ME
               -after you get the Ainge address,                       *
               get back to the Magda-

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
                   (picks up Glenda's file)
               -is Ainge related to this Cunt?

     Snap-grit-grab him: buttons from his shirt pop, bounce.

                         ME
               We're partners in name only. You
               want to stay in the room next time,
               Junior? Do something to impress me:
               like finding that address.

     Dig Junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad-dog
     glare: makes me want to break the bones in his face.


39   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                               39

     Driving, running parallels to avoid Fed tails. No Black
     Buicks...But a Gray Packard shifts behind me on a cadence.        *

                         ME (V.O.)
               Noonan replaced the Buick with a                        *
               Packard and a better Shadow-Man.                        *
               But I could still spot the tail.                        *

     Run a red light at Rossmore, leave the Packard behind.            *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               This jet-engine urge to see her.
               Needing it like a junkie does. No
               logic. Just the push.

                                                          60.



Driving past Glenda's house now. No Corvette. Driving past      *
the Griffith Park `Vampires' set: addicts/crew rolling up
sleeping bags. No Corvette. Pull the address list Dandy
handed me: Talent Domiciles.

Pasadena. Howard's Fuck-Pad supreme: A tudor mansion with
airplane-shaped hedges. A Corvette in the drive. Stop at the
curb. Open shades. Flashes of her. Gathering something. Check
my Hamilton, look up as: KNOCK-KNOCK on my window. Her face,
inches-close. Bags of groceries in her hands and this wry
little smile: watch me kill Hughes's new Dick with kindness.    *

Roll the window down, stay blank-slate. She features my
cuts/bruises. Her quiet, deep voice is like medicine:

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Better looking than the last guy
          Howard hired. Once you heal.
              (she recognizes me)
          Wait a minute. You were there, the
          other night, the Bethune Party...                     *

My heart jammed up into my throat. Push past it.                *

                       ME
          Yeah.                                                 *

                    GLENDA
          Mickey told me this `Bent Cop'
          everybody used to call-
              (mocking, I love it:)
          -`The Enforcer' was asking about
          me. Told me to be careful. So
          you're LAPD after all...

                       ME
          In theory.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          You're going to arrest me for
          breaking and entering?

                    ME
          Depends.
              (nod to groceries)
          Those Howard's?

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Everything's Howard's.

                    ME
          Except you.

                                                        61.



                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          That's why I left.

                    ME
          You just shop here now?

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Some of our extras haven't had a
          vegetable since Truman.

                    ME
          Attack of the Atomic Vampires...

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
              (smiles, no flinch)
          We can't all be Audrey Hepburn.
          Plus it pays bills.

                    ME
          Better than a billionaire does?
          Go make amends and finish out your
          service contract Ms. Bledsoe.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Not if there was just one day left
          on it.

                    ME
          Why?

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          I'm better than that.

                    ME
          You're also better than a starring
          role in schlock horror flick
          that'll never see a screen,
          regardless if it's leading lady
          gets `kidnapped' or not.                              *

Drop that coffee cup from the other night into her bag. She's
beat, but bluffs by.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          This isn't the first time you've
          spied on me.

                    ME
          Nor the second.

                                                             62.



                          GLENDA BLEDSOE
                   (beat)
               Well you've got me all giftwrapped,
               Enforcer-

                         ME
               -Dave. You're on Hughes' bad side
               Ms. Bledsoe. It's not a bright
               place to be. So please go-

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               -Glenda.
                   (this smile just for me)
               And tell Howard I'll take my
               chances with the fake vampires.

               Message from a Lester Lake: asked
               that you contact him immediately.

     Ignition. Gas. Tires catch smoke as I peel away.


40   EXT. PASADENA PAYPHONE - DAY                                 40

     Out of dimes, drop slugs instead. Three rings, somebody snags
     it before the fourth. Background reverb blares, bar racket.
     Hear a muted male growl `Club Alabam...'

                         ME
               Get me Lester. This is Lieutenant
               Klein, LAPD-

     -click. Fuck. Fish for another slug. Redial. One ring. Picked
     up, same background din-

               phone or I'll have your liquor
               license and after-hours permits
               yanked inside the hour...

     A muffled back and forth before Lester comes on the line:

            I think she's been truckin' with

            Dunno, but when he'd get drunk,                   *
            he'd trade Horse for blowjobs out                 *

            Called a friend of hers, a waitress
            that works here too, said she was                 *
            at Bido Lito's in Hollywood. Said                 *
            she was `hiding out.'

            She actually said `hiding out?'                   *

                      LESTER LAKE
            Then she got off the phone. Fast.
            If Tilly's running with that demon,               *
            you gotta get her out of there. She               *
            got a lot more good in her than not-              *

     Driving.

                          ME (V.O.)
                Smart Tommy. Dodging Darktown
                altogether. Holed up in Hollywood.
                Hiding in plain sight.


42   INT. DINER - DAY                                          42

     Back booth with a view of the street. Bido Lito's across the
     way. Eyeball the entrance and adjoining alley. On the table
     in front of me, mugshots: known Tommy Magdalena associates.     *
     Mostly greaser kids with low-rent juvie sheets.                 *

     Stare at that photo of Tommy.

                          ME (V.O.)
                Stakeout work. Browse mugs. Match a
                face out front if I get lucky. Wait
                till Bido Lito's gets busy before I
                make my move.


43   INT. DINER - NIGHT (LATER)                                43

     Snub my last Chesterfield, stifle a yawn, check my Hamilton.
     9:20 PM. Bito Crowd bops out front. Valet ballet.               *
     Scanning...spot a face...pull my mugshots...Steve Wenzel,       *
     Okie white-trash from El Monte, shoving his way through the
     crush out in front of the club, hits the side alley.

     I'm up. Dump a pocketful of coins on the table. Hit the door.


44   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                  44

     Cross fast, play the wall and the shadows close. Watch as
     Wenzel climbs steps to a flop overtop of the club. Get deeper
     into the alley: a padlocked two-car overhang at the rear.
     Grip my .45, stock down, swing, split the lock. Chain spools
     at my feet, slide inside the overhang...a car concealed under
     a tarpaulin, peel it off slow...revealing a red `32 Ford.       *

                          ME (V.O.)                                  *

               Now he's on foot.                                       *


45   INT. SECOND FLOOR FLOP - CONTINUOUS                          45

     Jimmy the door,   slide inside silent. Muffled sounds through
     the floor, some   jazz combo wailing away at Bido Lito's below.
     Voices down the   hall, male, laughter, goofball guffaws.
     George Gobel on   the tube: `Well, I'll be a dirty bird!

     Creep in a crouch, my .45 at the hip, safety off. Move toward
     the flicker at the far end of the hall. Sounds of pissing         *
     nearby, ease around a doorjamb .45 first: bedroom barren,
     dust-caked mattress, a half dozen bottles of Old Crow lie
     scattered among sash cords & used heroin spikes.

     Light from the bathroom...a pair of legs visible, female.
     Dark but pale, splayed from inside the bathroom...the right
     foot slowly moves back and forth like the heel is trying to
     gain some purchase on fast-draining life. Somebody flushes,
     zips up, steps over the two legs.

     Duck back into the hall as this Greaser stinking of pomade
     wafts past, weaving back toward the TV room.


46   INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                    46

     Inside. Move fast now. A fist-sized lump swells mid-chest,
     blossoms into my throat. I don't want to see what I know is
     there. Turn the corner:

     Club Alabam songbird Tilly Hopwell. Three breaths from death.
     A spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm. Her
     right hand claws at tile. These beautiful dark eyes stare up
     at me like she was hoping for someone sooner. Throttle marks
     on her neck, one breast exposed, bra pulled down for a grope.

     I don't want to touch her face but I do...she closes her eyes
     the moment my fingertips hit. That gases my hate. Choke back
     sudden tears.

                         VOICE BEHIND ME
               FUCK YOU DOIN'?

     Turn back. GREASER in the doorway, brown-bagged T-Bird hits
     the floor as he reaches for his waist -- stand and shoot him
     in the throat. Drive the .45 into his sternum like a blade
     before I fire the second-third-fourth shots. He falls/flails.     *
     Jump-shock from the other room.                                   *

                                                                66.



                         ME                                            *
               POLICE!                                                 *

     Bodies scramble. No words. Just Pistol fire through the half-     *
     rotted walls -- punks taking potshots. No compliance means I      *
     hit the hallway shooting back. Firing dead-bang at a couple       *
     fleeing silhouettes -- see them pop-stumble-fall-                 *

     -the archway above my head shreds, collapses. Somebody firing
     a sub-machine gun. Flat on my ass, my back finds the wall,        *
     cough up plaster, sleeve my eyes to see. Then quiet, save the     *
     rattle-clap of changing clips.                                    *

                         ME                                            *
               PUT THAT GOD DAMN GUN DOW-                              *

                         TOMMY MAGDALENA (O.C.)
               -YOU SET ME UP YOU COCKSUCKER!

     Machine-gun fire lights up my left side. Roll. Taste floor        *
     grime as subsonic zips snap close...bullets miss by inches.       *

                         TOMMY MAGDALENA
               -RAT FUCK COP! YOU KILLED HIM                           *
               WILHITE!

     Every part of me pauses...`Wilhite'...back door gets blunted
     open, frantic footfalls recede. That big bent V-8 on Tommy's
     `32 Deuce roars to life. Up now, plow through the cloud of
     cordite. See one of Tommy's Pachucos propped up against the       *
     wall, unhit, unhurt. Point my .45 and pull the trigger a I        *
     pass. Hit an empty chamber...this punk's lucky day.


47   EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS                                      47

     Out the door reloading as the `32 Deuce barrels away. Tommy
     fires shots into the air to clear traffic. Wenzel in the          *
     passenger seat, screams to do the same. The Driver's side rim     *
     sparks fireworks.                                                 *

     Pandemonium out in front of Bido Lito's as the crowd
     stampedes ass-over-elbows. Sprint to my car, inside, key          *
     dispatch fast as I wheel rough off the curb:                      *

                         ME
               Shots fired, 1600 block of Ivar.                        *
               Suspect fleeing scene in red `32                        *

     -horns blare as I slalom club-goers scrambling across Ivar.
     Punch it over-top Sunset, parallel to the Deuce. Rip a left       *
     on Selma. Stay on my radio:

                         ME
               -and I need an ambulance to respond
               to 1607 North Ivar, second floor,
               female negro, possible overdose.

     Up ahead I catch a fireworks show: the Deuce gouges pavement      *
     across the 4-way. Clip 90 MPH catching up. Squeal onto Wilcox     *
     as Tommy hooks a right onto Hollywood.                            *

     Two prowlers pass the next second, sirens lit, full scream.       *


48   EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND VINE - CONTINUOUS                         48

     Haul ass up to Hollywood, round it: See Tommy and Wenzel
     sitting upright, the Deuce spun sidelong, firing M3 `Grease
     Guns' into the approaching prowlers. Both cars go helter-
     skelter under fire. Six-packs spill to the street, belly          *
     crawl, brandish .38 service snubs and pop flimsy return fire.

     Tommy jumps down, runs, rifling his jacket for clips. Wenzel
     stays atop the car -- gun my engine, split the abandoned          *
     prowlers. Wenzel looks up mid-reload as I T-bone the `Deuce'      *
     at speed. The impact rockets him rag-doll end over end before     *
     he bombs back down to the street, wet sack, multiple
     bruises/fractures/breaks...blood pooling in pints.

     Tommy wide-eyes the heap that was Wenzel. Kick my driver's        *
     side door open firing. Tommy cuts loose with that Grease-Gun,     *
     sprays wild. Crouch-move as bullets thump wreckage and whiz
     by overhead. More sirens approach. Tuck behind the front end
     of the mangled `Deuce.'

     Another salvo from the Grease-Gun skips up off the pavement       *
     in front of me. The six-packs have regrouped, start laying        *
     down fire on Tommy. Tommy running now -- I'm up on one knee,      *
     aiming, tucking into the .45: take his legs but don't kill h-     *

     -that Gray Packard materializes across the intersection in
     front of Tommy: shotgun blasts from the driver's side             *
     backseat obliterates Tommy's mid-section.                         *

     My mouth gapes at what just happened...then I remember to         *
     fire at the Packard as it continues down the street, running      *
     lights extinguished, no plates visible.

     Get to Tommy. Crying. Fading. Roll him on his back.               *

                                                             68.

               Where's your father!? Did Wilhite                     *
               kill him!?- TELL ME!

     -bubbling blood in place of words. Mouth moves like a           *
     grouper's...get close...his last gasp...pray it's profound.     *
     He breathes out...nothing.                                      *


49   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NIGHT                              49    *

               Bido Lito's too fast to catch a                       *
               tail. So where did they come from?                    *


50   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - DAY                            50

     Magdalena home. Pull up onto the front lawn. Grab my brass      *
     knucks from the glove box. Out of my car. Growling. A pair of   *
     Narco brims, Wilhite's boys, break wide on my approach.         *
     Junior stumbles from the stakeout car, rushing up the street
     toward me.

51   INT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - CONTINUOUS                     51    *

     Inside. Madge, this vacant glaze, tear-smudged, mock mourning   *
     with more booze and pills...word of Tommy's demise has          *
     reached her.                                                    *

     Wilhite and Lucille in the middle of some close conversation.

Grab Lucille's bruised arms. Wilhite grabs me in return. Hear   *

Wilhite tries to push past. Gut-punch him hard, trying to     *
rupture something. Shove him back into the wall. Drywall
implodes. He squeals/shrieks, seizes his shoulder.            *

          Am I? Where's Hector? You can't
          file murder charges without a

          What investigation? Tommy's murder?                    *
          Hector's disappearance? What are                       *

          You're on one month's unpaid leave                     *
          as of this moment.                                     *

Go right at him, cut his steam.                                  *

               You're scamming something big.                       *

     See red. Launch. Try to wrap my hands around his throat.       *
     Watch him feather back just out of reach. Junior and a pair    *
     of six-packs restrain me.                                      *

               What's your fucking angle Bradley!?                  *

     His eyes beam back doom.                                       *

54   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - CONTINUOUS                         54   *

     Reach the car, slide in, anger in aftershocks rattle across    *
     still balled fists. Junior at my window blathering white       *
     noise. He might as well be speaking Greek.                     *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *

               some things together-                                *

     Rip my radio, punch the call button.

                         KLEIN
               Central, this is Klein, I need an
               update on that overdose I called
               in. What's the girl's condition?

     Static. Wait. Anger make my eyes ache, fuzz my focus.

                         DISPATCH
               Lieutenant Klein, the girl, Tilda
               Hopwell was pronounced D.O.A. at
               Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital-

     Rage flares, slam the radio into the dash console, crushing
     it- fists flex, blood seeps from a battered knuckle, look at   *
     my hands: blood drool over the faint remains of the pen-       *
     scrawled `A I N G E'...Glare up at Junior:                     *

                                                             75.

55   EXT. ROW HOUSE - CULVER CITY - NIGHT                         55   *

     Up the walk, Junior tailing, feel his stare.                      *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS                               *
               You're in no state to conduct
               yourself as a Police Offic-

                         ME                                            *

               don't badge him, don't talk.                            *

     BLACK. Then a light turns on somewhere: my gun in a round         *
     man's face just through his front door. GEORGE AINGE.             *


56   INT. GEORGE AINGE'S PAD - NIGHT                              56   *

     Tough Ainge: He doesn't flinch. Drops his lunch-pail slow.        *
     Takes off his jacket: jail-house tattoos abound. He sits.         *

                         ME                                            *
               How do you know Glenda Bledsoe?                         *

     Junior's `betrayed' look: this guy is tied to that Cooze.         *

                         GEORGE AINGE                                  *
               Knew that whore'd try to muscle me-                     *

                         ME                                            *
               -don't call her a whore again.                          *

     Laughs in my face:                                                *

                         GEORGE AINGE                                  *
               If you gave her as many paychecks                       *
               as me, you'd know `whore' fits                          *
               like a fuckin glov-                                     *

     -I grab a chair cushion, put the .45 against it, fire a           *
     muffled round that blows Ainge's hair back as it passes.          *
     Junior twitches hard enough to spot himself. Ainge jabbers:       *

                         GEORGE AINGE (CONT'D)                         *
               She fucked for a fee! Jesus Christ                      *
               she's a pro! What is she paying to                      *
               get that blade back-                                    *

                                                           76.



-get the gun in his face, burn his nose with the barrel.         *

                    ME                                           *
          What? What `blade?'                                    *

                     GEORGE AINGE                                *
          What's she paying you to recover                       *
          her knife?

Just then Junior banana peels it -- deliberately:                *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *
          Lieutenant!                                            *

A hate-scowl for Junior: trying to put enough heat behind it     *
to melt his head. Ainge lights up.                               *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *
          Y'all are Cops!?                                       *

                    ME                                           *
          Shut your mouth.                                       *

Ainge sees me bent on Glenda. Looks past me, past the gun in     *
his face, aims right at Junior.                                  *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *
          Back in `50, Glenda the Good Witch                     *
          put a blade in her pimp `bout as                       *
          deep as I put my pink in her, this                     *
          mongrel named Dwight Gillette.                         *

Junior fixes me, pulls that steno, starts scribbling openly -- *
I grab it, shred it. Ainge grins at the voodoo between us.     *

                    GEORGE AINGE (CONT'D)                        *
          Could use a couple LAPD favors, and                    *
          ain't guttin' a pimp still a crime?                    *

          Guess who she asked to hold the                        *
          knife? Guess why she brought me in                     *
          on this kidnap thing? It was her                       *

          -show it to me.                                        *

          I'll have my lawyer take a picture                     *
          of it for you-                                         *

-throw his TV at his head: legitimately trying to kill him       *
now and he knows it. Off his chair, crawling.                    *

                     JUNIOR STEMMONS                             *
          STOP!                                                  *
              (more question than                                *
                statement)                                       *
          YOU ARE NOT BENT ON AN EX-WHORE!                       *

I grab the shattered tube: throw it again. Big POP inches        *
from Ainge. Angry at myself for missing twice:                   *

                    ME                                           *
          GOD DAMN IT-                                           *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *
          -HE'S A MATERIAL WITNESS TO A MURD-                    *

-grab Junior, sharp jab him, push him out a door for the         *
second time-                                                     *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                     *
          -YOU WILL CEASE AND DESIST KLEIN-                      *

-final push with my foot gives me enough room to dead-bolt it    *
behind him. Ainge can't fit under his bed.                       *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *
          I AIN'T RESISTING YOU!                                 *

                    ME                                           *
          I'm not arresting you.                                 *

Flip the mattress. Teen Tit mags and jack-off socks fly with     *
it. Ainge under pine slats. Panic. I put my foot through,        *
bash his gut -- rip him out from underneath.                     *

                    ME (CONT'D)                                  *
              (hissing)                                          *
          Where is it?                                           *

Ainge unable to speak, gasping for air. Step to his closet:      *
shred hinges when I open it. Rip the clothes rod down:           *
nothing. Pull shelves from the wall: a Louisville Slugger        *
falls at my feet. I smile. Ainge goes frightwig. Step to him.    *

                    ME (CONT'D)                                  *
          WHERE?!                                                *

     Swing it into a wall. Gaping holes in holster. Bring it back
     like Babe Ruth over his head.

                         ME (CONT'D)                                  *
               -that blade or your life.                              *

     Door bashed open behind me -- deadbolt assembly pops, pieces     *
     hit me -- then something big/black-metallic ends my night:       *
     Junior, tear-streaked cheeks, Ainge's mailbox in-hand, pulled    *
     free from the stucco. I drop. Ainge turns cheerleader:           *

               NICE!                                                  *

     Roll to my knees: guttural groans I can't place   because        *
     they're mine. Junior rips a radio cord from the   wall, wraps    *
     it around my neck, pulls my head back, feel his   tears hit my   *
     shoulders. Veins in his arms go Pop. Eyes in my   head go Pop.   *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *
               Last time you push me out a door!                      *
               For a dirty split-tail! You're-                        *
                   (cinches hard)
               -not dragging me down! If Bradley
               doesn't get you, Noonan will! And-

     Driving. Glenda close. I want to pull her closer. We wind         *
     along Topanga Canyon. Constant mirror checks, looking for         *
     Packards/Buicks/Ghosts...seeing nothing...I roll my window        *
     up. Light jazz on the radio gives way to the news:                *

     -click it off. Abrupt. She notices, says nothing. After
     another half mile she points to a side road: 655 TOPANGA CYN      *
     RD on the mailbox. I pull in. A gravel drive gives way to a       *
     bungalow, tucked into the trees.                                  *

                                                                85.

63   INT. MY CAR - NIGHT                                          63

     Driving. Blood-shot. Slowly being squeezed on all sides.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Looking for leverage. Figure out
               Bradley's angle before I fry.
               Madge and Lucille in custody. No
               Hector and no Tommy equals No
               leads. Save one.

                                                             86.




64   EXT. SANTA MONICA HOTEL - EARLY A.M.                      64    *

     Slouched in my front seat, watching a small flop-style motel    *
     near the beach.

                          ME (V.O.)
               Dan Wilhite.
                   (beat)
               Dispatch shot me his temporary
               address. Some beach flop he fled to
               after his wife put him out.

     Check my Hamilton: 7:32 AM. A car pulls into the parking lot.
     Two suits step out, ramrod straight, starched officious:
     Process Servers if ever I've seen them. One of them bears a
     sealed envelope as they walk to room #11 and knock. No
     answer. They knock rude. I roll down my window.

     Dan Wilhite answers in a robe: Groggy-pissed-hungover. Before
     he utters a word, he's handed the sealed envelope and the
     pair depart. Wilhite calls after, tearing open the envelope
     and reading what's inside...then rereading it.

     Gauge his reaction: ruined.

     He puts his hand on top of his head...like he's trying to
     protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him.
     Another big pause staring at nothing...then he just calmly
     walks back inside the room, closing the door behind him.


65   EXT. SANTA MONICA HOTEL - NEXT MOMENT                     65

     Out of my car. Quietly hustling up to Wilhite's door: Reach
     it and hear a distinct POP -- see the flash-snap from behind
     the curtains: Gunshot. I know what it is. Hit the door.


66   INT. WILHITE'S ROOM - NEXT MOMENT                         66

     Wilhite's service revolver a foot away from one hand, a sheet
     of paper still gripped in the other. Body half onto the bed,
     half off. Blood drains from a round wound in his temple.

     Check behind me, nobody coming- close the hotel door. Pick up
     the sheet of paper/contents of the envelope. The first word I
     see: SUBPOENA.

                         ME (V.O.)
               My first thought, pure panic:
               Noonan figured the Narco-Magalena
               connection.

                                                              87.



     Flip the Subpoena over to see his Signature: not Noonan's.
     This subpoena has been issued and signed by LA District
     Attorney Bob Gallaudet. Flip it back over, wide-eyed:

                          ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               But it wasn't a Federal Subpoena.
               Wilhite was being called to testify
               by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn't
               piss without Bradley's say-so.
                   (beat)
               Bradley trying to beat Noonan to
               the punch and burn the LAPD
               himself...why?


67   EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER                                      67

     A quick check of the lot. Empty. A housekeeping cart sits
     nearby. Swipe a bottle of bleach from it. Walk to Wilhite's
     Studebaker Powerhawk. Pop the trunk, return to his room.

     Move quick. Fireman's carry, dump Wilhite's body in the
     trunk. Toss his service .38 too. Pour the bottle of bleach to
     stanch the inevitable rot smell.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Swap my car for Wilhite's. The
               former head of the LAPD's Narcotics
               division dead in the trunk. Call it
               the leverage I was looking for --
               his body can buy me out of bad spot-

     -and that's when I see it: a bandage poking out from under         *
     Wilhite's collar...undo a couple buttons, lift the bandage.        *

                                                      FLASH TO:


68   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - NIGHT                              68   *

     BAM: me hit from behind by the Peeper. BAM: me firing at the       *
     Peeper. Hit him in the left shoulder. BAM: Grabbing Wilhite's      *
     shoulder in the Magdalena bathroom, him howling in pain.           *

                                                      RETURN TO:        *


69   INT. WILHITE'S GARAGE - NEXT MOMENT                           69   *

     The kind of wound a grazed bullet leaves.                          *

                                                              88.



                         ME (V.O.)                                    *
               Wilhite was the Peeper. Bent on                        *
               Lucille, a girl younger than his                       *
               youngest daughter. Call it grounds
               for divorce...Call Wilhite Hector
               Magdalena's murderer...

     Slam the trunk as Wilhite's glazed eyes stare back at me.


70   EXT. STREET - A.M.                                          70   *

     Slow cruise, new ride means no tails. Check my mirrors           *
     anyway. Back to the pad, back-streets all the way.               *


71   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - A.M.                        71   *

     Rounding the corner -- break hard: those same process servers
     leaning on my doorbell now.

                         ME
               Bradley trying to bury me too. That
               subpoena means my fifteen year
               career with the LAPD just went up
               in smoke.

     Continue past. Those Process Geeks keep buzzing my doorbell.


72   INT. BREAKFAST JOINT PAY-PHONE - MORNING                    72

     Drop dimes. Dial Pete.

                          ME
               Hey-

                         PETE (O.S.)
               -Junior's left the fucking planet.

                         ME
               You find him?

                         PETE
               Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car
               was out front. I scoped it: a sawed-
               off shotgun in front, canned tuna
               in the back seat. Think he's living
               outta that car. After he left, I
               tried to get inside his place: The
               front door is triple pad-locked.

                                                             89.



                         ME
                   (out loud)
               That knife is in there-

                            PETE
               -the what?

     Shit. Ignore it, maybe Pete will too.

                         ME
               Meet me down the street from his
               place. You got bolt cutters?

                         PETE
               I'll bring `em.

                         ME
               Thirty minutes.


73   EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY                              73

     Junior's stucco-beige apartment building looms a block up.
     Cursory checks of the rear and side-view mirrors. Sans tail
     as I pull the Powerhawk in behind Pete's Caddy. Step out,
     sidle up driver's side.

                         PETE
               Who's car is that?

                         ME
               Long story.

                         PETE
               Junior looked real skeezed this
               morning. Like he was on a dope jag.

                            ME
               Yeah?

                         PETE
               Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be
               careful. He was fucking around with
               his front door before he left. I
               don't know what he was doing.

                         ME
               Two honks if he shows. Then meet me
               in the alley, back of his place.

                                                             90.



                         PETE
                   (handing me bolt-cutters)
               What about this Bledsoe broad?
               Milteer has called me twice.

                         ME
                   (taking the bolt-cutters)
               One thing at a time pal.


74   EXT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                    74

     Hustle across the street. Hang my badge over my shirt-pocket.


75   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          75

     Up three flights. Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver
     hardware extending between door and jamb. Three kicks and a
     shoulder to splinter the door. Stop, look: Some kind of twine
     stretched taut, just inside the door...trip-wire. Pull my pig-
     sticker, extend it between door and jamb...see the twine
     stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it.

     Stand. Put my boot into the door full. Snaps at the hinges.


76   INT. APT. 303 - NEXT MOMENT                               76

     Move slow. Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry-
     rigged around the door. Severed twine attached to the trigger
     of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level.

     Continue to look around. Sex-horror grimace: like catching
     Pop fingering Mom. Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Junior the Insane: You couldn't
               hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA,
               and not have it rot your mind.

     Bear traps barely hidden under sheets. Rat-traps garnished
     with razor blades across the floor. Smell rotten flowers: his
     shirt that I wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed
     jizz stains cover black blood stains. Stifle a gag.

     Card table: an empty green-banded evidence bag. Gape at it.
     Then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 South Tremaine.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Junior stealing evidence from the
               Magdalena crime scene.

                                                                      91.



Then I see the bookcase. Top shelf: Police manuals. Bottom
two shelves: wall-to-wall red steno-pads, all exactly the
same brand. Shock. Step over. Flip through them: tiny,
architect-neat script covers every page. The running dialogue
of a functional fucking freak:

MAGDALENA RESIDENCE. 1284 S. TREMAINE. RECOVERED: MAGDALENA FINANCIAL
RECORDS/LEDGERS. SOME ENTRIES REDACTED. TRANSLATED `HH' INTO
`HURWITZ HOLDINGS' AFTER RECOVERING MAIL. SEEMS SUSPICIOUS. BROUGHT
TO ATTENTION OF KLEIN. BRUSHED OFF. PRESS IN SPITE OF KLEIN'S LAZINESS OR
LACK OF INTEREST.

A hand drawn cock doodled beneath that, then below:

DAVE WEARING FORM-FITTING SHIRT TODAY. HANDSOME. I WANT TO PULL IT-

-drop the steno like it might bite. Pick up another: same
drill.

WELLES NOONAN WILL WIN OUT. KLEIN NOT SKILLED OR SMART ENOUGH TO
DUEL WITH A U.S. ATTORNEY MUCH LESS THE FBI. DEEP ADMIRATION FOR
NOONAN'S CAUSE. HIS PURPOSE IS PURE. DON'T WANT TO GET DRAGGED DOWN
WITH POISON PILL KLEIN. MAKE HIM PAY FOR PATRONIZING ME.

Pick up yet another, hands shaking, turn to the last page:

MAKE KLEIN HURT LIKE I HURT. TRADE HIM. TRADE EVERYTHING. TRADE UP TO
THE BUREAU. THINK OF IT: AGENT RICHARD STEMMONS JR. PROUD-PROUD. 1
DREAM DOWN, 10,000 TO GO!

                      ME (V.O.)
            Junior the Climber, trading me up
            to Noonan. Thinks bootlicking will
            buy him a Bureau gig.

Now, rifle for that knife. Systemically destroy the place.
Dump the stenos in a trash can, sift for matches, strike,
watch the pads catch and floosh, feed the fire with random
paperwork, sift -- Junior's cock-obsessed doodles scribbled
by the dozen.

Under the bed now, carpet covered in rat-traps. Spring them,
clear a space. A Box: beefcake booty, gay smut mags, gay
classified ads. First-person perspective Polaroids of
Junior's stomach being kissed by the Diskant Quiff and vice-
versa.

Open a massive steamer trunk against a far wall. Arsenal:
handguns, shotguns, a surplus M-1. Dump it, kick contents.
Only interested in that knife.

                                                             92.



     Move into his kitchenette. Check the freezer even though
     Junior is smarter than that: amyl-nitrate poppers, vodka,
     benzedrine, cocaine. Close it. Look down. STOP: indents in
     the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit.

     Pull to see what's behind. Eyes catch the bear-trap near the
     bed as I tug: ugly-rusted-waiting. STOP part II: Contort,
     peer behind the refrigerator: a pineapple-shaped hand grenade
     duct-taped to the wall, next to a built-in safe.

                         MY NARRATOR VOICE (V.O.)
               The safe scared me more than all of
               it because a safe doesn't get
               installed overnight...he'd been
               working on something, planning
               something...

     Twine leads from the grenade's pin to the back of the
     refrigerator. My bolt-cutters snap it. Pull the refrigerator
     out now. The safe bolted into the drywall. Stare at it: the
     dial, the black paint-job...

                                                       CUT TO:

     Loading shells into the shotgun that was atop that jello
     mold. Back into the kitchen. Exhale. BEGIN BLASTING. Massive
     noise. Six shots. Reload fast: nothing can muffle this
     clatter. SECOND VOLLEY. Eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall
     out. Gagging on gunsmoke. Rip at the safe -- something gives.
     THIRD VOLLEY. The Safe hits the floor, leaves a hole.

     Through the ringing in my ears: something that sounds like
     honks. Quick peek: Pete gone. A Black Buick with two white-
     walled FEDS up front. Then Junior gets out of the backseat...

     Scoop the freezer drugs, the stack of man-porn, the
     snapshots, and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front
     of Junior's door. Grab the green-banded evidence bag and tuck
     it under my arm. Back into the kitchenette. Turn on the gas
     but don't light the burners. Pull the grenade off the wall.
     Drag the safe to the rear of his place: the fire escape.


77   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NEXT MOMENT                              77

     Out the window, on the escape, toss the evidence-bag down to
     Pete, then push the safe over the railing. Feature it almost
     crush the back of Pete's idling Cadillac. Pete jumps, yells:

                          PETE
               Asshole!

                                                             93.



                         ME
               Get it open if you can and meet me
               back at Meg's!

     Doesn't move until I pull the pin on the pineapple, drop the
     pin down on him. He jumps back in, peels off-


78   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NEXT MOMENT               78

     -Junior on the second-floor landing, heading to his place.
     Bloodshot bleary wide eyes, spun on a combo of drugs, the
     Feds herding him like a rabid dog:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Stay right here. I'll get it all
               and come back. Don't move.


79   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - SAME MOMENT                               79

     Ricochet the grenade back into the kitchen. Leap down half a
     flight: put exterior brick between my head and the-

     -BIG BOOM -- the grenade goes off.


80   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME MOMENT               80

     Junior knocked on his ass halfway up the last flight. Feds
     come sprinting. Screaming Junior tackles one on the way up.
     Juniors' front-door blown off. Terrified Neighbors greeted
     with images of Sodom scattered from the explosion: drugs,
     mags, dildos. The Fed that didn't get tackled picks up a
     photo: Junior kissing a hairy stomach.

     And Junior's mind snaps cleanly in-half. Crawls away growling
     like a bear caught in one of his traps.


81   EXT. ALLEY - NEXT MOMENT                                     81

     I step calm. Clear the alley slow. Don't let your stride give
     you away. Another Black Buick arrives. More Bureau stiffs.
     Keep moving. Looky-Loos pop up along the block, pointing. I'm
     the only one not looking back toward Junior's now flaming
     pad. The Powerhawk still another street up. Fire engines wail
     close.

     Shouts from behind now. Look back: a Bureau putz pointing my
     way -- one of the Buicks tearing up the block toward me.

                                                             94.



                         ME (V.O.)
               Call it. Keep going and give up
               Wilhite's car and the corpse
               inside, or lay back and deal with
               Noonan's Buzzcuts.

     Lace my fingers behind my head, turn to face them -- catch a
     form tackle from this geeked up junior G-Man diving from the
     Buick, drives his shoulder and takes me down sprawling.


82   INT. L.A. FEDERAL BUILDING - LATER                        82

     Welles Noonan staring. He picks nipped/mutilated fingernails.

                          ME (CONT'D)
               Civil servants can't afford
               manicures?

                         WELLES NOONAN
               Breaking and entering, theft, and
               willful destruction of private
               property...and I'll add attempted
               murder to the current first degree
               murder charge I'm about to file
               against you.

                         ME
               Proof. If you had it, you wouldn't
               be fucking around with shitty
               shakedown routine -- you'd file.
               Coercion equals confession. So
               let's see you pound it out of me.

                         WELLES NOONAN
               Where are the files you stole from
               Sergeant Richard Stemmons.

                         ME
               Junior. Your secret weapon right? I
               mean, I know J. Edgar is a slanted
               fuck, but traditionally `vicious
               fags' don't make the best major
               case witnesses.
                   (beat, keep pushing)
               I'm worried those burning dildos
               may have damaged his credibility.

                         WELLES NOONAN
               Oh I don't need his testimony
               Klein. I'll just force yours.

                                       95.



          ME
Not if you had the next hundred
years.

          WELLES NOONAN
Sanderline Johnson, your links to
Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen,
extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire.
I'll put you in every pair of cross-
hairs I can find. I'll torch
everything you've ever touched. You
have no idea how deep I run Klein.
And how far I'm willing to go to
fuck you-

          ME
-everyone knows I'm a piece-a-shit.
What are you proving? Bradley's the
guy flanking you right now. The guy
who's vulnerable right now.

          WELLES NOONAN
You're all angles and graft Klein.
Why trust a God damn word that
comes out of your-

          ME
-you done anything with the
Magdalena case?

          WELLES NOONAN
    (thrown)
Prelims: drug pusher gone missing,
presumed dead, we're investigat-

          ME
    (scoffing)
-Dealing drugs for 20 years!
Arrested once. Hall a' fame career!
You photographed the head of Narco
in-front of his house...

          WELLES NOONAN
AND?

          ME
Jesus Christ, you need cue cards?
    (sell this fucker now)
Come after me: you get me. Go after
what I can give you and you get the
LAPD's power-set on a slab.

                                                          96.



                    WELLES NOONAN
          I don't believe you'd turn.
          Treacherous yes, traitorous no.
          Tell me where Stemmons' files are.

                    ME
          I'll bring them to you.

                    WELLES NOONAN
          You're not leaving here Klein.

                    ME
          Then like I said: you only get me.

Noonan stands, firm:

                    WELLES NOONAN
          I'll take it.

On his way out I speak fast -- the last ace in my deck:

                    ME
          I give you the body of Dan Wilhite,
          head of LAPD's Narcotics Division.
          Proof of a 20-year criminal
          collusion between his department
          and Hector Magdalena and my
          testimony to link the dots.
              (beat, make him believe)
          Then I leave LA for good.

Noonan at the door: please bite-please bite...but he just
smirks, walks out. Real panic now: no ideas on what comes
next. 15 seconds. Door opens again: one of Noonan's deputies
pushes a sheet. Scan it: Federal Witness Agreement. Noonan
back: two cups of coffee. Read it over.

                    WELLES NOONAN
          What happened to Wilhite?

                       ME
          Suicide.

                    WELLES NOONAN
          Like Sanderline Johnson?

Ignore him. Sign the agreement.

                    WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D)
          Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite's
          body by noon tomorrow.

Gulp the coffee back, the burn feels good.

                                                             97.



                         ME
               No more tails. I don't want anyone
               else incriminated.

                           WELLES NOONAN
               Agreed.

                         ME
                   (nod to agreement)
               I get a copy of that?

                         WELLES NOONAN
               After a judge signs it. Now Leave.

     Stand-nod-take my coffee-leave. Door closes. Noonan shreds
     the Witness agreement. Tosses it in the trash. Off the
     baffled Deputy.

                          WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D)
               We wait for him to deliver, then we
               arrest him. You never saw that
               agreement.

                           DEPUTY #1
               Tail him?

                         WELLES NOONAN
               No. Let him get comfortable...let
               him believe me.


83   INT. CAB - NIGHT                                             83

     Backseat. Suborned Cabby driving fast. LAPD on board.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Running out of room, time, both.
               Trapped between Bradley and Noonan.

     Jump out of the cab, into Wilhite's Powerhawk. Slide in, slam
     the door.


84   INT. MEG'S PLACE - LATER                                     84

     Bust in shaking. Teeth chatter like I'm freezing. Pete in the
     garage adjacent the kitchen, welder's goggles and a power
     drill, punching holes in Junior's safe.

                         PETE
               I know what Feds look like -- those
               were Feds with Junior...

                                                             98.



                         ME
               Yeah and they made me leaving the
               scene. Had to barter out.

                         PETE
               Barter what?

                         ME
               My Testimony. I signed a Federal
               Witness Agreement.

     Pete drops the drill.

                           PETE
               You what?

                          ME
               It's bullshit. Noonan's got no
               intention of honoring it.
                   (beat)
               They want Stemmons files though. I
               think Junior's been working angles
               for awhile, doing his own
               investigations.

                         PETE
               What did you do to his place? Nice
               quiet neighborhood one minute,
               Nagasaki the next.

                         ME
                   (point to safe)
               He had a hand grenade tied to that.
                   (as Pete resumes drilling)
               How much longer do you need?

                          PETE
               Few more hours. Maybe. Junior
               didn't skimp on this thing. I gotta
               bore right through the face plate.
                   (beat)
               You got some time now, why don't
               you get Milteer off my back and go
               work that Bledsoe broad.

                         ME
               You read my mind.


85   EXT. TOPANGA CANYON BUNGALOW - NIGHT                      85

     Pull in. Glenda's Vette parked behind. Lights on low inside.

                                                             99.




86   EXT./INT. BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER                        86

     The door opens. She's dressed for bed. I don't hesitate,
     afraid she'll shun me. Move to her, she doesn't startle. An
     arm around her waist, drawing her in, my mouth close to hers.

     I take her face in my hand, check her eyes, a beat before
     they tell me it's okay...I lean in, takes a lifetime...and
     kiss her soft until she kisses back, her mouth moving over my
     split lips, she puts her hands on my face, pulling me in.

     She feels exactly like I imagined.

     My coat comes off. Her camisole follows. We're moving toward
     a bed in back. I stop, pull back, the moonlight moves over
     her shoulders. I whisper:

                         ME
               ...tell me if I'm being too rough.

     Tears squeezed through smiling eyes, she kisses me even
     harder, pulls me down to her. We make love like we've never
     touched another. Everything blurs, burns down: Bradley.
     Wilhite. Tommy. Hector Junior. Ainge. She takes it all away.
     I escape into her. Hours fall. I could stay here forever...


87   INT. BEDROOM - LATER                                      87

     Lying there, staring at her. A silence and peace I've never
     known. Not once.

                         ME
               Tell me anything. Tell me
               everything.

     Label her surprise, her brow that furrows and unfurrows just
     as quickly. A long moment as she waivers...commits:

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               Where would I start?

                            ME
               Why here?

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               Why L.A.?
                   (this amazing smile)
               Why is anybody here? Want the rest
               of the world to know who they are.

                                                       100.



                    ME
          You?

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE
          No...I don't think so.
              (beat)
          I just love it. I grew up in
          Seattle. My aunt, every week, she'd
          take me to the movies.

Me watching her...tucks her hair back over his shoulders.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)                     *
          The idea that you can outlive
          yourself...that a part of you goes
          on, long after you're gone.
              (beat, grins)
          Sounds silly doesn't it? `Attack of
          the Atomic Vampires' being-

                    ME
          -your ticket to immortality?

Make her laugh. Swear a thousand silent oaths to protect her.
He face slowly goes dark.

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Hughes told me he could get me in
          for this screen test two years ago.
          Movie with Gregory Peck at
          Universal. He thought he was
          humoring me...until I got it. They
          offered me the role...there in the
          room. So Howard, who I'm sure never
          thought in a million years I'd land
          that part, makes some phone calls
          and just like that they don't want
          me anymore.
              (beat)
          Nobody calls now. I can't get in to
          see any studio casting people. He's
          ruined me in those circles.

                    ME
          And you still want it-

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          -bad enough to put on a silly
          cheerleading skirt and try to make
          the most god-awful dialogue sound
          decent.

                                                         101.



                    ME
          Surrounded by winos in werewolf
          suits.
              (she laughs, I laugh)
          That's...dedication.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Or desperation. Depends on the day.

The laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine.

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)
          I'll get there though.
              (beat)
          I'll get there.

I let the silence take...try not to shatter it with:

                    ME
          Dwight Gillette.

She doesn't blanch.

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE
          He asked me to take his `niece and
          nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard.
          These beautiful, funny little kids.
              (tears she doesn't swipe)
          I dropped them off. Didn't ask any
          questions -- I believed Dwight. A
          week later I saw their pictures in
          the Post Office. A week after that
          their little bodies came in on the
          tide near San Pedro.
              (beat, tears stream)
          I'll never shake the thought that
          maybe those poor kids thought I was
          part of it. That I knew what was
          going to happen to them. So I pray
          to God that he let them look in
          when I put that knife into Dwight.
              (beat)
          But I'll never ask his forgiveness
          for doing it...
              (beat, clears her eyes)
          Why do they call you `Enforcer?'

She actually gets closer, I can feel her breath on me.

                    ME
          I've killed 44 men.

                                                              102.



     She blanches, but never blinks...never takes her eyes away
     from mine.

                         ME (CONT'D)
               33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for
               profit -- mostly. Why did you sign
               with Hughes, knowing what he was?

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               `For profit -- mostly.'

     Silence. A feeling like: `and there we are...'

                         ME
               I'm not much good.

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               Me neither.

     She touches my quake. Two breaths with her hand on mine and
     it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. She
     takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. The only things
     audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. Both slowly fade out.

     BLACK.

     Wake up quiet, look at my Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit up slow.

     Look back at her, sleeping, just stare. I lean down, kiss her
     lightly, her taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's the
     last good thing you'll get today.


88   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.                                88

     Dark. Stay quiet. Maneuver into the kitchen. Turn on a light.
     On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short-
     stacks of files, $1000 in twenties. I sit, start searching
     for something else...Pete's voice behind me:

                         PETE (O.C.)
               The Knife ain't there. File on top
               of that middle pile: George Ainge
               in an `undisclosed locale.'

     I don't turn. Pete sits next to me. Sets a shotgun down.

                         PETE
               Junior documented everything like a
               fucking Monk.
                   (pulls a file)
               Like here: `has evidence' you
               murdered Sanderline Johnson.
                         (MORE)

                                                            103.

                     PETE (cont'd)
           Kept track of `suspected contract
           killings' you pulled for the mob.

Look at Pete. Dark rings, deathbed eyes.

                     ME
           You been up all night?

                     PETE
           In-case Stemmons made a house-call.
           He's got every goddamn address of
           everybody you know...
               (beat, hard)
           And you should've told me about the
           Bledsoe broad.

                     ME
           There's nothing to tell.

Feature Pete, righteously pissed:

                     PETE
           Then call Milteer about this dead
           Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind
           like you, but I'll bet a murder
           beef would violate her morals
           clause quick.
               (beat, hands phone)
           Collect the rest of your money.

                     ME
           I don't want it anymore.

                     PETE
           Then give that five grand back.

                     ME
           Junior stole it.

Pete pauses, scoffs, turns back toward Meg's bedroom walks:

                     PETE
           People are gonna start lining-up to
           see you bleed, Pal.

Door closes. I flip through Junior's files: the same
architect-neat block printing. Find a Glenda entry:

SUBSEQUENT TO HER FATAL STABBING OF DWIGHT Gillette, MISS BLEDSOE
SECRETED THE MURDER WEAPON WITH GEORGE AINGE. I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS
KNIFE. IT IS A SIX-INCH BLADE WITH A MOTHER-OF-PEARL GRIP WHICH
SUSTAINED RIGHT THUMB AND RIGHT INDEX PRINTS WHICH MATCH ELEVEN
COMPARISON POINTS TO FINGERPRINTS ON FILE FROM MISS BLEDSOE'S 1946
JUVENILE SHOPLIFTING ARREST.

                                                            104.



     Shred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript
     clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to
     the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan.

     Then I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY.
     Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover.
     Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across
     a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS'

     I read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge...


89   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING                           89

     Barrel down the hallway toward Bradley's office. A habitual
     eye toward Junior's desk: Koenig going through his drawers.
     Stop. Veer toward him...

                         KOENIG
                   (formal-frosty)
               Your young partner called me at my
               home, early this morning.

     Teeth grit. Hide it. Let Koenig talk.

                         KOENIG (CONT'D)
               Heavily inebriated. Speaking
               inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how
               the LAPD was set to be `blitzed by
               justice.' Is this the `bind' of
               which we spoke earlier?

                         ME
               Yeah.

                         KOENIG
               And his apartment -- there was some
               type of disturbance? A fire?

                         ME
               That's why I needed his address. I
               was trying to help him before
               something like this happened. The
               kid snapped-in-half Fritz. He's
               literally lost it.
                   (beat, deadpan)
               He say anything else to you?

     Koenig looks back at me. Give nothing away...one gesture that
     doesn't read right and he'll know. He lets more seconds pass
     than he should. Trying to shake me.

                                                            105.



                         KOENIG
               Only that he was in possession of
               materials that might deeply damage
               Chief Bradley...and yourself.

                         ME
               Like I said Fritz, he's flipped his
               lid. I don't want to go to Internal
               Affairs but I'm afraid Junior
               might've forced just that.

                         KOENIG
               Let me try to locate the lad first
               Dave. Be a shame to ruin such a
               young career so soon.

                         ME
               Be careful Fritz. He's dangerous.

     Spin, press on toward Bradley's office.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in
               the LAPD, digging. He'll find
               Junior and when he does he'll find
               Ainge...then Glenda...

     Reach Bradley's office, burst in. Empty. To his Secretary:

                         ME
               Where is he?

                         SECRETARY
                   (frowns at my informality)
               Out at the Ravine Lieutenant.


90   EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE - DAY                                     90

     Park the Powerhawk. Downwind. Out. Walking. Check my
     Hamilton: 12:10 PM.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Noonan's deadline lapsed ten
               minutes ago. An official fugitive
               from justice now.

     Down below, Bradley with Reuben Ruiz in-tow: glazed-fear,
     following him like he's handcuffed. PROTESTORS gather,
     placards hoisted, chants: "Dodgers, No! Mexico, Si!" The
     group gathers steam, supporters pack in, the chorus
     continues: "DODGERS NO! MEXICO SI!'

                                                       106.



                    ME (V.O.)
          Bradley doing damage control, the
          forced relocation of the Ravine's
          immigrants has the press in a
          feeding frenzy. Reuben Ruiz forced
          along as the token Mexican
          mouthpiece.

Reporters press. Bradley handles them with ease and aplomb.

                    BRADLEY
          -this area has long been rife with
          crime and venality, but with a
          brand new Stadium, we can make this
          horrible blight a bright spot and
          give our Los Angeles Dodgers the
          home they deserve.
              (like Ruiz was an orphan)
          Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his
          travails growing up in this
          horrible slum and why now is the
          time to `Redeem The Ravine.'

                    REPORTER #2
          Chief Bradley, U.S. Attorney
          Noonan has promised to deliver
          surprise witnesses before the
          Federal Grand jury on-

-Bradley, this brilliant rebuke:

                    BRADLEY
          -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous
          hack politician whose smear
          campaign against us will fail, for
          he has grievously underestimated
          the moral rectitude of the Los
          Angeles Police Department.

Then Bradley sees me. His press-friendly face contorts, the
shift startling: if only a flashbulb could've framed it. He
shifts back from snarl to smile...

                    BRADLEY
          Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave
          you with Reuben Ruiz.

Ruiz begins his forced/coerced/do-it-or-we'll-fuck-you sob
story as Bradley steps away from the glare. I follow. Get
right on his heels.

                                                          107.



                    ME
          Your subpoena hasn't caught up to
          me yet, Chief...

Bradley spins back.

                    ME (CONT'D)
              (hand him Junior's file)
          Hurwitz Holdings.

Bradley blanches, buckles. I see it. Before he can play
stupid with: `What?'

                    ME (CONT'D)
          You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought
          big chunks of Chavez Ravine over
          the past two years through a shell
          company called Hurwitz Holdings.
              (beat, look around)
          If the Dodgers move here the value
          of the land booms...you could sell
          it off for a fortune -- or hang
          onto it and make even more. The
          parking lots alone would make you
          all multi-millionaires.

Bradley removes his glasses, staring at documentation that
dooms both his immediate and distant future...

                    ME
          Word gets out that the three City
          Officials who were pushing hardest
          for a Stadium also stood to gain a
          mint -- might color public opinion.
          Might color it even more to know
          that the LAPD's Chief of Detectives
          was trying to purchase a huge tract
          of that land from the biggest dope
          dealer in town.

Slap another file over the one he's reading.

                    ME
          Hector Magdalena owned ten and half
          acres of this land.
              (beat, ram him)
          You didn't give a shit about
          solving his disappearance. You were
          worried that your real estate deal
          was going south.
                    (MORE)

                                                       108.

                     ME (cont'd)
          That's why you wanted Tommy found,
          not because he was a murder suspect
          or you were concerned that Noonan
          might tap him as a federal
          witness...you needed him to
          finalize your fucking land grab. To
          sign paperwork in place of his dead
          Dad. That's why you've got Madge
          and Lucille in custody now.
              (beat)
          Maybe I'll let your subpoena find
          me now Chief, maybe I'll walk right
          into it...the tales I could tell.

All Bradley can muster is:

                    BRADLEY
          How?

                    ME
          Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence
          teacher. His `excellent ratings'
          didn't stop him from stealing the
          Magdalena seizure and doing his own
          investigation.

                    BRADLEY
          Why would he investigate me?

Hand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in
American Blue.

                     ME
          That was stapled to the cover.
              (beat)
          Why would Noonan worry about a Turd
          like me now...when a high profile
          target like you can be taken down.

Silence. I smile wide at it. Bradley, scrambling.

                    BRADLEY
          Where is Stemmons?

                    ME
          No idea. If you haven't spoken to
          Internal Affairs today, I'm sure
          they've called. Junior's apartment
          caught fire. Deeply deviant
          material inside. Round him up-
              (my angle)
          -and anyone he's got with him.

Bradley readjusts his glasses.

                                                         109.



                    BRADLEY
          I'll issue an A.P.B. saying
          Stemmons is a known deviant
          targeting kindergarten children.

                    ME
          Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed
          Wilhite too.

Bradley's reaction: Feature the angler getting angled.

                      BRADLEY
          How do y-

                    ME
          -don't worry `how.' Why?

Bradley says nothing. Then, like a klieg-light, it hits me.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          You're going after Narco yourself.

                    BRADLEY
          Exposing the corrupt parts of the
          LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll
          prove that Police can police
          themselves-

                    ME
          -so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his
          crusade and condemn your own before
          he can...Jesus Christ can you turn
          lemons to lemonade.

                    BRADLEY
          No Cop will testify against other
          Cops. This is why Wilhite has
          suddenly disappeared.

                     ME
          And how.
              (beat)
          So where do we go now Chief?

                    BRADLEY
              (beat, eyes flick again to
               the files I'm holding...)
          There are other forces at work
          here...faces we need to identify.
          Names we need to know. A third
          party.

                                                            110.

                         BRADLEY (cont'd)
               Find out who Klein and I'll
               reinstate you, rescind that
               subpoena & burn the coroner's
               report on Sanderline-

                         ME
               -that report is only useful to
               Noonan now.

                         BRADLEY
               No. It ensures our mutual
               destruction should you choose to
               share the contents of that Stemmons
               file. Which I know you won't do
               until you figure out how it will
               best benefit you.

     He walks off, imperious, impervious, gets engulfed by the
     press ranks once again.

                         ME (V.O.)
               A mistake to underestimate me now
               Chief. The price to keep your
               secrets is steep...and you're going
               to pay up. Soon.

     Back to the Powerhawk, fresh-scrubbed six-packs standing near
     it, the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment. They
     see me, deferential nods. One squeaky wheel offers:

                         SIX-PACK
               Something in your trunk smells to
               high hell Lieutenant.

                            ME
               Dead body.

     Laughter. Easily amused academy types. Brush by grinning,
     give `em an "Enforcer" story to tell the other rookies. I
     jump in the Powerhawk and tear off.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Borrowed time burning fast. My days
               are done. Only hours remain.
               Whatever moves I have left...make
               them now.


91   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - LATER                                     91

     Going through files. Filling my own steno pad with scrawl.
     Pete walks in from the garage, face bunched up, bit-lemon.

                                                       111.



                    PETE
          Fucking Christ. You can't keep that
          car in the garage, the smell's
          coming into the house.

Meg wanders in, dressed for work.

                    MEG
          Open the windows.

                    PETE
          That's not gonna help.

                    ME
              (still scribbling)
          Take a couple bottles of bleach,
          pour it over the trunk.

                    PETE
          What do you got in there?

                    ME
          My foreseeable future.

                    MEG
          I'm going to work.

She kisses me on my head. I turn:

                    ME
          You taking her?

                    PETE
              (God damn glowering)
          I'm taking her.

Meg walks out. Pete lingers. I'm starting to sour him. Not
smart. He stares. I look up.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          What?

                    PETE
          Hughes.

                    ME
          This is almost over Pete -- I'll
          give Milteer the five-grand back.

                    PETE
          It's more than that.

                                                       112.



                    ME
          I'll square it. It's my thing.

                    PETE
          That you made mine.

                       ME
          I'm sorry.

A beat. Pete sketches me head to toe.

                    PETE
          Look as bad as I've ever seen you.

                    ME
          Things are as bad as they've ever
          been...

Pete exhales. Stalks off. I keep scribbling.

                    ME (V.O.)
          Bradley's Third Party Theory.
          Everything linked: Wilhite,
          Magdalena, the Ravine...I've got my
          own theories...and the one that
          sticks is the one I pray I'm wrong
          about.

Meg's phone blares, I answer it on reflex.

                       ME (CONT'D)
          Klein.

I hear rasp on the other end, hyperventilating, unhinged.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          MOTHERFUCKER -- you better meet me!
          That Cooze you threw everything
          away for is still cooked! I got the
          knife. I got Ainge-

Junior. Jesus.

                    ME
          How'd you get this number Junior?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          I got everything on you! AND I'M
          GONNA USE IT!

                    ME
          -you're a broom-closet Queer. Your
          career is over.

                                                       113.



                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          The knife for MY file on Bradley.
          I know you already burned that
          Whore's but don't think I can't re-
          do investigations.

                    ME
          You snitch to Noonan, then what?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Fuck Noonan. I got stronger Allies.

                    ME
          Who? The Soviets?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Meet me in one hour with that file,
          Fern Dell Park-

                    ME
          -Where you used to snag fruits for
          Vice? A volunteer gig I'm guessing.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Be there with Bradley's file or I
          scratch your scabby Bitch.

                    ME
          Hey, did the Feds dig your pad?

The phone on the other end seems to break-in half. Hang up,
it rings a beat later. Junior still wanting to spar. Snag the
receiver, rip his shit:

                    ME (CONT'D)
          -I see anybody near there Junior,
          the deals off and I gift that file
          to Bradley to fuck you with-

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          -Dave?

                    ME
              (big beat)
          Glenda?

He's got her. Junior. Sick. Evil. My mind cannibalizes itself
with "where-is-she-how-do-I-get-her-back" when:

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Sorry...you gave me this number...

He doesn't have her. A sigh so big, it steals all my air...

                                                            114.



                           ME
                 Jesus...hey...


92   INTERCUT:                                                  92

                           GLENDA
                 Who were you talking-

                           ME
                 -no, no. It's nothing. I had a
                 phone call, just before yours.

     A beat. Glenda in a chaise lounge on a small deck overlooking
     the canyon. She sits up.

                           GLENDA
                 Was it him? The Cop you were
                 telling me about?

                           ME
                 I don't want you to worry. I'm
                 handling it. But I might send my
                 friend Pete out there.

                           GLENDA
                 You don't think it's safe?

                           ME
                 I'd just rather have someone there
                 with you.

                           GLENDA
                 I wish you would've woken me up
                 this morning.

                           ME
                 I'm better-looking in low light, I
                 didn't want to blow it for myself.

     She laughs. Makes me smile despite my world caving-in...

                           ME (CONT'D)
                 Stay by the phone.

                           GLENDA
                 I miss you.

     And I melt. Love-struck at possibly the worst fucking moment
     of my life. Hang up before your voice breaks. Grab a pen,
     scrawl for Pete, post it on the fridge magnet: `PETE: 655
     TOPANGA. STAY WITH HER. PLEASE.'

                                                            115.




93   EXT. FERN DELL PARK - EVENING                             93

     Rolling green. Half-dirt, half-asphalt path. I scan for any
     back-up. Nothing. Junior already there. Astride like Gary
     Cooper. His eyes bloodshot from here. My gun riding quick-
     draw style. The heft feels good. Unbutton my coat to show him
     the file as I approach, tucked right behind my .45.

                         ME
               Where's the knife.

     Junior, this evil little curl. He turns. Follow him over a
     small knoll: that Gray Packard, waiting. A silhouette behind
     the wheel. As we near it the lights come on, blind me.

                         ME
               Turn your lights off...and just
               come out and talk to me...Fritz.

     A pause in the car, Junior looks at me like I'm Rasputin,
     divining answers from the marine-layer moving-in over LA. The
     lights pop off and I hear a tired laugh coming from the car
     that we've all heard before.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Third Party Confirmed...I fucking
               knew it.

     Fritz Koenig steps out of the Packard.

                         KOENIG
               Not much with these sub-rosa
               things...

                         ME
                   (a nod to the Packard)
               I thought it was Noonan tailing me.

                         KOENIG
               Bradley's greatest stroke was
               enlisting you to his side.

     Junior, jumpy in my periphery. I don't like it.

                         ME (CONT'D)
               Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not
               Narco.

                         KOENIG
               When did you know?

                                                              116.



                         ME
               I didn't. I had a feeling. I
               smelled cover-up all over Hector's
               disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't
               have the muscle or the mind-set to
               kingpin something that big by
               himself...you knew about Bradley
               trying to buy him out?

                         KOENIG
               He was offering to exonerate Hector
               and clear his criminal record.
               Hector met with Wilhite and I to
               inform us of his decision...

                                                    FLASHBACK TO:


94   INT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - PAST                                94

     For the first and only time, WE SEE Hector Magdalena, alive
     and well...for the moment...speaking to Koenig and Wilhite.

                         KOENIG (V.O.)
               ...to accept Bradley's deal...

     Koenig pets Hector's twin Doberman guard dogs.

                         KOENIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...and although the terms of that
               deal worked well for him. I found
               them less than favorable...

     Koenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before
     shooting a shocked Hector twice in the chest. Wilhite
     staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the
     coup de grace head-shot to Hector.

                         KOENIG
               Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots
               for Human Vice. These are slums I
               run & profit from. If these slums
               suddenly become Stadiums, that
               profit goes elsewhere...that crime
               goes elsewhere.

                         ME
               Bradley...you two got greed in
               common.

     Koenig grins. Junior keeps shifting. Dying to shoot him dead.

                                                       117.



                    ME
          You knew about Wilhite and Lucille.
          That's how you were operating him.

                    KOENIG
          I was aware of his sexual
          predilections.

                    ME
              (a scowl for Junior)
          ...and someone else's...

                     KOENIG
              (that great white grin )
          We share an eye for human frailty
          and we're both born blackmailers
          Dave.
              (beat)
          I knew young Stemmons here had a
          fondness for Lads, stretching back
          to his days at the academy.

                    ME
          And now you're his only ally.
              (back at Junior)
          This sad queer who fell out with
          cops and flunked out with the Feds.
              (back to Koenig)
          So you get this file to battle
          Bradley with. What's Junior get in
          return?

And like he was waiting for those words: Junior lunges. I
twist to deflect but he's too fast -- feel something sink and
drag in my side. I go down, gouge/groping for my gun. Instant
trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing. Then a
pain like boiling oil moves through my blood.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          JUST YOU! YOU FUCK!

Look down, SEE: A mother-of-pearl knife hilt in my side, the
business end stuck deep. Junior laughing as I fall to my
knees. He pulls the file from the waist and tosses my .45.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
              (two inches from my face)
          THERE'S YOUR KNIFE KLEIN!

Koenig takes the file, opening it.

                                                       118.



                    KOENIG
              (turning his back)
          I don't want to watch...I'm sorry
          it came to this, Dave.

Junior, his own .45 pulled, put to my head.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth
          it...'cuz she's still fucked. For a
          crooked cop, you think small.

Koenig reads the file's first page, lifts it...a blank page
behind...and behind that one...

                    ME (V.O.)
          Whatever moves I had left...I just
          made.

Koenig spins back, more blank pages spilling from the file.

                    KOENIG
          This isn't it!

-Junior looks: that's all I need. Pull the pig-sticker off my
ankle and corkscrew it into his calf, twisting. Junior bleats
slaughtered-lamb as I reach up a wrench his gun free. Grab
his tie, pull him down as I jut his gun up under his chin and
fire two shots through the top of his head.

Haul him down dead by his tie, turn -- Koenig's gun-hand
flashes to his shoulder. Shoot him twice. He goes down
gargling `fuck'. Stand-up on me sea-legs, bad wobble/weave as
I slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it. Feel blood
flow saturate my pant leg. This weird wooze overcomes me as I
approach Koenig.

He pulls himself into a sitting position, shaking his head.
This bemused, beaten, half-grin as he flicks blood from his
hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky.

                    KOENIG
          Poorly played Dave...poorly
          played...

Say nothing. Keep Junior's .45 out. My intention crystal
clear: endgame. Koenig looks up, this odd squint, like a bum
about to beg for change.

                    KOENIG
          Could I talk you into something?
          Cut you in on something?

                                                            119.



     Give him no hope.

                         ME
               Won't work for me Fritz.

     He nods, remorse, resignation...it at all looks the same now.

                         KOENIG
               Give me a minute then?

     I do. Watch his hands as he removes his shoes, waiting for an
     ankle grab, his back-up piece...none comes. He sets his shoes
     aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this
     short, gruff laugh...some inside joke that will die untold.

                         KOENIG
                   (with a nod)
               Okay...

     ...and he holds his last breath and seems completely content
     as I shoot him. Cross to Junior now, rifle his clothes,
     retrieve a hotel key, Room 16, read it: MOTEL COMMODORE -
     1195 Centinela Ave. Inglewood, CA 90302


95   INT. MOTEL COMMODORE - INGLEWOOD - LATE NIGHT             95

     George Ainge, sweating on a stained bedsheet, smoking reefer,
     goofing on a TV test pattern, randomly pulling at his dick.
     Walk by his window, he sees me, recognition kinks -- thinks
     this is a good sign...I shoot him right through the glass.


96   EXT. TUDOR MANSION - EARLY A.M.                           96

     Bradley, roused from sleep, silk robe, coming down the
     stairs, his back door wide open. Reaches the landing, turns
     on the light.

     Feature me, this bobble-eyed ghoul, bloodying his settee. I
     look like something exhumed. His monogrammed serving napkins
     soak up blood from my knifed side. He startles school-girl.
     Throw the file at his feet: marred, mangled, stained. He
     inches forward, cinching his robe.

                         BRADLEY
               Who?

                         ME
               Fritz Koenig.

                                                       120.



                      BRADLEY
                (going pale)
            Where?

                      ME
            Dead. Along with Wilhite,
            Junior...and Hector Magdalena.

                      BRADLEY
            Why are you here?

                      ME
            To collect. I have the things you
            need to destroy Noonan's play.
            These same things can be used to
            destroy you.

Bradley, prim, proper, even this early. He sits down across
from me like some fucking Duke.

                      BRADLEY
            Things like?

                      ME
            Stemmons files...and Wilhite's
            body. He committed suicide after
            you subpoenaed him.

                      BRADLEY
            This body is in your possession?

Just nod.

                      ME
            And it's what you need to burn
            Narco to the ground...but if those
            files and his body were to be given
            to Noonan and the Feds, with me
            providing the cherry-on-top
            testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The
            word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind.

                      BRADLEY
            What will this cost?

                      ME
            A percentage of your Dodger Stadium
            stake in perpetuity. You buy my
            silence for a fourth of Hurwitz
            Holdings.

Bradley scoffs, pithy smile.

                                                               121.



                           BRADLEY
               Doubtful.

                         ME
               What'd you expect? A stick-up?
               Empty your safe? I'm about to
               disappear for good, and you're
               gonna fund my new life. You can't
               counter-punch out of this. Arrest
               me and I snitch the world.
                   (point to the file)
               I'll hold that over your head for
               the rest of your life. Renege on
               our deal and it won't matter if
               it's tomorrow or ten years from
               now...I'll fry you with that file.
                   (at my cracked Hamilton)
               I'm officially outta time now
               Chief. Call it.

     Bradley: an actual, full-blown facial tic. His Adam's apple
     bobs as he realizes that he's finally been beaten.

                         BRADLEY
               Wilhite's body...Bury it.


97   INT. PETE'S CADILLAC - MORNING                               97

     Cruising up the Topanga Canyon. Almost home...

                         ME (V.O.)
               Shaking to see her, touch her...


98   EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING                                      98

     Door locked. Knocking. Pete opens up. Standing drunk. A
     pissed-off nod.


99   INT. BUNGALOW - NEXT MOMENT                                  99

     Liquor wafts off of him.

                         ME
               You go to bed drunk, or just been
               up all night.

     No answer as I follow him into the house.

                         KLEIN
               Where's Glenda, is she asle-

                                                       122.



-round the corner: Glenda shaking but refusing to cry. I go
pale: what is this? Somebody to the left, look: Milteer. Look
back at Pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with
a right cross.

                    ME (V.O.)
          Seen Pete do this a dozen times and
          every time the same thought: God
          help me if he ever hits me like
          that...

Instant-drop, moan. Glenda screaming.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          Don't kill me.

Pete looks to Milteer, wipes blurred eyes.

                    MILTEER
          The harder you hit him the quicker
          I say `stop' -- and cease that
          absurd crying.

Pete bludgeons me. I try to get closer to Glenda. Feel my
nose shatter. Another swing: right cheek detonates. A left
hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes.
Glenda's crying/screaming gets me madder than anything.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
              (at Milteer)
          THAT IMPOTENT SHIT-

                    MILTEER
          -touch me and he dies.

Pete knocks me down again. My face in pieces.

                    MILTEER (CONT'D)
          Kick him-kick him-kick him.

Pete hesitates, puts his boot into my guts: 1, 2, 3-

                    MILTEER (CONT'D)
              (prim, official)
          -you may stop.
              (beat, for the room)
          Howard determined that this was the
          price for your time together.

Milteer produces a Polaroid, takes a snapshot of my shattered
husk, hands the camera to Pete on his way out:

                                                             123.



                          MILTEER
                You still have a job.

      Milteer gone. I spit volumes of blood. I'll talk with a slur
      for the next year. Pete reaches for me, blotto, sobbing.

                          PETE
                ...I'm sorry Dave...

      Pushing out words past shattered teeth.

                          ME
                I put you here...that Powerhawk-

                          PETE
                -there's a body in the trunk-

                             ME
                -burn it.

      Big drunk nod from Pete. Glenda panicking, trying to stanch
      blood that keeps rushing. Pete, reeling drunk, leans down,
      stuffs something in my jacket.

                          PETE
                I'm so sorry....


100   INT. SHOWER - TIME UNKNOWN                               100

      Steaming water. Almost painful. I sit in the tub, let the
      shower rain down. Drain floods diluted red. Wash my wounds,
      my soul. So many bruises I look bubonic. My face still
      swelling, already purple-black. My left eye more than swollen
      shut. On the other side of the curtain:

      Glenda naked. Beauty that catches in my chest. Try to stand,
      turn my destroyed face. She gently pushes me back down. Sits
      into me, holds my face in both hands so that the water hits
      my lips. No nerves, no unease. Home. She closes the curtain.


101   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     101

      Post-coital. Both wide awake. Still scared.

                          GLENDA
                Let me take you to a hospital.

                          ME
                We'd never make it inside.

                                                             124.



                          GLENDA
                    (big beat)
                I'm worried.

                          ME
                I'm through the worst of it.

      She frames my face with her hands.

                          GLENDA
                I don't believe you.

      Lies will only leak, expose. The silence makes me just as
      guilty. She lets me off the hook, her head on my arm, leaning
      in. I kiss her.

                          GLENDA (CONT'D)
                    (at a whisper)
                Was I worth this?

                          ME
                Whatever the cost.

                          GLENDA
                Just like that then?

                          ME
                Just like that.

      A nod. An understanding. Another kiss, the last one I'll
      remember.


102   INT. COLD WATER CANYON BUNGALOW KITCHEN - BLACK A.M.       102

      Head shaved. Stopped bleeding. You clearly see what my face
      will look like 25 years hence. Gauze over my left eye.
      Reading the Paper: my dress-blue photo, the one that looks
      nothing like me now. Headline:

           `LAPD Officer Wanted in Connection with
           Recent Rash of Murders...U.S. Attorney
           Welles Noonan issued a nationwide warning
           to law enforcement...'

                          ME (V.O.)
                My deadline with Noonan: two days
                old. He and Bradley playing chess
                by press release.
                          (MORE)

                                                             125.

                           ME (V.O.) (cont'd)
                Bradley relocates the deaths of
                Captain Fritz Koenig and Sergeant
                Richard Stemmons to Chavez
                Ravine...both given posthumous
                Medals of Valor. Junior dies a hero
                after all.

      INSERT: TELEVISION SCREEN

      Bradley: Professorial in glasses and pinstripes, mid-press
      conference. Watch him work...a statesman's guile.

                           ME (V.O.)
                Cop-killings clear the way for
                Bradley's "Redeem The Ravine'
                mandate. Dodger Stadium
                construction moves forward.
                    (beat)
                Captain Dan Wilhite and Hector
                Magdalena. Missing. APB's issued.

103   INT. BEDROOM - BLACK A.M.                                  103

      Just sit and watch Glenda. Listen to her sleep: rhythmic
      breathing. The little natural smiling curl to her lips.
      Blonde hair splayed over white sheets. Touch her.

                          ME (V.O.)
                I haven't loved you long enough to
                leave it all behind...Too many
                enemies. Too many ways for you to
                get hurt. Too close to me...a
                decision that will haunt me the
                rest of my days...

      The Gillette knife, fold it in a kerchief, gift-wrap it to
      Glenda. Place a letter under it on the night stand:

                          ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                "My Heaven: the hours I had with
                you. My Hell: the years ahead,
                without. Someday I'll see you
                before you even know I'm looking."

                                                               126.



      I stand quiet, `grief' the best word but still not enough.
      Choke back tears as I lift Pete's camera and take the black
      and white picture you've seen before.

      Put my jacket on, pull the paper out of my pocket that Pete
      planted...a TWA Airline voucher. I smile small...

                                                     FLASHBACK TO:

                          PETE

      A Times vending machine: paper blazing with front page photos
      of wanted cop Dave Klein. I walk right past my old face. Past
      Cops and Feds camped out, looking for me.

                           ME (V.O.)
                Pete's penance beating built me a
                brand new face...nobody gives me a
                second glance...not even the cops I
                recognize.

      Up to the TWA counter: glance up at the departures board-

      BLACK.

105   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                               105

      I'm old. Stare at my leather-tan, once-broken face in a
      gilded mirror. The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed
      uneven. I start to pack my suitcases. Old files you think you
      may have seen before. An old gun you know you've seen before.
      Movements slow and steady in my advancing age...

                           ME (V.O.)
                My will to remember. My confession

                     ME (V.O.) (cont'd)
          Me: gringo exile rich off funds

Look back down at HER picture.

                      ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding
          her name. Only a photograph,
          yellowed with years-passed,
          reminding me of everything I never
          was.
               (beat)
          Then a week-old Times at the place
          I buy coffee. Her picture sees me
          before I realize she's looking. Her
          Face eternal-beautiful...

Put her photo in my chest pocket. Push the week-old Times
into a waste-basket: a Pan-Am ticket to LA underneath.

                    ME (V.O.)
          ...and it asked me to revoke our
          time apart, redeem it...tell her
          anything...tell her everything...

I stand, shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long. And
as I step out, an old man twenty-five years too late, and my
MGM-handsome, 1958 face smiles back at me through the shards.

1. COVERED RIDING SCHOOL OF THE MANORIAL ESTATE INT/DAY
MONTAGE OF CLOSE-SHOTS:

                                                                1

A man is riding a dressage horse. We can't see his face.
Only his boots, spurs, whip, the taut reins, the horse's
foamy mouth, the movements that steer the animal.
We watch him for a while and hear the SNORTS of the
horse, the dull SOUND of THE HOOVES on the ground, the
fast-uttered COMMANDS of the rider. Then we start to
hear a gentle voice:

       NARRATOR (o.s.):I don't know if the story that I
       want to tell you, reflects the truth in every
       detail. Much of it I only know by hearsay, and a
       lot of it remains obscure to me even today, and
       I must leave it in darkness. Many of these
       questions remain without answer. But I believe I
       must tell of the strange events that occurred in
       our village, because they may cast a new light
       on some of the goings-on in this country...

LONG SHOT OF THE RIDING STABLES.
The rider is the village doctor, a gaunt, intellectual-
looking man of around 60, who has finished his dressage
session, and now rides toward the open gate beside the
CAMERA, goes through it and into the landscape. We see
him in the avenue, now visible behind him, and watch him
grow smaller until he vanishes.



       NARRATOR (o.s. continuing):...Everything began,
       if I remember correctly, with the doctor's
       riding accident. After his dressage session in
       the manor's riding school, he was first headed
       for his home...


                            



2.   THE DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY

The garden opens up on the meadows and fields of the
flat countryside.

The doctor lies beside his wounded horse. His arm is
strangely twisted, his broken collarbone has made a bump
in the blood-drenched jacket. He yells with pain.

After a few moments Xenia, the doctor's 12-year old
daughter, comes running out of the house. She rushes up
to her father and looks at him, horrified, then at the
twitching horse, screams with horror. Her father shouts
something to her, she bends over him and tries to raise
him to his feet. He screams at her as he's in such pain.

She staggers back helplessly, he shouts something to her
again, whereupon she runs off. We hear all this from far
away, because during the whole scene the narrator has
continued his tale:
                                                           2

       NARRATOR: ...to see if any of his patients had
       arrived. As it entered the property, the horse
       had tripped over a hardly visible, taut wire
       that had been strung between two trees.
       The doctor's fourteen-year old daughter had
       watched the accident from the window of the
       house, and was able to inform the woman who was
       their neighbor, who in turn got the message to
       the manor house, so that the agonizing doctor
       could be transported to the hospital of the
       district capital that was over 30 kilometers
       away...

                            



3.   VILLAGE-STREET AND SCHOOL EXT/DAY

TRACKING SHOT:
Emilie Wagner, a skinny, modestly dressed woman in her
late thirties hurries along the village street.

       NARRATOR: ...The neighbor, a single woman of
       around 40, was the village midwife, who had
       filled the invaluable position of housekeeper
       and receptionist for the doctor since the death
       of his wife in childbirth.
       After tending to the doctor's two children, she
       had gone to the school to fetch her own son,
       Hans. Since she didn't like leaving him alone,
       she asked me - in return for a small fee - to
       keep him at the school with me every day, after
       the other children had finished their lessons.
       But on the day of the riding accident there was
       choir practice in the afternoon, so that most of
       the children were still present.

A few children pass Emilie and greet her. Then she
reaches the school. The door is open. The schoolchildren
stream out.

We see the schoolteacher, a slight man, hardly 30 years
old, talking inside to some of the older students.
Martin, a tall gangly boy of around 12, whose elegant
clothes make him stand out among the other children
coming out of the school, turns to the midwife:

        MARTIN: Were you at Xenia's place?
He's interrupted by Marie, a delicate, pretty and polite
girl of around 13 who has the odd characteristic of
already behaving like an adult.
        MARIE: Can't you say hello? Good afternoon, Mrs.
        Wagner, excuse me.
       MIDWIFE: Hello, Marie.
                                                           3

        MARIE: We're so worried, you know. That's why
        Martin forgot his manners.
        MIDWIFE: That's all right.
        MARIE: How is the Doctor?
        MIDWIFE: Not very well.
        MARIE: Will he have to stay in the hospital?
        MIDWIFE: I don't know.


The midwife is tired of Marie's precocious and endless
questions. She peers over the heads of children
surrounding them, looking for someone in the classroom.

        MARIE: We'll take care of Xenia. Maybe, we can
        help her somehow.
        MIDWIFE (distracted): Good idea. It'll cheer her
        up.
She has seen her son, who's coming out of the door: he
is a mongoloid boy of 8. His name is Hans. He hesitates,
as he sees his mother surrounded by the others. The
midwife leaves the group and goes over to him.
        MIDWIFE: Well, did you enjoy the singing?
        HANS (nods eagerly): It was great!
The schoolteacher comes in.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Show your mother what you've been
        singing.
Hans looks doubtfully, first at the schoolteacher, then
at his mother, who nods at him encouragingly. After
hesitating for a second, he starts to SING:


        HANS: La... La... lalala...
MARIE turns to leave.


        MARIE: Good-bye, Sir. Good-bye, Mrs. Wagner.
Her saying good-bye acts as an invitation to the other
children: they also SAY GOOD-BYE, though some less
distinctively, and follow the girl.
TRACKING SHOT with the children. After a short distance,
Georg, a strong boy of around 13, shouts, encouraging
the others:

        GEORG: Last one is a rotten egg!


                                                           4

Then he sprints off. Most of the children follow him.
But Marie and some of the other kids merely walk off at
a brisk pace.
The CAMERA, that stopped when Georg ran off, now FOLLOWS
Marie, so that, after a while, the others can be seen
again at the far end of the street.


                            



4.   THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DAY
Xenia, who is herself in a pitiful condition, holds her
four-year-old brother Rudolph on her knees. She rocks
him and herself back and forth. As his head is bowed, we
can only guess that he's crying. After a while

        XENIA (quietly): If you want, I can cut out some
        animals for you, as I did last week?
No reaction.
        Would you like that?!
Rudolph shakes his head faintly.
        We could color them together, no?
No reaction.
        Or we could cut them from the lovely colored
        paper? The golden one, do you remember? The one
        I got for Easter?
No reaction. Xenia ends up pressing her head helplessly
against her little brother's head and mutters:
        Come on, come on.
They remain that way for a while. Finally Xenia raises
Rudolph high enough so she can stand up:

       All right! Now I'm going to make us something to
       eat. Mrs. Wagner has prepared everything, I...
       RUDOLPH (interrupts her softly, his head still
       bowed): What if he never comes back?
        XENIA (as if she hasn't understood): What?
Rudolph merely shakes his bowed head. Xenia kneels down
in front of her brother and tries to look into his eyes,
but the boy bows his head even deeper.

        XENIA (tenderly): Come on! Don't be stupid! It
        goes away just like the flu. Remember last
        winter? You were very sick, weren't you? And
        then, two weeks later...
A NOISE makes her cock her ear: it's as if something had
hit the window in the next room.
                                                           5

Xenia stands up and listens. SILENCE. And then, after
listening for a while, once again the same noise.
        XENIA: Hush!
She goes into the OTHER ROOM and, hiding behind the
curtain, looks out.
Outside, the group of children are gathered around
Marie. They look up at the house. They're waiting for
something.
After a while, Georg, the boy who earlier had urged them
to race, throws another stone at the window. Xenia is
startled. She hesitates. Finally, she opens the window.
        GEORG: Hi, Xeni!
Xenia doesn't answer. After a while
        MARIE(quietly): How are you? Can we help you?


                            

5.   MANOR EXT/NIGHT
The steward of the estate, a heavy set rustic man in his
mid fifties, is talking with the landowner (who's about
the same age). They are standing beside a team of
carthorses. With a torch the steward lights up a dead
horse that lies on the ground after being towed in by
the carthorses.
        STEWARD: ...its tendons were almost severed. It
        never would have recovered.
The landowner bends down and examines the wounds on the
pasterns of the dead animal's front legs.
        LANDOWNER: How did that thing get there? Didn't
        the Doctor say anything?
       STEWARD (with a snicker): He was in no mood to
       talk, with his collarbone sticking out of his
       throat. I asked his daughter. She has no idea.
       He always rides through those trees.
       LANDOWNER: Did you look at the wire?
       STEWARD: Of course. It's thin, but strong. You
       can hardly see it, if you don't look closely.
       LANDOWNER: But why was it tied there?
       STEWARD (shrugging): And at knee height! I don't
       know... Maybe so the kids could jump over it. No
       idea. I don't think the doctor himself was
       stupid enough to tie that thing there.
       LANDOWNER: Meaning?



                                                           6

       STEWARD: Meaning: I don't know. Anyway it was
       definitely put there intentionally and looks
       damn...


                            

6.   MANOR. LIVING ROOM ON THE TOP FLOOR. INT/NIGHT
Sigi, the 9-year old son of the landowner stands at the
window, and watches his father and the steward standing
in the torchlight beside the dead horse.
In the background MUSIC (Piano/violin).
After a short while the two men down in the courtyard
separate: the landowner heads to the manor, the steward
with the team of carthorses to a farm building.
Sigi turns away from the window and looks into the room.
There his mother Beatrix, a beautiful, nervous woman in
her late thirties, is sitting at a baby grand piano.
Beside her stands the tutor, holding a violin tucked
under his chin. He looks as if he's in his late
twenties, plump and slightly greasy, and obviously
infatuated with his beautiful employer, who has just
interrupted her playing with an annoyed sigh.
        TUTOR: I'm sorry, Madame. You're just playing
        too well for me.
       BEATRIX:   Stop  apologizing   and  concentrate.
       That'll be more helpful for both of us.
        TUTOR: To tell the truth: You're just playing
        too fast for me. I'm not Paganini.
Beatrix looks up at him with a quick amused smile, then
turns back the pages of her sheet music.
        BEATRIX: Well, let's start all over again at the
        letter D.
The tutor does the same, they glance at each other and
start again.
Sigi watches them from the window, then he saunters in,
stops some distance away and watches. Then he saunters
away again.
Suddenly, Beatrix stops playing again.
        BEATRIX: Listen, darling. If you like the music,
        then sit down beside me and turn the pages of
        the sheet music. But if you're bored, go up to
        your room and at least stay out of my sight. It
        makes me nervous if you're constantly sauntering
        around in front of me.
Sigi bows his head ashamed, but doesn't move.
        BEATRIX (turning to the tutor): By the way, what
        time is it? Where is the girl?
The tutor pulls out his pocket watch.

                                                           7

       TUTOR: She's with the twins, I presume. Twenty
       to nine.
       BEATRIX: Twenty to nine?! (turning to Sigi): You
       should have been in bed long ago. (to the
       tutor): Has he done his homework?
       TUTOR: Of course, Madame.
        BEATRIX: All right. (to Sigi): Well, do you want
        to turn the pages for me or not?
Sigi nods.
        BEATRIX: Then come here!
With a little caustic smile, she taps beside her on the
piano bench. Sigi comes over sits down beside her and
looks at the sheet music. Beatrix turns the pages back.
        BEATRIX (to the tutor): All right, here we go
        again: the letter D. Try to play a bit faster.
        Or else I might as well play with the village
        schoolteacher.
They PLAY again. Sigi reads the music with her, then
turns the page.


                            



7.   RECTORY. DINING ROOM. INT/NIGHT
Marie and Martin come through the door and stand in
front of it.
At the dinner table, the pastor (in his mid-forties)
sits with his back to the door. In front of him, at the
other end of the table, sits his wife Anna, a woman in
her late forties. On the sides of the table sit the
children:
Anton (11), Magdalena (10), Katharina (9) and Florian
(7). Two other places are empty.
The table is set for 8 people, but the plates are empty.
SILENCE.
         MARIE (quietly): Please forgive us.
        MARTIN (following her lead): Please forgive us.
SILENCE. Then the pastor speaks very quietly, without
turning to the two children:

       PASTOR: There's no question of forgiving. You
       haven't offended me. It's your mother and your
       brothers and sisters that you have frightened
       away and offended. Ask them for forgiveness.
       You amaze me. I didn't know that the two oldest
       and therefore most reasonable of my children
       wouldn't mind frightening their mother and
       brothers and sisters to death.
                                                           8

He turns around toward the two children:
        Are you now grown up enough to live on your own?
        Are you? Do you want to leave home and start a
        life of your own? So you can come and go as you
        please, and nobody gets in your way. Is that
        what you want?
The two remain silent, their heads bowed. The pastor
turns his back to them again, and faces the table.

       Nobody at this table has eaten tonight. When it
       grew dark, and you hadn't returned, your mother
       went all over the village in tears, looking for
       you. Do you really think we could've enjoyed our
       meal, if we feared something had happened to
       you?
       Do you think we can enjoy our meal now, when
       you've come back and dish up lies as an excuse?
       I don't know what's worse: your absence or your
       coming back. (PAUSE).
       Tonight we shall all go to bed hungry.

He stands up, followed by the mother and the children
who were sitting at the table. Again he turns to the two
wrongdoers:
        PASTOR: You probably agree with me, that I
        cannot leave your offense unpunished, if we want
        keep living in mutual respect. So, tomorrow
        evening at this hour, I shall give each of you
        10 strokes of the cane. Until then, you have
        time to ponder over your offense. Do you agree
        with me?
       MARIE and MARTIN: Yes, Father.
        PASTOR: All right then. Go to bed now, all of
        you.
The children who were sitting at the table go first to
their mother, then to their father. They kiss their
hands and leave the room. As Marie and Martin want to do
the same, the father says
        PASTOR: I refuse to be touched by you. Your
        mother and I will sleep poorly because we know I
        have to hurt you tomorrow, and because it will
        more painful to us than the strokes will be
        painful to you. Leave us alone and go to bed.
As the two children are about to leave the room, he says
        PASTOR: When you were small, your mother once in
        a while would tie a ribbon in your hair or
        around your arm. Its white color was to remind
        you of innocence and purity. I thought that at
        your age you were well-mannered enough to get by
        without such reminders. I was wrong. Tomorrow,
        once you've been purified by your punishment,
                                                           9

        your mother will tie such a ribbon on you again,
        and you'll wear it until your behavior shows us
        that we can trust you again.


                               



8.    THE DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY
CLOSE ANGLE: one of the trees to which the wire was tied
that tripped up the doctor's horse. A policeman is
looking for clues.
With him are Xenia, Rudolph, the midwife and her son
Hans.
The    two  boys   don't  show   much  interest  in   the
investigation. They run after each other in the garden
and the neighboring fields. Hans especially seems enjoy
this, and is shrieking with delight.
         POLICEMAN: Where is the wire now?
The midwife looks at Xenia, who shrugs her shoulders.
         POLICEMAN: Then who took it away?
        XENIA: I don't know.
        POLICEMAN: You weren't here?

Xenia, uncertain, looks at the midwife.

        POLICEMAN:   Did   you   accompany   your   father?   To
        town?
        XENIA: No.
        POLICEMAN: That means you were here.
        XENIA: I was in school. Today.
        POLICEMAN: And when you left for school, the
        wire was still here?
        XENIA: I didn't check.


The policeman turns to the midwife:

        POLICEMAN: And when did you come?
        MIDWIFE: At noon. I make lunch for the Doctor
        and the kids. Since the death of the Doctor's
        wife, I've been helping him out.
        POLICEMAN: Since when?


                                                                   10

        MIDWIFE: It's been 4 years. Since the birth of
        little Rudolph. I'm the midwife here. We often
        work together.
        POLICEMAN: But you didn't see anything?
        MIDWIFE: No.
        POLICEMAN: Do you have any idea how long the
        wire had been there?
        MIDWIFE: I'd never seen it before.
         POLICEMAN (angrily): Let me get this straight:
         Nobody saw the thing before, nobody saw it
         afterwards. It wound itself around the two trees
         all alone, and made itself vanish after the
         doctor's fall. Right?
Neither the midwife nor Xenia know what to answer. At
that moment Hans comes running in from the field,
excited:
         HANS: Mother! ... Look! ...Look... come!
        MIDWIFE (reluctantly): What's happening?
        HANS: People! ...Lots of people. Come!!
        MIDWIFE (to the policeman): Sorry...
Indeed, as the midwife sets outs for the field, a group
of people hurry along the path bordering the doctor's
property, and cross our POV. They carry a body on a
makeshift stretcher. The policeman and Xenia follow the
midwife. The group vanishes as quickly as it appeared
behind the surrounding bushes.
As the group was approaching, we have been hearing
        NARRATOR: The day following the doctor's riding
        accident not only brought no solution to the
        question of who'd done it, but a second, far
        more tragic incident almost made people forget
        the misfortune of the previous day: the wife of
        a tenant farmer died in a work-accident.


                            



9.   FARM INT/DAY
It's very dark in the low-ceilinged room. Small windows.
A couple of women in peasant dresses take care of the
dead woman, who's been laid out on the bed. The women
remove her clothes and wash her.
        NARRATOR: The woman, who because of an injured
        arm could only do light work, had been dispensed

                                                            11

         by the steward from harvesting chores, and was
         assigned to easier work in the sawmill.
Everything happens very silently. An elderly woman, a
midwife specialized in bathing, takes care of the
proceedings.
Every time the door is opened, one hears the mutterings
of the people waiting outside. Soiled water is carried
out, new underwear brought in, and the women start to
clothe the naked corpse again.
Outside, the sounds of excited VOICES are getting
louder. Then the door opens and the farmer (around
fifty) enters the room. The old midwife turns around
angrily:
         BATHING-MIDWIFE: You stay outside! I haven't
         yet...
        FARMER (quietly): Get out!
Reluctantly, the old midwife abandons her half completed
work, not without having spread the dress she had draped
over the still half-naked body of the dead woman. The
other women follow her, embarrassed.
Once the door has closed behind them, the farmer just
stands there. Only after a long while does he move
forward and sit beside his dead wife. He remains seated,
motionless. For a very long time. He only tugs once at
the dress draped over the half-naked body, as if he
wanted to cover a patch of nudity. Then he just sits
there again in the dark room, and only his halting
breath lets us know that any moment he may cry.


                            



10. A RIVER AND MEADOW WITH BRIDGE EXT/DAY
With his net and his fishing rod the schoolteacher is
landing a fish.
        NARRATOR: On the same day, I had a strange
        encounter: the weather was beautiful and hot, so
        I decided to try and improve my meager menu with
        some brown trout, which are plentiful in the
        river. The landowner apparently liked me, and
        allowed me to fish.
Suddenly, the schoolteacher stops dead: like a tightrope
walker Martin is walking along on the top of the wall of
the bridge, thirty feet above the riverbed.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (shouts, fearful): Martin!
The boy doesn't seem to hear him and keeps up his
balancing act.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (louder): Martin!!
The boy keeps at it.

                                                           12

The schoolteacher quickly wades ashore, throws his
fishing rod and the net and the wriggling fish on the
gravel beside the river and climbs up the river bank.
When he gets on top, he sees the boy balancing himself
at the other end of the bridge.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Martin, be careful!
The boy takes a few more steps, then reaches the end of
the wall and jumps down onto the bridge. Hesitatingly,
he turns to the schoolteacher, who comes toward him.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Are you completely insane? ! Do
        you want to break your neck? !
        MARTIN (his head bowed): Hello, sir.
The schoolteacher has reached him.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's happening? Are you mad? !
        Don't you know how high that is?
The boy remains silent, keeping his head bent down.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Didn't you hear me? I shouted to
        you.
         MARTIN (after a short silence): Yes, I did.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?
The boy remains silent.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?!!
Keeping his head bowed, the boy shrugs a little. The
schoolteacher, realizing that this won't get him any
further, tries again, talking in a gentle voice:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: You saw me down there and wanted
        to impress me?
The boy shakes his head.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, why didn't you...
         MARTIN   (interrupting  him) I  gave  God  an
         opportunity to kill me. He didn't do it. That
         means, he's pleased with me.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (staggered): What are you saying?
         MARTIN: He doesn't want me to die.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (bewildered):   Who?   Who   doesn't
         want you to die?
         MARTIN: God.
Pause.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why would God want you to die?
The boy stops answering, his head bowed again. The
schoolteacher remains silent and looks at him for a
while. Then, he adds softly:

                                                              13

        Promise me never to do such nonsense again. All
        right? Look at me.
Martin looks up reluctantly.
        Promise it to me.
Martin remains silent. He doesn't dare look down, and
instead looks past the schoolteacher.
        You don't trust me, don't you?
        MARTIN (polite, emotionless): Yes, I do, Sir.
The schoolteacher realizes that there's no use in
talking any further.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (concluding): All right. Go home
        now. I'll be coming tomorrow for the piano
        lesson. I'll talk to your father then.
Martin turns and faces the schoolteacher, and says in
such a pleading voice that it startles him:
        MARTIN: Please, don't tell him! Please, sir,
        don't!
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why?
Martin just looks pleadingly at the schoolteacher and
shakes his head, as if to stress his request.

                            


11. SAWMILL INT/DAY
Franz, the farmer eldest son, is searching for evidence
of his mother's accident. He is accompanied by the
neighbor's son Matti, a slight boy of around 16.
The sawmill is a ramshackle wooden building beside the
river.
Matti, who obviously was there when the accident
happened, shows Franz the place.
        MATTI: There. Be careful. Everything's rotten
        here.
Franz moves slowly forward. He looks down at the lower
floor. Immediately below: the saw. Franz steps back
carefully and turns to Matti:
        FRANZ: Who made her climb up here?
       MATTI: I haven't a clue. They told us to collect
       all the lose ends. She just climbed up there.
       FRANZ: She could never stand heights. It made
       her dizzy.
       Who assigned you to this job?
       MATTI (uneasy): You know how it works. The
       sawmill needed to be cleaned up, and the foremen
       pick the weaker harvesters
                                                          14

        FRANZ: Who picked her?


                               

12. STREET AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE EXT/DAY
.
The schoolteacher with his fishing gear and several fish
that he caught.
        NARRATOR: It was on my way home after the
        strange encounter with Martin that I met Eva for
        the first time.
Eva (18), a redhead, somewhat chubby, but pretty girl,
crosses him way on her bicycle. A big bag is strapped to
the baggage carrier.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Hello.
        EVA (passing by): Hello.
The schoolteacher stops, turns to the girl:
        SCHOOLTEACHER (hesitantly): Excuse me!
        EVA (Off): Yes?
        SCHOOLTEACHER   (embarrassed):  Excuse   me   for
        accosting you this way. You're the new nanny of
        the Baron's children, aren't you?
We hear the bicycle stopping.
        EVA (o.s.): Why?
The schoolteacher has turned around and now moves toward
the girl.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: They say you're from Oberdorf.
        EVA: Who says that?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Folks around here.
        EVA: Oh. So what?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Nothing. I don't know. Sorry. I'm
        the schoolteacher here. I just thought I... I
        don't know (he laughs embarrassed): when I saw
        you, I thought... I'm from Grundbach... I'm the
        tailor's son...
        EVA: I know.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (confused): What?
        EVA: The Baroness already told me.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What did she tell you?


                                                            15

       EVA: That the schoolteacher is from the village
       next to mine.
       SCHOOLTEACHER (laughs): Oh, I see! Yes. Well...
       I thought... (he points at the bag on the
       baggage carrier): You look as if you're going
       there...
       EVA: Where?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Back home. To Oberdorf.
       EVA (doesn't understand what he's referring to):
       Yes?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Are you going there?
       EVA: Yes, I am.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (doesn't know what to say): Well,
        I thought... since you'll cycle through our
        village... you might perhaps...(he's thinking,
        looks down and sees the fish): ... say hello to
        my father and (laughing at his own idea, he
        holds up a fish) bring him one of the fishes.
        They're fresh. I just caught them.
Now Eva laughs too.
        EVA: What?!
        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling as if to apologize):
        Well. I'm sure he'd be delighted. Especially as
        it's the start of the weekend.
She nods at the fish. The absurdity of the suggestion
amuses her. At the same time she doesn't really know how
to behave.
        EVA: Well, how...
The schoolteacher holds up the fish, laughs, as if he
himself doesn't how he got this idea.
        SCHOOLTEACHER:    I     don't    know    either.
        Unfortunately, I have nothing to wrap them in.
The both laugh. Pause. Then the girl points at the bag
on the baggage carrier of her bicycle and says
regretfully:
        EVA: Neither have I. Unfortunately.
The schoolteacher has a new "idea ":
        SCHOOLTEACHER ("amused"): I could give you some
        fishing line, to tie them up.
        EVA (equally amused): There on the bicycle?!
The schoolteacher shrugs his shoulders with a smile
("why not").
        EVA: I don't think that's a very good idea.

                                                           16

         SCHOOLTEACHER:    You're   right.   It   was   just   an
         idea.
        EVA: Yes.
Embarrassed pause. Then
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that your bicycle?
         EVA ("What an idea!"): No! It belongs to the
         estate.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: I see.
Pause.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Is this your first day off?
         EVA (rather suspicious because all this is too
         intimate for her): Yes.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, you're         probably   looking
         forward to being at home.
         EVA: Yes, I am.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I can imagine.
Pause. Then
        EVA says (putting the pedals and handlebar in a
        "ready to leave" position): Well. I've still a
        long way to go.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (stepping back): Of course. Well,
         good-bye.
        EVA: Good-bye.
She's about to ride off.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (with a smile): If you cycle
        through Grundbach and see my father, at least
        say hello to him from me.
         EVA: I don't know your father.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's true.
They look at each other for a while and then Eva rides
off. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her. Eva and the bicycle are
tottering a bit. The girl looks around and shouts,
laughing:
        EVA: I only learned to ride a bicycle today!
         SCHOOLTEACHER (now o.s., also shouting): Well,
         you're doing fine! But be careful!
         As she picks up speed, Eva rides better and soon
         is just a speck on the dusty country road.
                              


                                                                    17

13. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DUSK
It's still too early to switch on the light.
Xenia and little Rudolph are sitting in the kitchen,
eating. For quite a while. Suddenly
        RUDOLPH: The woman today. What was wrong with
        her?
        XENIA (eating): Which woman? Oh, I see. She was
        dead.
Pause. Then
        RUDOLPH: What's that?
        XENIA: What?
        RUDOLPH: Dead.
Xenia looks up from her meal.
        XENIA: What's dead? My God, that's when someone
        doesn't live anymore. When he's stopped living.
SILENCE. Then
        RUDOLPH: When does one stop living?
Xenia looks up from her meal again. Now she tries to
talk more seriously to her brother because she
understands that these questions matter to him. But
she's also feeling uneasy and put on.
        XENIA: When you're too old or very ill.
        RUDOLPH: And the woman?
        XENIA: She had an accident.
        RUDOLPH: An accident?
        XENIA: Yes. That's when you hurt yourself very
        badly.
        RUDOLPH: Like Dad?
        XENIA: Yes, but much worse than that. So bad,
        that your body can't take it anymore.
        Another SILENCE: Then
        RUDOLPH: And then you're dead?
        XENIA: Yes.      But   most   people   don't   have   an
        accident.
        RUDOLPH: That means they don't need to die?
        XENIA: No, they die much later.
        RUDOLPH: When?
        XENIA: Later, when they're very old.
Long PAUSE.
                                                                   18

       RUDOLPH: Do all people die?
       XENIA: Yes.
       RUDOLPH: All of them, really?
       XENIA: Yes, everyone dies.
       RUDOLPH: But not you, Xeni?
       XENIA: Me too. Everyone.
       RUDOLPH: But not Dad?
       XENIA: Dad too.
       RUDOLPH: Me too?
       XENIA: You too. But not before a very very long
       time. All of us, only in a very long time.
       RUDOLPH: And you can't do anything against it?
       It has to happen?
        XENIA: It has to happen. But not now, not for a
        very long time.
Long PAUSE. Then
        RUDOLPH: And Mom? She didn't go on a trip?
PAUSE.
        RUDOLPH: Is she dead too?
PAUSE.
        XENIA: Yes. She's dead too. But that was a long
        time ago.
Both remain SILENT. In the meantime it has grown dark in
the kitchen.
Suddenly, Rudolph brushes away his plate off the table
with an angry movement, and turns away from Xenia. The
plate shatters on the floor.
At first Xenia is stunned, paralyzed. Then she starts to
sob, but tries to hide it from her brother.

                             

14. RECTORY. DINING ROOM. INT/NIGHT
While we hear the SOUNDS of the punishment and the
children being beaten, COUNTING the strokes with
increasing MOANS and stifled WHINING, we see (CLOSE
ANGLES) the faces of the other brothers and sisters.
Some have turned away their faces, and others start to
cry with pity and fear.
Finally both have received their 10 strokes.
CLOSE ANGLE: The pastor. He is breathless and beads of
sweat on his forehead.
        PASTOR: There.

                                                           19

He hands Martin the cane. CLOSE ANGLE: Martin.
        Here, take the cane and put it back in its
        place.
As Martin is about to go, his father goes on:
        But first you can thank me for trying to protect
        you from any further misconduct.
        CLOSE ANGLE: Marie.
        You know how much I love you and how much it
        hurts me to inflict such pain on you. Today was
        a very sad day in my life, and I hope for all of
        us that it doesn't happen again.
        CLOSE ANGLE: Both kiss their father's hand.
        CLOSE ANGLE: The pastor.
        PASTOR (smiles): And now hug me. There's nothing
        we have to forgive each other anymore. I love
        you with all my heart.
He first hugs Marie who, her face still wet with tears,
tries a forced smile and then Martin. Then, the pastor
turns to his wife:
        PASTOR: Now the ribbon, Anna.
Anna goes toward the two children, tying a white ribbon
around Martin's upper arm and another in Marie's hair.
        PASTOR: This will remain on you until we're all
        sure you have learned how to fight bad thoughts
        and manners. You're well aware, this year you
        will receive Christ's body in the form of bread
        and wine. Until then, strive to be free of
        sinful thoughts. Now let's eat.
Martin carries the cane out of the room. The pastor and
the other children sit around the table. Marie leaves
the room with her mother. After all the others have sat
down and put their plates back where they were before
the punishment, the two come back with two soup bowls
and put them on the table. Martin has also come back and
sits down at his place beside his father.
The pastor folds his hands in prayer, the others follow
suit.
        PASTOR (very friendly): Marie, would you say
        grace today?
        MARIE (smiling eagerly): With pleasure, father.
She bows her head, so do the others.
        MARIE: Come Lord Jesus and be our guest
        And bless what you've given to us.
        PASTOR: Amen. Blessed be this meal.
        THE OTHERS: Blessed be this meal.
                                                           20

The mother and Marie open the soup tureens and hand out
the soup. Then they eat.

                               

15. FARM INT/NIGHT
The body of the farmer's wife has been laid out. The
candles to its left and right are almost burnt out.
Its very quiet.
Little five-year old Sepp sneaks into the room, bare-
foot and wearing a shirt. He hesitates. Then, slowly and
carefully, he comes over to his dead mother. He ends up
standing beside the bed. The face of the dead woman is
covered with a white handkerchief.
Sepp is very frightened. He makes several attempts
before he dares to lift the handkerchief. Then he
watches her, breathless, his eyes and mouth wide open.
Suddenly, startled by a noise, he jerks back. He turns
around: his 14-year old brother Paul is sitting on a
bench against the wall. He too only wears a shirt.
        SEPP (surprised, with a whispering voice):
        Pauli?!
Paul doesn't say a word. Sepp doesn't know what to do.
He looks at his mother again, then again at his brother.
He goes over to him and sits beside him on the bench.
Like birds in a cage, they remain seated in the dark.
Very close together.

                               

16. ESTATE. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. BEDROOM.
INT/NIGHT
The steward and his children Liesl (15), Georg and
Ferdinand (10)] are waiting for something. Then the door
opens and the midwife comes out. She tells them to come
into the other room.
        NARRATOR: That night, the wife of the steward
        gave birth to her fourth and last child at the
        age of 42.
The children want to follow their father. At least
Liesl, a chubby and good-natured teenager, rather plain,
can't wait to go in. But the midwife tells them to be
patient, and only the father is let through.
        LIESL (burning with curiosity): What is it?
       MIDWIFE (smiling): Well, what do you think?
       LIESL(shakes   her   head   impatiently):   I   don't
       know.
       MIDWIFE: It's a boy.
       FERDINAND: Oh God!


                                                               21

       MIDWIFE: What do you mean?! Don't you want a
       brother?
       FERDINAND: Pff!
        MIDWIFE: You're lucky your father can't hear
        you.
Instead of the father, Georg hits his brother on the
back of the head. They quarrel.
        MIDWIFE: Stop that!
She steps in and distributes a few smacks. Liesl runs
out of the room howling.
        MIDWIFE: You should be ashamed.
        FERDINAND (Suddenly, as if he'd become another
        person): Sorry.
The midwife looks at him, confused.

                            


17. TRACK NEAR THE FARM EXT/DAWN
The farmer, Franz and Paul leave the farm, they go to
work. The two oldest carry scythes.
In the background vast fields of crops.
The three walk hurriedly. After a while
        FRANZ (hesitantly): Father, I have to tell you
        something.
       FARMER: What is it?
        FRANZ: I went to the sawmill.
The farmer keeps on walking as if he hasn't heard. Franz
looks at him from the side. For a long moment he remains
silent, while all three keep walking. Then, Franz goes
on softly:
        The floor, on the first level, where mother
        worked, was totally rotten.
They keep on walking.
        The steward, who sent her there, must have known
        it. And the landowner too.
The farmer remains silent. They keep walking.
        Father?!
       FARMER (hostile): What do you want?
        FRANZ (doesn't understand his father's refusal):
        They sent her there knowing it was dangerous.
The farmer stops, turns to Franz:
        FARMER (aggressive): What are you getting at?
       FRANZ (doesn't understand): But...
                                                           22

         FARMER (furious, but with forced calm): Do you
         want me to sue the Baron? Or kill the steward?
         FRANZ: I...
        FARMER: Go and cut off his head of with your
        scythe. Sure, that'll bring your mother back to
        life.
He turns away from Franz and keeps on walking. The
others follow. After a few steps
        FRANZ (softly): I think our father loved our
        mother.
Suddenly the farmer stops and screams, almost crying
with fury and despair:
        FARMER: Shut up!
CLOSE ANGLE: Paul. He was listening carefully the whole
time. He looks at the father. Then, lowers his eyes.
        NARRATOR: After these two days in July, life in
        the village returned to what it had always
        been...


                             


18. MONTAGE EXT/INS./DAY/NIGHT
a) Harvesting. Even teenagers and children are used to
tie the sheaves and to do other easier jobs.
        NARRATOR: ... The daily harvesting drove the
        people almost to exhaustion. Most of the
        children were busy helping their parents.

b) The midwife is doing housework in the Doctor's house.
A quarrel between her retarded son and the 4-year old
Rudolph (that we barely can follow due to the Narrator's
voice, o.s.) is settled by the midwife in favor of her
son.
        For the time being, the doctor remained in the
        hospital. In the meantime the midwife catered
        the basic needs of Xenia and Rudolph, his two
        children. After the burial of the farmer's wife,
        that was attended by the whole village, the two
        accidents were soon forgotten...


                             

19.   MANOR EXT/DAY
         NARRATOR: ... until the harvest festival at the
         end of the summer brought the whole village

                                                           23

        together again, first in a festive hustle and
        bustle, and then in horror and perplexity.

The courtyard is full of people, dressed in their Sunday
best:   Farmers,  seasonal-workers,   people  from   the
village, children and teenagers.
A dance hall has been set up. On it we see the
landowner, the steward and the pastor with their
families.
A couple of younger women, a delegation of the
harvesters, goes over to present the harvest crown to
the landowner.

        HARVESTER: ...with our songs and our prayers
        We've gathered the rye
        and given that crown to your lordship.
        It is not big, it is not small,
        But pretty, nice and fine.
        Not with thistles or thorns is it made,
        but with pure grain.
        Had our lordship sowed more,
        The men would've scythed more
        And we girls gathered more.
        We girls have gathered the grain,
        Over mountains and valleys,
        Over thistles and thorn,
        Over the fields of our lordship.
        I wish our lordship a happy life,
        As many years as there's sand on the beach
        As many years as there are drops in the rain
        So much may our lordship be blessed.
        And as a reward to be of good cheer
        We'd like for our folks a barrel of beer,
        And if we could have a fried goose perchance
        Then we'll all be ready to dance.
During the poem, the camera has shown all those we have
met until now. They have all ( except for the Doctor,
the farmer and his two eldest sons) come to the feast.
While all the folks present LAUGH and SHOUT, the maid,
with a clumsy curtsy, hands over the harvest crown to
the Baron. The village band plays a fanfare.
As soon as the hullabaloo has died down
        BARON(answering): My thanks to all of you. Thank
        you very much. You have worked well and the
        heavens were merciful, and now the barns are
        full.
         Therefore there's more than enough beer, and you
         won't starve today.
He points to the open barn, where food and beer are
waiting. In front of the barn are tables with long
benches.
         BARON: Enjoy your meal!! Eat and drink as much
         as you wish. You deserve it.
                                                            24

Again the people YELL and CHEER. Then, the MUSIC starts
and the feast is off and running.

                            


20. VEGETABLE GARDEN OF THE MANOR EXT/DAY
The vegetable garden is at the back of the manor house.
In the distance we hear the MUSIC from the feast.
Franz, in working clothes, comes over, opens a gate in
the fence, then goes to a large field with the cabbages
and slices them all off with his scythe. The whole scene
looks like a mass execution.

                            


21. ESTATE EXT/DAY
The party is in full swing: people dance and shout,
children run around, young men quarrel and show off in
front of the young girls. Older women are stand around
in groups, gossiping. Some farmers are gathered around
the landowner ­ he is friendly with them, but we don't
understand what they're talking about.
His wife, with her nervous frailty, looks out of place
in this crowd. She's talking to the schoolteacher.
        BEATRIX: ...didn't you promise us a little
        chorale sung by your protégés.
       SCHOOLTEACHER: You have to talk to the pastor,
       Baroness. We're still busy studying the choir
       pieces for the confirmation feast.
       BEATRIX (amused): But that's in spring, my dear.
       This is the start of autumn.
       SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles, embarrassed): I know, but
       unfortunately not all of our little singers are
       very musical. I'm sorry if...


                            


22. ESTATE. UNDER THE LIME TREE . EXT/DAY
A quieter part of the estate.
Under a big shadowy tree, we see the two strollers of
the landowner's family, a small table and a few chairs.
Eva is sitting beside the twins and watches the colorful
bustle. Sitting beside her, turning her back to the
manor, is Emma, the steward's wife who is breastfeeding
her baby.
The steward separates from a group of men and comes over
to the two women. As he comes over, he shouts to them:


                                                           25

        STEWARD: Well, you two "mothers"? Don't you want
        to be part of the festivities?
Eva looks at the steward's wife, not knowing, how to
react to the "mother joke". But the slightly naive wife
of the steward is basically fond of any jokes her
husband cracks. She turns halfway to him and says:
        EMMA: It's so nice here in the shade.
In the meantime the steward has come over. He's smoking
a pipe.
        STEWARD (in excellent mood): Well, our son seems
        to be enjoying that, right?!
       EMMA: Yes.
       STEWARD: I can imagine. Who wouldn't like that.
       EMMA (rebuking him gently): Georg!
       STEWARD (to Eva): What about you? Don't you get
       bored taking care of other people's children,
       with all the young lads over there?
        EVA (uneasy, with forced sweetness): No Sir, I
        love to be with the children.
He gives his wife a short glance, then sits on a chair
beside Eva:
        How old are you anyway?
       EVA: Eighteen, Sir.
       STEWARD: Eighteen! And you want me to believe
       you'd rather hold the Baroness's baby in your
       arms than your true love?
       EMMA (good-naturedly): Come on, Georg, leave her
       alone.
       STEWARD: I'm not doing her any harm. Can you get
       us something to eat, Emma?
       EVA (stands up, to Emma): If you mind the
       children for a moment, I'll get us something.
       STEWARD (stands up too): Don't worry, princess,
       I'm going. Not to panic.


                            

23. ESTATE. THE PATH LEADING TO THE VEGETABLE GARDEN.
EXT/DAY
A bunch of children between 5 and 15, dressed up in
their Sunday best, among them Marie and Martin, both
wearing  their  white  ribbons,  the  pastor's  other
                                                           26

children, Xenia, Rudolph as well as Hans, Liesl, Georg,
Ferdinand and Sigi. They leave the manor and head toward
the fields. As they pass by the vegetable garden, they
notice the sliced off cabbages and stop. Some laugh at
it, others are unsettled. Most of the children keep run
on out into the open fields.

                            


24. ESTATE. OUTSIDE THE BARN. EXT/DAY
Farmhands and tenant farmers are eating at the tables.
One of them tells a story, that we only partially
understand because of all the noise:
        FIRST TENANT FARMER: ...so the guy really tried
        to steal the rooster from the steeple. He was
        already completely pickled, but even then they
        couldn't stop him. A huge, massive guy, you see.
        So they just let him go, saying to themselves:
        if he falls down, he falls down, that's it. But
        he didn't get much farther than the first
        window, that's where the trellis ends, see. And
        even with all his strength, he couldn't hoist
        himself up on the lightning rod. So the guy
        stands up there in the window. And what do you
        think that idiot does: he starts to crow! He
        crows, shouting: I'm the rooster on the steeple.
        You'll never catch me! He made such a commotion
        that little by little the people in the
        neighborhood started to wake up...
At the same time someone else starts to shout, causing
the others to join in:

       FARMHANDS and FARMERS:
       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down, hurray!
       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down.
       Has the landlord hung himself,
       that he doesn't serve me any beer?
       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down!

Laughter. Leni, Franz's sister, and another farmgirl do
their best to cater to the drinker's thirst as fast as
possible. The two young women try to keep their spirits
up, but the guest's indelicate jokes and rude gestures
don't make it easy.

       LENI: I'm coming. I haven't got a magic wand.
       FIRST FARMHAND (with a grin): Shall I help you,
       Leni? I'd love to help you.
        SECOND FARMHAND (also grinning): What do you
        want to help her with?!
LAUGHTER.
        FIRST FARMHAND: All over. Front and backside.
                                                           27

More LAUGHTER.
        THIRD FARMHAND (to Leni): Are you as slow with
        the Baron?
         SECOND TENANT FARMER: Come on, leave her alone
         SECOND FARMHAND: You like her that much? Go and
         help her.
        FOURTH FARMHAND (sitting beside the second,
        almost in a whisper): Don't you know: it was her
        mother who had that accident?...
At the same time a boy of ten comes over to the first
farmer and butts in to his story:
        BOY: Father, they cut off the Baron's cabbages.
         FIRST TENANT FARMER: What's that?
        BOY (grin): They cut off the Baron's cabbages.
Leni, who's just putting some glasses with beer on the
table, glares at the boy, flabbergasted.

                             



25.   ESTATE. DANCE FLOOR. EXT/DAY

On the dance floor, Eva and the schoolteacher try to
dance. Neither is very talented. Eva keeps looking at
her feet and smiles, embarrassed.
        EVA: I never learned it.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (also with a smile): Neither did
        I. You just have to count out loud. One. Two.
        Three. One. Two. Three. One...
Their steps are far too big. They look clumsy and
embarrassed, but happy. After a few spins
        EVA: Aren't you afraid your students might laugh
        at you, when they see you dancing with me that
        way, sir.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (laughs): They'd better not! And
        stop being so formal with me. I'm not that old,
        am I?
Eva laughs, embarrassed and looks down.
        EVA: One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. One. Two.
        Three. One. Two. Three.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: You see: we're getting better.
         EVA: Well.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Stop looking at your feet.
                                                           28

She lifts her head, looks at him and... stumbles. They
laugh and start again.

                            


26. VEGETABLE GARDEN EXT/DAY
MUSIC of the village band can be heard coming from the
manor.
The Baroness reaches the vegetable garden, followed by
the pastor's wife, the tutor and some "ladies" from the
village. Behind the fence, among the "beheaded" cabbages
are the Baron, the steward and some farmers. A couple of
curious onlookers have gathered by the fence. Mutters,
and now and then laughter.
The Baron turns to his wife and, with a snicker, points
to the "heads" lying around him.
        BARON: Quite a job, isn't it?!
The Baroness looks at the extent of the disaster. Then
says, revolted:
        BARONESS: This is disgusting.
The steward comes over to them and, with a little grin,
comments on the sensitivity of his masters:
        STEWARD: It used to be an old custom (he
        quotes):
        "Now that the harvesting's done,
        "It's time to pay us, every one,
        "Any miser who leaves us in a rut,
        "He shall have his cabbage cut.

The Baroness, who doesn't think the symbolic character
of the deed is funny at all, looks briefly at him and
then back again at the cabbage cemetery. Suddenly, she
turns away and leaves the scene headed toward the manor.
She makes her way through the bystanders, who step aside
to let her through.

                            


27. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DUSK
The pastor works at his desk. Suddenly a KNOCK on the
door
        PASTOR (looking up): Come in
Florian comes hesitantly through the door.
        PASTOR: What do you want?
       FLORIAN (shy, almost frightened): I'd like to
       ask you something, Father.
       PASTOR: Yes?


                                                           29

The boy comes over to the desk, opens a few buttons of
his shirt and then seizes something inside. In the open
shirt we see the head of a little bird.
        PASTOR: So what?
        FLORIAN: I have found it. It's wounded.
Short PAUSE.
        PASTOR: What do you want?
         FLORIAN (pleadingly): May I keep it?
Short pause. The pastor is moved by the request of his
youngest    son,  but   manages  to   hide   his emotion
skillfully.
         PASTOR: How do you plan to do that?
       FLORIAN: We'll heal it.
        PASTOR (softly): And when it's healed?
Florian looks at him with round eyes, he doesn't know
what to answer. The pastor continues:
        Don't you think, you'll be attached to it then?
        Will you let it fly away?
Florian thinks, then nods toward a cage behind the desk.
        FLORIAN: "Pipsi" also lives in a cage.
The pastor looks at the cage shortly, hides a smile and
turns to Florian again:

        PASTOR: Yes, but Pipsi grew up in captivity.
        (nodding at Florian's bird): This one is used to
        living in freedom.
Florian doesn't know what to answer. So he merely looks
at his father with pleading eyes.
        PASTOR (repeats): Will you set him free, as soon
        he's healed?
Florian, looks down and nods with a heavy heart.
        PASTOR: Have you already asked Mother?
Florian nods eagerly.
        PASTOR: And? What did she say?
       FLORIAN: She said, it was for Father to decide.
        PASTOR (smiling faintly): That's what she said?
Florian nods eagerly and looks at his father with eyes
that are pleading with expectation.
        PASTOR: You'll really to take care of it? That's
        a heavy responsibility. You know that, don't
        you?
Sensing that his father is not quite against it, Florian
nods eagerly.
                                                           30

        PASTOR: Well. You're its father and mother now.
Florian nods yet more eagerly, if that's possible. The
pastor finds it difficult not to smile:
        We'll have to find a cage for your patient.
Florian can hardly believe it. He'd like to fling his
arms around his father's neck, but doesn't dare. So he
just keeps standing there, beaming.
        FLORIAN: Thanks, Father!

                            



28. TRACK TO THE FARM EXT/DUSK
Leni comes along the track, excited. She`s almost
running. She reaches the farm and disappears inside.

                            

29. FARM. ROOM. INT/DUSK
The family is eating. They're in working clothes, since
they didn't attend the Thanksgiving feast. Only Leni,
who visibly just came into the room, is still wearing
the clothes she wore at the feast. She's out of breath
and very excited. The farmer looks very concerned.
        FARMER (to Franz): Is that true?
       FRANZ (hostile, keeps on eating): I don't know
       nothing.
       FARMER (threatening): Is ­ that - true?!
       FRANZ (looks at him, aggressively): Nothing is
       true! And even if it was true, so what?! Serves
       him right, that miser!
        FARMER (trying to control himself): Did you do
        it, or did you not do it?
Franz doesn't answer and keeps on eating.
        LENI: It seems somebody saw you.
For a moment Franz remains calm, then he bursts out:
        FRANZ (to Leni): So what? They should be glad
        that they still have their own heads.(to the
        farmer) And I want you to know this, Father: I'm
        proud of it!
The father responds to this by slapping his face hard.
Franz jumps up.
        FARMER (orders Franz without looking at him):
        Sit down!
For a moment, we don't know how Franz will behave.
Sitting on the corner bench, he's jammed between his
                                                           31

father and his brothers and sisters, who stare at the
table, embarrassed. Only Paul, who sits opposite his
brother, looks up at him.
Franz finally sits down again. SILENCE. The farmer
stares at his plate, tries to speak softly, which is
obviously difficult for him, to judge by the sound of
his voice.
        FARMER: What did you intend to do?
As Franz doesn't answer, he looks up, right into Franz's
face, who avoids his father's eyes.
        FARMER: Well?
        FARMER: Tell me.
Franz keeps on glaring straight ahead. The farmer adopts
a gentler tone.
        Come on. Tell me:
       FRANZ (who   can   hardly   speak):   You   know   why,
       Father.
        FARMER (after a pause): Because of your mother?
        Because you feel they're responsible for her
        death? Is that it? What do you think? That I'm
        not man enough to settle this? It's that what
        you think?
Franz keeps on glaring, remaining silent. The father
tries to stay calm, staring straight ahead. He takes a
spoon and eats twice from the milk soup. He puts down
the spoon, and looks at Franz again.


       Did you ever think of what your behavior can
       mean for the whole family? If Leni loses her
       job, which enables us to keep our heads above
       water for the whole year? What if we can't work
       there anymore during the summer?

Franz makes an impatient movement, takes raises            his
spoon and wants to go on eating. The farmer grabs          his
arm and slams it down. The two stare at each other.        For
a moment, we don't know what will happen. Then             the
farmer goes on:


       You want to marry and take over the farm in two
       years? Yes? And how will you feed them all (he
       points with his head at the other children)
       without the help of the manor, tell me?

Franz turns his head away. He disagrees, but does not
know what to answer. The farmer goes on:


                                                                 32

        And how do you know they're responsible?

Franz turns to him abruptly:
        FRANZ: And how do you know they're innocent?
The farmer looks at Franz with round eyes. A long PAUSE
follows. Then the

        FARMER says (quietly): I don't know.

And after another PAUSE.

        FARMER: But I don't know the opposite either.
                                



30. MANOR. STAIRWELL. INT/NIGHT
The Baron stands at the bottom and shouts up at the
tutor who's standing on the stairs:
        BARON:...What do you mean "not there"?
        TUTOR   (sheepish):   He...  disappeared.    I`ve
        already looked everywhere. I can't find him.
        BARON: Nonsense. He can't have vanished     into
        thin air. When did you see him last?
        TUTOR (as above): Around 2 o'clock.
        BARON (his anger mounting): Around two? Do you
        know what time it is?!
        TUTOR (guiltily): I know, Sir.
Furious, the landowner turns away from the nincompoop,
pensive. Then he turns to the TUTOR again:
        BARON: What does my wife say, doesn't she have
        any clue?
        TUTOR: Madame sent me to you,     Baron. She is
        beside herself with fear.
        BARON (wryly): I can imagine.(looks up to the
        tutor): You're an idiot, Huber. Why do you think
        you're here? To take care of a single child! Is
        that such a hard task?
        TUTOR (softly): I'm awfully sorry, Baron.
        BARON: You're even too stupid for that.
The Baron turns away and heads for the door. Then he
turns around again and asks:


                                                            33

       BARON: Where did you see my son for the last
       time?
       TUTOR: Outside, in the courtyard. He said, he
       was going to play with the other children.
       BARON: Where?
       TUTOR: That he didn't say.
       BARON: And      my   wife   didn't   notice   anything
       either?
       TUTOR: After that business with the cabbage
       heads, Madame retired to her room. She was
       indisposed.
       BARON (sarcastically): Indisposed?!
       TUTOR: Yes. She had a terrible migraine attack.
        BARON (almost to himself): My God, this place is
        a zoo!
He turns away and goes out into the courtyard. The tutor
follow him with his eyes. He feels he's being badly
treated and hates the Baron for his insults. Finally he
goes back up the stairs.

                               



31. MANOR. EXT/NIGHT
BACK TO THE SCENE.
The torches of the feast have almost burned out. Here
and there we see some lanterns, put there to facilitate
the cleaning up.
Coming from the front door, the Baron crosses the vast
courtyard. Half way across he screams:
        BARON: Bräker!!
The steward is overseeing a dozen farmhands, who are
putting the tables and the benches of the feast back the
barn. He walks toward the Baron.
        BARON. Have you seen my son?
       STEWARD (surprised): No.
       BARON (quietly): Could you please ask your boys.
       Apparently, Sigi has disappeared with a whole
       bunch of kids.
       STEWARD:    Immediately.   (shouting    to   the
       farmhands): When you're finished with the
       cleaning up, wait for me. There's still a job to
       do. Get some fresh torches and lanterns!
       BARON: In the meantime I'll go round up the men.
                                                                34

The steward goes to his house, the Baron         to   the
outbuildings. There, he switches on the SIREN.

        NARRATOR: The steward's children said, they had
        seen Sigi only for a short time, that he had
        gone off with other kids, and that they didn't
        pay much attention to it...
                                


32. MONTAGE EXT/INT/NIGHT
IN THE COURTYARD.
Many men of different ages with lanterns and torches.
The Baron makes a short speech and the steward assigns
the areas to be searched. Most of this is drowned out by
the narrator's voice.

        NARRATOR: ...The search began shortly after
        midnight. Before, the Baron had ridden to the
        Rectory. But there he found out nothing new from
        the children who had been specially woken up.


STABLE AND OUTBUILDINGS OF THE ESTATE.
VARIOUS LANDSCAPES: FOREST, FIELD, RIVER MEADOWS.
The search.
        The searchers, who were tired and some of whom
        were still drunk, were divided into two groups:
        one group started to search all the buildings on
        the estate, one by one, while the others combed
        the surrounding areas.
        It was around half past two, when some members
        of the search party had already preferred to lie
        down   somewhere   and   to   sleep  off   their
        drunkenness, that the siren suddenly sounded
        again, calling the men back to the courtyard...
IN THE COURTYARD.
The men come in with a stretcher.
        ...They had found Sigi. He had been tied up in
        the old sawmill, upside down. His trousers had
        been pulled down and his buttocks were bleeding
        from cane strokes. He seemed to be in a state of
        shock, was unable to walk and had to be brought
        back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher,
        lying on his belly.
                                


33. CHURCH INT/DAY
The room is packed. The whole village is gathered.
                                                            35

        NARRATOR: The next Sunday, the Baron, at the end
        of the service, asked the pastor if he could say
        a few words:

        BARON: You all know now what was done to my son
        Siegmund. Policemen from the district town were
        here this week. They questioned many of you. But
        to no avail. First I thought that the people who
        tortured my child were the same people who cut
        off my family's "cabbage heads"...

Unrest in the attendance.


        ...because they wanted to "get even". Get even
        for what? Because their mother had died while
        she was working in the sawmill, and it was
        supposedly  my  fault,   which  is  an  absurd
        assertion.

The farmer, Leni and the other children are there, with
the exception of Franz.

The unrest grows.


        At least, that's what Franz Felder gave as the
        motive for his "mowing prowess", when the
        policemen arrested him. I have always supported
        the farmer Felder and his family, but one can't
        always expect people to be grateful. That's a
        matter of character.

The farmer wants to leave the church.

        BARON: Don't run away, Felder. It's your honor I
        want to salvage.
        It has turned out that the valiant Franz Felder
        has been boasting of his feat in front of his
        fiancée. Then the coward that he is, hid among
        his family, and so he didn't have time to
        torture my son. And there's one thing I know for
        sure: the senior Felder would rather bite off
        his tongue, than cover for his wayward son. May
        I remind you something what most of you have
        already forgotten. Almost two months ago, the
        doctor had a riding accident and he has still
        not returned from the hospital. This accident
        was caused by a wire that had been strung in his
        garden with the explicit intent of bringing him
        down. And in that case too, nobody knows
        anything, saw anything or heard anything.

                                                           36

Disconcerted MUTTER among the attendance.


        We all know that the people responsible for the
        terrible injuries suffered by my son, and those
        suffered by the doctor are sitting here among
        us, in this room. I won't tolerate that crimes
        of this nature go unpunished. I don't wish
        something similar to happen to any of your
        children. That's why I call upon you all to help
        me find the culprit or the culprits. Ask
        questions, keep your ears open, be watchful. If
        we fail to find out the truth, the peace within
        our community will be gone. Thank you, pastor.

The pastor says a few last words which we don't grasp,
that the narrator's voice drowns out. The people file
out of the church, quietly and slowly, but talking
worriedly to each other.

        NARRATOR: The landowner's speech frightened the
        people. Most knew about the incident at the
        Thanksgiving feast. But the majority didn't know
        exactly what had happened, and in the end they
        didn't care. The Baron was not really popular
        among the people, but he was respected as a
        powerful social figure, as well as the employer
        of nearly the whole village.
                                

34. IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH EXT/DAY
BACK TO THE SCENE.
The people are leaving the church, groups are forming.
As the farmer Felder and his children come out, they're
shunned.
Gauntlet down the village street. The CAMERA follows.
         NARRATOR: ...His threat about loosing the peace
         of the community couldn't mean anything good.
        At the same time the mysterious character of
        what were obviously criminal deeds fed the
        mistrust of the farmers, deeply rooted since
        time immemorial.
                            

35. SCHOOL. INT/NIGHT
The empty classroom. On the harmonium: a petroleum lamp.
The schoolteacher is PLAYING.
After a while, someone knocks at the door. The
schoolteacher stops.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (surprised): Come in!
                                                           37

The door opens hesitantly. In the dark: Eva (hardly
recognizable because she's so far from the lamp).

        SCHOOLTEACHER (surprised and glad): Eva!
        EVA (hardly understandable): May I come in?
The Schoolteacher stands up, goes toward and, laughing
with surprise, says to her.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: What a question. Of course. Come
        in. What happened.


Eva enters the room and closes the door behind her.
She's carrying a suitcase. Shyly she looks around and
doesn't say a word.

        SCHOOLTEACHER:   Come   over   here.   It's   so   dark.
        Come on.

He moves toward the lamp and waits half-way because she
doesn't follow.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's going on?

        EVA: They fired me.

        SCHOOLTEACHER (startled): What do you mean?

She shrugs her shoulders.

        EVA: Nothing. They just threw me out (pause,
        then) The tutor has also been fired.


Suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, she bursts into
floods of tears. At the same time she turns away from
the schoolteacher. He goes over to her, and stops in
front of her, but is too shy to touch her. Suddenly she
turns to him again and says, sobbing:

        I don't know where to go. I can't go back home
        in the middle of the night. I'm afraid to walk
        on the road all alone.

        SCHOOLTEACHER (calming her down): Don't worry.
        Try to calm down. There's nothing to worry
        about.


                                                                   38

        EVA (sobbing, childish): There is.


        SCHOOLTEACHER (with a calming smile): Come here
        and sit down. Please calm down and then tell me
        what happened. All right?

She's sits down on the school bench beside her. The
schoolteacher sits on his haunches in front of her:

        Well?!

It takes her time to calm down.

        What happened?


Slowly she manages to calm down, breathes deeply a few
times. The schoolteacher is visibly charmed by her
childish despair.

        EVA: The son of the Baron isn't at all well. His
        parents are angry and desperate. Now they say
        that it's the tutor's and my fault, because we
        didn't pay enough attention to him. But I'm only
        there for the twins.

She starts to sob again:

        I've always taken care of them very well. When
        you and I were dancing, the Baroness had given
        me permission. I haven't done anything wrong,
        really.


        SCHOOLTEACHER: I know, come on. Stop crying!

        EVA: Where shall I go now? We need the money I
        was earning here.

        SCHOOLTEACHER:   You'll  find   something  else.
        Besides, you know very well that the Baron is
        quick-tempered. With him, nothing is ever as bad
        as it seems.

        EVA (fiercely shaking her head):No, no, that's
        all over now, I know it. The Baroness doesn't
        want to see anyone. She wants to take the
        children with her to town or to her parent's
        estate ­ I don't know exactly.
                                                           39

        SCHOOLTEACHER: (after a pause): I'll try to talk
        to her. A while back, we played music together.
        (with a smile): Unfortunately, I wasn't very
        good. Now she's got the tutor, he plays better.
        As far as I know, he's been studying music in
        town.


        EVA (forgetting her grief a bit): He doesn't
        play that well.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's true.

        EVA (after a pause, serious again): Who could
        have done such things?

        SCHOOLTEACHER: What?

        EVA: To beat a child that way.


        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know.

Long PAUSE. Then she says softly:

        EVA: Can I stay here tonight?         Don't send me
        away, sir, please.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: How can you think something like
        that?

        EVA: I'll just wait for the daylight to come.
        Here in the classroom. Then I'll leave.


Suddenly she starts to cry again:

        They won't understand this,      at   home.   They'll
        think I did something wrong.

PAUSE. Then the

        SCHOOLTEACHER: Do you want me to come with you.

She stops crying and looks at him, surprised.

                                                                40

        EVA: What did you say?

        SCHOOLTEACHER    (cheerful):   Tomorrow,   after
        school? I can try to find us a carriage. I'll be
        back by evening.

        EVA: And why should you do that, Sir.


        SCHOOLTEACHER: Stop being so formal.


        EVA (after a break): Why should you do this?


PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher stands up and says:

        SCHOOLTEACHER: Come here, I'll play something
        for you. If you'd like that.

She thinks for a moment, then she nods eagerly. She
follows him, as he goes and settles in front of the
harmonium. She sits on a bench nearby. He starts to
PLAY.

                                      

36. FARM. PIGSTY. INT/EXT/DAY
The farmer and Paul are cleaning the pigsty which is not
very big. The pigs grunt excitedly because of the
disturbance.
Suddenly, Franz enters.
         FRANZ: Good morning, Father.
The farmer looks up, keeps on working as if nobody had
come in.
Paul greets Franz with a nod, remaining silent.
After a while, they've done their work. Ignoring Franz,
the farmer goes outside.
Franz, who has stepped aside to let his father by, says
to him as he goes out:
         FRANZ: I'm back again. They set me free.
At this, the farmer stops and turns around. He looks
Franz right into the eyes:
         FARMER: I can see that. So what?
Franz bows his head. Paul, who has followed his father,
out of the pigsty, glances surreptitiously at his
brother. The farmer goes over to the fountain and washes
himself. Franz follows him slowly and stops beside his
father, who keeps ignoring him. After a while

                                                           41

        FRANZ says (softly): Can't you forgive me,
        Father?
The farmer stops washing and turns to Franz:
        FARMER: What do you want me to forgive for? That
        the estate won't give me any work now? That Leni
        has been fired in disgrace? That your brothers
        and sisters soon won't have anything to eat. Is
        that what you mean? Or is it something else?


                            

37. COUNTRY ROAD AND DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY
The CAMERA follows the carriage in which are Eva and the
schoolteacher.
        NARRATOR: The next day, after school, I went to
        the estate to inquire about Sigi's health and to
        intercede for Eva's reinstatement. We were told
        the Baroness had left that morning with her
        children. Reluctantly, the steward lent me a
        carriage to take Eva home.
An open carriage with the Doctor inside comes from the
opposite direction. The passengers of the two carriages
greet each other. The CAMERA follows the Doctor and
looses Eva and the schoolteacher.
The doctor has one arm in a sling.
The Doctor's carriage ends up turning into his property.
The driver helps the doctor get out. Xenia comes running
out of the house and greets her father. The driver
unloads the luggage. The doctor and Xenia go into the
house.

       Just as we were leaving the village, we met the
       doctor.
       A few days after the Thanksgiving feast,
       Rudolph, his four year old son, had suddenly
       disappeared. Of course, everybody was terribly
       upset in view of all the previous occurrences.
       Finally, he was found walking down the road,
       scantily dressed for a trip, headed eagerly
       toward the town. When he was asked where he was
       going, he said he wanted to visit his father.
       Seems he fought tooth and nail against being
       taken home.
       Somebody must have told this to the Doctor.
       Since he was scheduled to be released from
       medical care anyway, he had prematurely put an
       end to his stay at the hospital.

                            


                                                           42

38. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DAY
BACK TO THE SCENE.
STAIRWELL.
        DOCTOR (calls several times): Rudi?
He throws an ironical inquiring look at Xenia. Xenia
shrugs her shoulders, clueless:

        XENIA: He was in the living room a short time
        ago.

Just as they're about to go to the living room, the
driver comes in with the luggage. The Doctor thanks him
and pays him. The driver leaves. Xenia has been waiting
in the doorway. Now they go together into the

LIVING ROOM
There's nobody. They go into the kitchen
KITCHEN. Nobody. The look under the kitchen table, in
the pantry. Nobody.

         DOCTOR: Rudi? Where are you?
Again the
STAIRWELL. The doctor doesn't know whether to be angry
or to laugh about the whole matter. He goes to his
wardrobe to take his off his jacket. Because of the
sling, Xenia has to help him. That's when she notices
the toilet. She tells her father with a smile. As Xenia
hangs up the doctor's jacket, he goes to the toilet door
and tries to open it. It's locked. The Doctor stops in
front of it.
         DOCTOR (quiet): Hello, Rudi. Don't you want to
         say hello to your father? No?
PAUSE:
         I heard you even wanted to visit me at the
         hospital. And now you lock yourself in?
PAUSE. The doctor looks shortly at Xenia who's carrying
the luggage upstairs. Then he keeps on talking to
Rudolph:
         All right. Then, I don't want to see you either.
         I'm going away now. You can stay in the toilet,
         if you want.
He goes down the few steps to the entrance, waits a
moment and then leaves the house.


                                



39. PROPERTY THE DOCTOR'S EXT/DAY
BACK TO THE scene.
                                                            43

The doctor steps out of the door, and wanders through
the garden. He goes over to the trees, where the wire
had been strung. He examines the traces of the wire on
the bark. He lights a cigar, then looks out at the mowed
fields.
After a while Xenia comes over to him. He glances at
her, then again at the fields. Both remain silent. After
a while
        XENIA   says:  Everything  is   ready  in   your
        practice.   Mrs.   Wagner  prepared   everything
        yesterday.

PAUSE then

        DOCTOR: Why do you tell me that?

Xenia looks at him, surprised, shrugs her shoulders.
        XENIA: I don't know. I just thought you might
        want to know.
PAUSE.
        DOCTOR: Has she taken good care of you?
        XENIA: Yes.
PAUSE. The doctor turns to Xenia:
        DOCTOR: How old are you now?
        XENIA: Fourteen.
The doctor looks at her, laughs silently and shakes his
head. Again he looks out on the fields. After a while he
says:
        DOCTOR: It's amazing how much you look like your
        mother.
Xenia remains silent. Suddenly she whispers:

        XENIA: Dad.

The doctor turns to her. She nods toward the house. The
doctor follows her look. Indeed Rudolph, who from here
looks even smaller than he really is, has stepped
gingerly out of the door. Unsure and undecided, torn
between defiance and longing, he's kept one hand on the
door handle that he can barely reach.


                            

40. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/NIGHT
The pastor cleans the cage of the small bird behind the
desk and feeds the animal. As he does it, he talks to

                                                           44

Martin, who, the white ribbon still tied around his
upper arm, stands in front of the desk.
        PASTOR: Your mother and I are deeply worried
        about you. Think about it. Are you sleeping
        badly? Are you overtired?
       MARTIN   (as   if   he   didn't   understand   the
       question): No.
       PASTOR: Do you have problems in school that I
       don't know?
        MARTIN (as above): No, Father.
The pastor turns shortly around to his son, looks at
him, then turns again to the bird.

       PASTOR: You probably don't understand why we
       worry. It comes from a sad experience I want to
       tell you briefly about:
       As you know, I'm also acting as pastor for the
       communities of Birkenbrunn and Hebern. In the
       latter place, some years ago, a mother came to
       see me. She had noticed that her son, who was
       about the same age as you, and had the same
       symptoms that you've been showing for some time.
       Although until then the boy had been healthy and
       active,   suddenly   he  showed   a   noticeable
       weariness, he had dark rings under the eyes,
       seemed depressed and joyless. The boy had also
       changed emotionally: before he had been funny,
       frank, almost naughty, but now he became
       withdrawn. He tried not to look his parents in
       the eye, and was caught telling small and even
       big lies.

The pastor has finished the cleaning and feeding, and
now sits down behind his desk, Martin opposite him:
        That lasted approximately half a year. Then
        everything went very fast: he lost his appetite,
        couldn't sleep any more, his whole face took on
        the brownish color of the rings under his eyes,
        his hands began to shake, his memory stated to
        fail him, he was covered with numerous small
        pustules, first on his face, then on his whole
        body and finally he died. The body, which I
        blessed, looked like the body of an old man.
The pastor watches Martin:
        PASTOR: Do you understand now why I'm worried?
Martin reacts with a timid nod of his head.
        PASTOR: So, according to you: what caused these
        changes that led to the miserable end of this
        boy?
       MARTIN (hardly able to speak): I don't know.
                                                            45

        PASTOR: I think you know well.
Martin doesn't know what to say, he looks down. The
pastor watches him for a long moment, then he gets up,
walks around the desk and sits down on its edge, in
front of the boy, so that their heads are facing each
other.

        Won't you tell me? No?
        Then I'll tell you what the cause was: The boy
        had learned from someone, who had harmed the
        finest nerves of his body, in the area where
        God's will has erected sacred barriers. The boy
        imitated this action. He couldn't stop doing it,
        so that at the end he destroyed all the nerves
        in his body, and so much that he died of it.

Martin seems very affected. He has bowed his head,
swallows several times, and hardly dares to breath.
        Look at me, Martin.
Martin looks up fearfully, then immediately looks away
again.
        I just want to help you. I love you with all my
        heart. Look at me.
Martin looks his father in the eyes.
        Be sincere, Martin. Why did you blush and become
        so nervous when I told you the story of the poor
        boy.
        MARTIN: Blushed? I don't know... I felt sorry
        for him.
        PASTOR: Is that all?
        No, Martin, there has to be another reason. It's
        written on your face.
        Be sincere, Martin. Sincerity brings you closer
        to God, our beloved Father, and to all human
        beings.
        MARTIN (starts to cry): Oh, my God!
He cries in a such pitiful way that even the pastor has
tears in his eyes. He embraces the boy. The latter
seizes the hand of his father and kisses it intensely.
        PASTOR: Well, Martin, why are you crying? Shall
        I spare you that confession? You too have done
        what that wretched boy did, haven't you?
        MARTIN (crying): Oh my God! Yes.
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
                            




                                                           46

41. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. INT/NIGHT
Intercourse between the midwife and the doctor. She
holds on to the sideboard, as he penetrates her from
behind. Both are fully dressed, she has just lifted her
skirt.
When he is ready, she turns around and puts her arms
around him. He lets her do it, with a patronizing smile
and pulls gently away from her.
        DOCTOR: Careful, my arm.
She tries to hide her frustration, sits down again with
him at the table, on which are the leftovers of their
meal. With a little ironic smile, the doctor raises his
glass to her. She takes her glass and clinks it with
his. She drinks. An embarrassed silence follows.
Finally, she says
        MIDWIFE: It's great that you're back. It was
        about time.
         DOCTOR: You can say that. Yes.
PAUSE.
         MIDWIFE: It was   difficult    with    the    children,
         without you.
         DOCTOR: I know.
         MIDWIFE: He doesn't like me.
         DOCTOR: Who?
         MIDWIFE: Rudi.
         DOCTOR (after a pause): He's at a difficult age.
        MIDWIFE: Actually not.
PAUSE. Then:
        They're always at a difficult age.
        DOCTOR (more to himself, with a faint smile):
        Yes.
LONG PAUSE.
        MIDWIFE: You didn't miss me.
         DOCTOR: Come on. What are you saying?!
         MIDWIFE: Nothing. I said it because it's the
         truth.
PAUSE.
         DOCTOR: There's   nothing   like   a   nice    dose   of
         self-hate.
         MIDWIFE: What?
         DOCTOR: Nothing. Forget it.

                                                                    47

After a pause, she reaches over the table, takes his
hand, puts her cheek against it. He lets her do it, then
takes his hand from under her head and strokes her hair.

                            



42. CHURCH EXT/DAY
It's snowing. From the inside of the church, we hear the
children's choir:
CHILDREN (singing in harmony):

        ...us free from all misery,
        That has hit us now.
        That old evil enemy,
        Is serious about it,
        Great power and much deceit
        Are his cruel armor,
        No one on earth resembles him...*

Over this:

        NARRATOR: Winter came early that year. At the
        Reformation feast on the first Sunday of
        November, a deep blanket of snow covered the
        village.
        The Baron, who had come back without his family,
        didn't attend, which was very unusual for him...

                            



43. CHURCH INT/DAY
IMMEDIATE BACK TO THE scene.
The community celebrates the Reformation Feast.
The schoolteacher conducts the children's choir. The
children sing enthusiastically. Marie and Martin wear
the white ribbon on their arm.

        NARRATOR: ...The villagers took that as a sign
        of his anger. Indeed, no evidence had been found
        as to the possible author of the crime, although
        the Baron's appeal had led to a flood of mutual
        suspicions,   even    to   some    attempts   of
        denunciation that had all turned out to be
        untenable.


                                




                                                           48

44. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE. INT/NIGHT
The doctor examines the steward's baby that is crying.
Finally, he turns to the parents.
        DOCTOR: Well, it's not pneumonia. But you must
        be careful. If his temperature rises, call me
        again. For the time being you must give these
        drops every two hours. And hang some wet sheets
        over the oven. That facilitates breathing.
While the mother puts the child back in the cradle, the
doctor and the father go down the STAIRWAY to the LIVING
ROOM.
        How long has the window been open?
       STEWARD: Difficult to say. My wife nursed him at
       about one o'clock. When she came back, it was
       around half past two. At that time it was icy
       cold in this room.
       DOCTOR: And the baby didn't cry?
        STEWARD: No. The children were upstairs and
        didn't hear anything either.
They have reached the living room where Liesl, Georg and
Ferdinand get up as he comes in.
        DOCTOR (to the children): He's doing all right,
        considering the circumstances. We have to wait.
The children seem worried. To calm them the doctor adds:
        For now we'll have to wait.
The steward has gone to the sideboard.
        STEWARD: Can I offer you something to warm you
        up?
       DOCTOR: No, thanks. I'm overloaded with work.
       When one has been away for so long...
        STEWARD: Georg!
At a sign of the father, Georg jumps up and gets the
doctor's coat and hat from outside. In the meantime, the
father keeps on chatting with the doctor:
        And how is your arm doing?
       DOCTOR: It's all right. Everything will be fine
       in two or three weeks.
        STEWARD: That must be terrible, I imagine. You
        probably feel like half a man when you can't use
        your arm properly.
Georg has come back with the hat and the coat, and hands
them to the doctor,
        DOCTOR: Thank you.
The steward helps him with his coat because of his bad
arm.
                                                           49

         DOCTOR (laughs): Quod erat demonstrandum. Thank
         you. Well, good night, children.
         CHILDREN: Good night, Doctor.
        DOCTOR (to the steward who holds the door open):
        Thank you. If your wife thinks that the baby...
The steward closes the door to the stairwell, so that we
can't grasp the rest of their conversation.
The children are alone. They remain silent. Then
        FERDINAND: Well...
         GEORG: What do you mean "well"?
         FERDINAND ("dumb question,      it's   obvious"):   I
         mean! That's fine.
PAUSE.
         LIESL (to Ferdinand): When did you go down to
         see Father? Down in his office.
         FERDINAND: Why?
         LIESL: Just asking.


                              



45. SNOW-COVERED COUNTRY ROAD EXT/DAY
The schoolteacher, a rucksack on his back, walks through
the snow which is only furrowed by some carriage tracks.

         NARRATOR: In mid-December, I finally got a
         letter from Eva. Her father had found her a new
         job in the district capital, which she would
         start at the beginning of the New Year.
         Since that night, where she had come looking for
         shelter in the school and we had tried to tell
         each other the story of our short lives until
         the wee hours of the morning, I could no longer
         banish from my thoughts her pale face, her shy
         but frank personality and her shining hair red.
         The school holidays lasted until the morning
         after New Year's Day, but already the second day
         after Christmas ­ the weather was cold but sunny
         ­ I went on my way to Obersdorf in order to
         visit Eva and her parents.


                              


                                                                 50

46. THE HORSE-TRADER'S LIVING-ROOM INT/DAY
A lower middle-class room.
The schoolteacher sits in front of Eva and her siblings,
6 children between 14 and 6, mostly red-haired like Eva.
Embarrassed silence. The younger children whisper and
giggle. The conversation is slow. After a long pause
        EVA says: And Sigi?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. The Baroness isn't
        back yet.
        EVA: And the Baron?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (shrugs): We hardly see him. He
        talks to nobody. I don't know. Some say they've
        gone to the south. To Italy.
        EVA: To Italy? Really.
PAUSE.   The   children    giggle,   amused   over    the
embarrassment of the two people.
The schoolteacher and Eva look at each other, but Eva
soon averts her eyes.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: They now want to tear down the
        sawmill for good. That's what the steward says.
        Because it isn't worthwhile to...
At that moment the door opens and Eva's parents come in.
Obviously, the mother went to fetch the father. She is
plump, in her late forties and only wears a woolen shawl
over her shoulders. The father wears a hat and overcoat.
He's a sturdy man in his early fifties, of peasant
stock. He probably came straight from a tavern, and
appears to be slightly drunk. The schoolteacher, Eva and
the children stand up. The schoolteacher bows deeply:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good morning.
        FATHER: Good morning, young man.
They shake hands.
        FATHER: Please be seated. We're not very formal
        here.
With a short movement of his hand the father invites him
to sit down.
        FATHER (to the children): Scram!
The children, rather sheepish since the arrival of their
father, leave the room. The father unbuttons his over
coat, throws the hat on the sofa and sits down. The
mother has removed her shawl and asks the schoolteacher:
        MOTHER: Would you like something to drink?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: No, thank you. Very kind.
        MOTHER: Really?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Really. Thank you very much.
                                                            51

The father sits      down beside Eva and looks at the
schoolteacher. Eva    appears to be awkward, and stares at
the table in front   of her.
        FATHER: So   you're a schoolteacher.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes.
        FATHER: Can you afford to have a wife?
Short embarrassed PAUSE.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: My father works as a tailor in
        Grundbach. I have an apprentice's diploma. So I
        earn quite a bit on the side
         FATHER: You should have taken over your father's
         business, that would have been smarter.
PAUSE.
         Well. And why are you so focused on that girl?
         She's almost still a child. You could almost be
         her father.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles): I'm thirty-one.
         FATHER (grinning): Well, you can still handle
         what matters.
        MOTHER (embarrassed): Father!
Eva and the schoolteacher don't know where to look.
        FATHER: Let's be serious: do you know whether
        she's willing to get married. She's still a
        child. She hasn't seen anything of the world.
        To Eva: Say something. Do you want him?
Eva wishes the earth would engulf her.
        FATHER: Come on. Don't make such a fuss. He
        walked all the way over through the fresh snow.
         MOTHER: Why don't you leave her alone.         Of
         course, she wants him. Can't you feel that?!
        FATHER: How can I? If she keeps her mouth shut!
Eva jumps up and runs out, so as not to burst into tears
out of shame.
The mother follows her, shaking her head disapprovingly
at the father. The schoolteacher stands up, as Eva ran
out. He'd rather follow her, but has to remain polite
toward the father. The father says calmly:

         FATHER: Just sit down. That's how women are. A
         bit hysterical, the whole lot of them. Listen.
         I'm not a big talker. On one hand, it suits me
         for the girl to leave the house. We have a lot
         of mouths to feed, as you can see.


                                                             52

         On the other hand, it's all moving a bit too
         fast for me. I don't know you. It's not that I
         don't like you, but I need to get some
         information about you first. Besides, the town
         hairdresser has agreed to take her on as an
         apprentice.
         That way she'll get to meet people and she can
         make up he mind whether she really wants this or
         not. And if in a year's time she has stuck to
         this idea, we can l talk about it again. And you
         can make up your mind too, all right?
         SCHOOLTEACHER: I actually thought I...
         FATHER (interrupts him): I know, I know. But
         it's either that or nothing. You get it?
         SCHOOLTEACHER (after a short pause) steps back:
         If you insist...
        FATHER: Yes, I do.
He holds out his hand to the schoolteacher, who accepts
it after a brief hesitation.
        FATHER: That's it. I'm pleased. Well, business
        is waiting. Even on holidays. I'll send the girl
        back in so that you can say good-bye. A year
        goes by fast. The world won't collapse. And
        during your holidays you can come and visit her.
        Good-bye.
He leaves the room. The schoolteacher is thrown off
balance by all this. He stands up and takes a few steps.
He sits down again and thinks.
Finally, the door opens and Eva enters. She doesn't
really know what to do. Neither does the schoolteacher.
As she comes in he stands up again. Finally Eva goes
over to the table and sits down. The schoolteacher also
sits down. They exchange a short glance and an equally
brief smile.
PAUSE.
        SCHOOLTEACHER says: Did your father tell...?
         EVA: Yes.
PAUSE.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that all right with you?
PAUSE.
         EVA: Is that all right with you, sir?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles): Don't be so formal with
        me.
Eva looks up. Their eyes meet. Then she takes his hand
in her hand. They remain seated without saying a word.

                             
                                                            53

47. RECTORY. THE BOYS' BEDROOM. INT/NIGHT
It is dark. Martin, Anton and Florian, whom we don't
recognize at first glance, are lying in their beds.
Through the window, a red glow, slowly getting stronger.
Suddenly
         MARTIN'S VOICE: Toni! Are you awake?
       Toni!!
       ANTON'S VOICE (half asleep): What is it?
       MARTIN VOICE: Look.
       ANTON'S VOICE: What's happening?
        MARTIN VOICE: Look! Look what's happening out
        there!!
Now, Anton sits up slowly, rubs his eyes.
        ANTON'S VOICE: My God, what do you want?
        MARTIN VOICE: Over there!! Have a look out of
        the window!!
Anton turns to the window and looks at the red glow.
Then he slips out of the bed and goes to the window.
Suddenly, he is wide-awake:
        ANTON: Something is burning! Over there at the
        estate!
         MARTIN: Untie me!
Anton turns around to Martin, hesitates.
         MARTIN: Come on, untie me!
Anton doesn't really know what to do. He turns to the
window again, then again to Martin. The latter screams
angrily:
         I told you to untie me!!
       ANTON: I don't know...
        MARTIN: I'll beat you black and blue, if you
        don't untie me!
The loud dispute has now also awakened Florian, who says
in a drowsy voice:
        FLORIAN: What's happening? Why can't you be
        quiet.
       MARTIN: Flori, come over and untie me!
       FLORIAN: What's going on?
       MARTIN (yells): Untie me, dammit!! You idiots!
       It's burning!!
                                                           54

        FLORIAN: It's burning?
Florian gets up himself and patters to the window. He
looks out and then says, amazed and enthusiastic:
        It's burning!
        MARTIN (imitates him angrily): OK, it's burning!
        Now untie me, godammit!
Florian looks at Anton with questioning eyes and then
says to Martin:
        FLORIAN: But Father hasn't allowed it...
Reverse angle POV of the two boys at the window toward
Martin, who we see for the first from the front. His
wrists are tied to the left and the right side of the
bed. Trying sit up, he pulls furiously at his ties.
        MARTIN (furious): But if there's an emergency,
        you idiot. Somebody must warn them! (he yells
        loudly: Faaaather!! Mooooother!! Father!
Frightened by his screams, Anton now goes over to him
and undoes his ties.
        ANTON: Stop shouting. I'll untie you.
        FLORIAN: Shall I call Mother?
We already hear hurried STEPS in the corridor. The door
opens and the mother enters, dressed in a nightgown.
        MOTHER: What's going on here?
Martin has just been untied.
        MARTIN: It's burning!
        MOTHER: I know. Your father has already gone.
In the door, the girls appear after their mother. They
have left their room attracted by the noise. The mother
turns to them:
        MOTHER: What are you doing here? (to everyone):
        You all go to bed now. It's nothing. There's a
        fire on the estate. You don't need to be afraid.
        Go to bed and sleep. Come on, Marie, take your
        sisters with you and go to your room. Otherwise
        you'll catch a cold.
The girls disappear again. The mother turns to Martin:
        Why did you make so much noise? You woke us all
        up!
Martin doesn't know what to answer. Then he says
apologetically:
        MARTIN: I thought it was dangerous.
       ANTON (apologizing): I had to untie his hands.
       MOTHER (calming them down): Now, everything's
       all right again. Tomorrow, Father will tell you
       what happened with the fire. All right? Now you
                                                           55

        all got back to bed. I'll wait till you're back
        in bed. It's freezing cold outside.
The three boys go back to bed. But first Anton ties up
Martin's hands again. He pulls a blanket over his
brother. Then they all disappear under their blankets.

       MOTHER: Good night then. Sleep well.
        MARTIN, ANTON, FLORIAN: Good night, Mom!
The mother closes the door. Coming from outside, we can
see the glow of the fire.

                              

48. ESTATE EXT/NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT.
A big barn is blazing   fiercely. SOUNDS of the FIRE.
Against it we see,       as silhouettes, the Baron, the
steward and his wife,   the pastor, and all those, who are
vainly trying to save   thing.

                              


49. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE INT/NIGHT
In the children's bedroom, lit by the reflection from
the nearby flames: Liesl, Georg and Ferdinand. They
stand at the window and stare into the flames.


                              

50. FARM BUILDINGS /EXT/DAY
Paul discovers his dead father in the pigsty. The farmer
has hung himself up from a hook in the wall. The
knocked-over stool still lies beneath his dangling feet.
Paul runs from the stable out to the
courtyard. He stops.
Then he tiptoes toward the stable door. As he touches
the stable door, he lacks the strength to go inside
again. Slowly he heads for the living room. The
children, who are gathered, pay no attention to him.
Leni, who's cooking, has looked up from her work
briefly. Paul sits down on the bench against the wall.
It is quite dark in there.

                              


51. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE. OFFICE. INT/DAY
The doctor sits at his desk, the midwife sits on the
visitor's chair opposite him. She tries to masturbate
him.

                                                             56

This time, too, both are fully dressed. Over his
clothes, the doctor wears an unbuttoned white coat.
He watches the woman for a while in her activity, then
he says coldly:
        DOCTOR: Wouldn't it be better if you stopped
        doing that?
It's like a slap in the face. She looks dumbfounded.

       DOCTOR: Why all the effort? Don't look at me so
       dumbfounded.
       It's not that you lack talent... It's just that
       I can't do it with you any more, that's all.
       To tell you the truth: you disgust me.

He gets up and buttons up his pants. She feels as if the
world had collapsed around her.
        Please finish your work now? I don't want to
        spend all night here.
The midwife remains seated, her head bowed, as if struck
by a lightning
        MIDWIFE (quietly): What did I do to you?
        DOCTOR (irritated): My God, you haven't done
        anything at all. You're ugly, you're messy,
        you're flabby and you have bad breath. Isn't
        that enough?
PAUSE. He points at the examination couch on the other
side of the small room, saying casually:
        The upholstery has to be sterilized with boiling
        water
She remains immobile, and shoots a quick mechanical
glance at the examination couch. He looks at her.
        Stop sitting there as if you were carrying all
        the world's woes on your shoulders. The world
        won't collapse down. Not on you, or on me.
       (explains):I just want it to stop, that's all.
       I've been trying, but it's just disgusting. I
       try to think of another woman when I'm making
       love to you, a woman who smells good, who's
       young one, one who's less flabby than you, but
       my imagination can't handle it. In the end, it's
       you again and then I just feel like throwing up
       and am embarrassed at myself. So what's the
       point?!
       MIDWIFE: Are you through?
        DOCTOR:(contemptuously)): Yes, I have been for
        ages.
He turns away. The midwife hardly moves. She's still
sitting on the visitor's chair. It takes her a lot of

                                                           57

strength not to faint ­ at the same time she speaks out
calmly.

         MIDWIFE: You must be very unhappy to be so mean.
         DOCTOR: Oh God! Please, not that routine!
         MIDWIFE: I know that I'm not much to look at. My
         bad breath comes from my stomach, you know that
         very well. But it didn't bother you in the past
         when we got together. I already had my ulcer
         when your wife was still alive.
         DOCTOR: Please spare me these sordid details.
         But let me reassure you: it has always disgusted
         me. I accepted it, because I wanted to ease my
         pain after Erika's death and I didn't care with
         whom. I could have screwed a cow. Whores are
         unfortunately too far from here and regrettably
         once every two months isn't enough for me, even
         though I'm getting older. So skip your damn
         martyrdom routine and get out.


PAUSE.
         MIDWIFE (keeps on speaking softly): Why did this
         only occur to you now?
         DOCTOR: According to you: when should it have
         occurred to me?
         At the hospital, I had forgotten how tiresome
         you were. One grows sentimental when one's in
         pain.
PAUSE.
         DOCTOR (tired): Get out. Why don't you get out.
         Don't you have any pride?
         MIDWIFE (equally tired): There's no room for any
         with you.
         DOCTOR: That's true.
         MIDWIFE: Aren't    you   afraid   that   I   might   do
         something silly?
         DOCTOR (laughs with disdain): Go ahead. At least
         that would surprise me. But be careful: it might
         be painful.
         MIDWIFE: I know. I'm ridiculous. You wouldn't
         care anyway.
        DOCTOR: Well...
She looks at him.



                                                                   58

        MIDWIFE: Why do you despise me? For helping to
        raise the boy? For watching you fingering your
        little daughter and not saying a word?

The doctor goes over and slaps her. Tears start to run
down her face, but after a short pause she keeps on
speaking, "unmoved":

        For helping you to deceive yourself? For
        listening to you claim how unique your love for
        Erika was, though the whole village knew, how
        badly you treated her?
        For loving you, although I know you can't stand
        being loved?

The doctor snorts with disdain.

        DOCTOR: That's it. Now leave me alone. I've got
        work to do.

She gets up and makes room for him. He sits down at the
desk and "works". She looks down at him:

        MIDWIFE: You can't afford to get rid of me. Who
        would do the dirty work for you, who would help
        you with the children, and here in you practice?
        You're not speaking seriously. You just want to
        see how far you can go, don't you: will she
        still put up with it or can I drag her even
        lower through the mud?

PAUSE. The doctor "works", as if he hadn't heard. She
keeps watching him for a while, and then says softly:
        I'm tired too. I've got two retarded children:
        Hans and you. You're the one that gives me most
        trouble.
He looks up at her. After a pause, he says:
        DOCTOR: My God, why don't you just die?!


                                




52. FARM. EXT/DAY
Rays of cold winter sun.
The men carry the coffin out of the house. Some people
are already waiting outside. All wear mourning clothes.
The coffin is shouldered, the funeral procession forms,
with the pallbearers and in the lead. The others who had
gathered in the house follow. Paul comes out with Sepp,
whom he tries to calm. Finally Leni comes out and, in
                                                           59

words that we can't hear, asks the old midwife to look
after the farm for a short while. She gathers her
sisters and with them gets in the funeral procession
right behind the coffin.
The procession starts to move off. As it comes around
the corner of the farm to go down the path leading to
the village, Franz comes toward them. Muttering is heard
from the villagers. They don't know how to react. The
procession slows down. Franz comes over. For a while he
stands in front of the coffin, head bowed. Then he joins
his brothers and sisters. He and Leni exchange a glance,
then he takes his place beside her. After he has
motioned to the coffin bearers, the procession starts to
move off again slowly, despite of the continued
muttering. Paul, who is still carrying Sepp, looks
expectantly toward his older brother who squeezes his
hand. Paul smiles shyly. Then Franz takes over little
Sepp, in the most natural way. For a long moment it
almost looks as if, despite of all the gloom, these
people weren't desperate.
                             



53. VILLAGE AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE EXT/DAY
Various long shots of the snow-covered landscape.

        NARRATOR: The year was coming to an end with
        fine weather. The sun made the snowy landscape
        sparkle so brightly that it hurt the eyes.
        None of us suspected that it would be the last
        time a year moved on to the next in an era of
        peace, and that that same year a radical change
        would take place of which no one had the
        faintest inkling...
                                


54. RECTORY. LIVING ROOM. INT/DAY
The decorated Christmas tree. Outside bright sunlight.
The pastor is taking the white ribbon off Marie's head
and Martin's arm. The rest of the family witnesses this
almost solemn act.
        NARRATOR: ...Despite of the strange events, that
        had unsettled the village, we thought of
        ourselves as united in the belief that the life
        in our community was God's will and worth
        living.
        PASTOR: ... I take of this ribbon from you, in
        the belief that from now on you'll no longer
        need it.
        You, Marie, will be accepted this year as a full
        member of the church community. You will receive
                                                           60

        Christ's body as bread and as wine. May the time
        of preparation for the confirmation feast be one
        of happiness and enrichment.
        And you, Martin: from now on you shall not only
        be free of that ribbon, but also from those
        nightly ties that were intended to save you from
        yielding to the temptations of your young body.
        For in a house full of festive expectation, you
        too, on your own, shall make your contribution
        to mental and physical purity.
        I trust in you, my beloved children, and wish
        you a profitable and happy new year.
He strokes the children's heads. They kiss his hand. The
mother embraces them heartily.

                            

55. ESTATE EXT/DAY
Springtime.
The Baroness, Sigi and a new, a forty-ish nanny with the
twins are get out of a carriage in front of the manor.

        NARRATOR: Shortly after Easter, in the last week
        of April, the Baroness came back with the
        children. She was accompanied by a new nurse.
        Thus my secret hope that Eva would be able to
        come back here, had definitely been dashed.
        The nurse was a chubby, middle-aged Italian who
        came, as everybody soon learned, from the town
        on the Mediterranean coast where the Baroness
        had spent the winter.

A maid hurries out of the house with reinforcements, the
Baroness is being welcomed respectfully and the luggage
is being unloaded. The nurse gives instructions in
Italian, which leads to some confusion. Then the nanny
talks to Sigi who translates to the servants, laughing.
Besides, the boy looks transformed: instead of his
former pale skin color, his face now has a nice tan, his
fair hair has been further bleached by the sun, he has
grown taller and looks altogether stronger and happier.
The Baroness too seems more relaxed and restored.
She and Sigi are about to go straight into the house
when we hear, coming from the other side of the
courtyard
        FERDINAND'S VOICE: Sigi!
Sigi turns around. Ferdinand has seen him from the
window and called. Sigi waves back:
        SIGI: Hi, Ferdinand!
        FERDINAND: Wait! I'm coming down!
Sigi wants to run over to the steward's house.

                                                           61

       BARONESS:   Stay   here,   Sigi,   you   can   see   him
       later.
       NURSE (in Italian): Let him go, Signora! He's so
       happy to be home again.
        BARONESS (muses, then smiles): All right, you
        can go. But don't stay too long.
Sigi hurries off. The Baroness and the nurse look at
each other in agreement. The Baroness smiles faintly.
Then they go through the door into the house.
For a moment we only see the open door with the dark
stairwell behind it.
Then we hear the STEPS of the Baron, first on the gravel
in the yard. Then Baron comes into frame, and goes
through the door into the house. He vanishes into the
darkness of the stairwell. From there we hear his voice:
        BARON (calling): Beatrix? Beatrix, where are
        you?
The nurse comes out after a while again
        NURSE (calls in Italian): Sigi. Don't you want
        to come say hello to your father?
But Sigi is talking intensely to Ferdinand on the other
side of the courtyard and doesn't answer.


                             



56. SCHOOL. INT/DAY
CLASSROOMS.
The children are going wild. Brawling, sponge and chalk
are flying through the air. Some are packing up their
belongings, preparing to leave the classroom. In short,
the way children behave once the lesson is over.
Marie stands at the classroom door. She watches her
classmates. The she looks through the door into the
CORRIDOR.
It's empty. She comes back to the CLASSROOM, but stays
at the door so that she can still keep an eye on the
corridor. Apparently, she has been posted there as a
lookout to warn against the possible arrival of a
teacher.
The shouting, laughter and brawling goes on. Suddenly,
Marie sees the schoolteacher in the CORRIDOR
with her father. The two are having an animated
conversation. Marie bursts into the CLASSROOM and closes
the door to muffle the noise, then she shouts to her
classmates:
         MARIE: Watch out, he's coming!
But with all the shouting and laughter, her voice isn't
heard by all of the pupils. The noise dies down, some of
them stop misbehaving. Somebody picks up the sponge, and
                                                                  62

the blackboard is quickly cleaned up of the traces of
the fight. But a small group who had started to chase
each other around, doesn't hear and keeps at it. Marie
shouts to them again, this time louder:
        Be quiet! For God's sake! Be quiet!!
But as the wild chase goes on and some over-exited
children even make fun of her, and she yells at the top
of her voice:
        QUIET!!!!
At that moment, the door opens and the pastor comes in
with the schoolteacher.
Almost instantly, the room becomes QUIET. Without saying
a word, the pastor goes over to Marie, grabs her by the
ear and drags her through the whole classroom to the
stove, where he makes her stand, face to the wall. The
pupils remain silent, embarrassed.
While the pastor goes back to the black board, putting
his briefcase on the desk without saying a word, the
schoolteacher, who feels slightly responsible for the
lack of discipline of his classroom, says:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's going on here? Why are you
        still here? You know that there's a confirmation
        class now! Get out!
The children disappear quickly. To the first child who
tries to sneak out the schoolteacher says:
        How about saying good-bye?
Immediately all the CHILDREN rushing out say:
         Good-bye, Sir! Good-bye, Pastor!
Finally, all the children have left the classroom,
except eight candidates for confirmation, among them
Paul, Xenia and Marie with her face still turned to the
wall.
The schoolteacher turns to the pastor:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm sorry, Pastor. It won't
        happen again.
The pastor answers with a reserved nod. In an icy
silence, he has waited for the all the younger pupils to
leave. As the schoolteacher notices that there will be
no further reaction from the pastor, he bows slightly to
him and says:
        Good-bye, Pastor.
        PASTOR: Good-bye.
The schoolteacher leaves the room. The pastor turns to
the candidates for confirmation:
        Let us pray.
They say the LORD'S PRAYER together. Then the pastor
says:
        Sit down.

                                                           63

The students sit down. Marie keeps standing facing the
wall. The pastor stops too. After a while he begins to
talk.
        This is a very sad day for me.
        In a few weeks, we all want to celebrate the
        confirmation feast together.
        For many months I have tried to bring God's word
        closer to you, and to make responsible human
        beings out of you in His spirit.
        And what do I face today? A horde of yelling
        monkeys,   without  any   discipline   or   human
        dignity, as childish as the seven-year olds,
        with whom you're sharing this classroom.
        But what makes me even sadder is the fact that
        my own daughter is playing the leading role in
        this pitiful display.
        Last year I bound a white ribbon in her hair.
        Well, you all know that white is the color of
        innocence. The ribbon was meant to help Marie to
        avoid sin, selfishness, envy, indecency, lies
        and sloth.
        Well, at the start of the year, I was naive
        enough to believe, that now, in the year of her
        confirmation, she'd become mature enough, and
        that she wouldn't need that ribbon any more
        I believed that she felt responsible, being the
        daughter of the spiritual leader of a Christian
        communi...

Marie, who all this time has been waiting beside the
stove, faints and collapses to the floor.


                            


57. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE. INT/NIGHT
STAIRWELL.
The only light comes in from the living room. Rudolph
comes down the stairs, wearing a nightshirt.
        RUDOLPH (softly): Xeni?
He goes into the LIVING ROOM.
It's empty.
        RUDOLPH (as above, anxiously): Xeni? Where are
        you?
He goes into the KITCHEN.
It's also empty. Rudolph is desperate. He starts to cry.
Finally, he goes back to the STAIRWELL and goes up the
stairs to his room.
On the stairway, he notices light coming from under the
door of the practice. He goes back down the stairs down
again and opens the door of the PRACTICE.
In the bright light, sitting in front of each other, are
the doctor and Xenia. The doctor has his back to
Rudolph, so that we see Xenia's face first. She sits on
                                                            64

the visitor's chair. He has placed his chair in front of
hers, and his legs are closed around her legs. She's
crying.
The situation is ambiguous, we don't know what has
happened.
The noise at the door startles Xenia, she looks at
Rudolph:
         XENIA (startled, her face tearstained): Rudi?!
The doctor spins around, and looks stunned to his young
son. Both look as if they have been caught red-handed.
         XENIA: What are you doing here? Why aren't you
         in bed?
Rudolph doesn't really know, what to think of all this,
but   being    the  good   child   he   is,  he   answers
automatically:
         RUDOLPH: I can't get to sleep.
        XENIA: That's why you're wandering around like a
        ghost in the middle of the night?
        RUDOLPH: I woke up and you weren't there.
Short PAUSE. Xenia wipes the tears from her face.
        XENIA (trying to smile): Dad has pierced      my
        earlobes.
        RUDOLPH: Does it hurt?
        XENIA: Yes, a bit.
        RUDOLPH: That's why you're crying?
        XENIA (tries to smile): I'm not crying any more.
        DOCTOR (trying to joke): Beauty has to suffer.
        That's what they say. At least for girls...
He gets up and goes, still seen from behind, to a
closet, and puts something into it that we can't
recognize. He's straightens his clothes. Then he goes
over to Rudolph:
        DOCTOR: Now go to bed again. You too, Xeni.
        XENIA: Yes.
As Rudolph hesitates and looks at her dubiously, she
explains, almost eagerly:
        I haven't worn earrings for a long time, that's
        why my earlobes grew back again.
To show him, she grasps one of her ears.
        For Whitsun feast, when we all want to look our
        best make ourselves look beautiful, I'm getting
        new earrings. The ones that Mom had, with
        garnets...


                                                            65

Rudolph looks at her. He doesn't think she's telling the
truth.

                            


58. RECTORY. THE PASTOR'S STUDY. INT/DAY
Marie comes in. She's wearing a nightshirt, her hair is
damp and sticks to her head. She looks sick and
feverish.
She closes the door quietly, then goes to her father's
desk and opens a few drawers. She ends up finding the
letter-opener. It has a hilt and looks like a small
sword.
She takes the letter-opener, goes to the birdcage, puts
the letter-opener down beside it and grabs the tiny
canary. As the bird chirps, she glances round at the
door, as if to make sure that nobody is coming.
        NARRATOR: A few days after Marie's fainting-fit
        that frightened us all, and that was followed by
        her feverish and debilitated state...
She takes the bird into her left hand so that its little
head is turned upwards, and picks up the letter-opener
with her right hand...


                            


59. ESTATE. STEWARD'S HOUSE. INT/DAY
The schoolteacher is led by the steward's wife to the
living room. She carries an apron and her sleeves are
rolled up. Apparently she was just preparing a cake, and
her sticky hands make her open the door with her elbow.
Because of the narrator's voice, we don't grasp what
they're saying, but we understand that she's asking him
to come in and wait for the person he wants to see, and
that she can't keep him company now.
       NARRATOR:...I went to see the steward, because I
       wanted to borrow the carriage for the Whitsun
       holidays again.
       Since my marriage proposal, Eva had written me
       once a week, and I got the feeling that she felt
       lost and alone in the city, and was asking me
       between the lines to come to see her again,
       despite of her father's interdiction.
       I wanted to spend Whitsun Saturday with her so
       that I could be back on Sunday again and prepare
       the confirmation feast with the pastor.
       The steward had gone to the sawmill, but was
       supposed to be back any minute. His wife, who
       was busy preparing for Whitsun, asked me into
       the living room and to wait there for his
       return.
                                                           66

The steward's wife has left the room. The schoolteacher
sits around, bored. After a while he gets up, goes to
the window and looks out.
The courtyard is empty.
Suddenly, the schoolteacher hears a female VOICE in the
next room SPEAKING softly.
He listens, then he goes to the wing door and looks
through the gap on the etched glass-window of the door
into the next room.
There, Liesl sits beside the cradle and talks quietly to
the baby.
The schoolteacher opens the door. Liesl sees him, gets
up and greets him politely with a curtsy:
        LIESL: Good morning, Sir.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Hello, Liesl..
Smiling, the schoolteacher goes to the cradle and looks
into it.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: He's cute..
       LIESL: Yes, he is.
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Do you like him.
       LIESL: Yes. Very much.

       SCHOOLTEACHER: He was very sick last winter, I
       was told.
        LIESL: Yes. Very sick. But the doctor cured him.
        With God's help.
PAUSE. The schoolteacher looks out the window to see if
the steward isn't coming.
        SCHOOLTEACHER:   Maybe,  I'll   pop  back   this
        evening.
        LIESL: I'm sure Father will be back for coffee
        at four.
She looks at the grandfather clock, that indicates
quarter to four. The schoolteacher thinks for a moment,
then he goes to the living room:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Then, I'll go sit down again next
        door.
       LIESL: Can I bring you something?      A   cup   of
       coffee. I'm sure it's ready.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling at her eagerness): No,
        no. Thanks.
He stands in the door:
        I'll sit down over there again and just wait.
He wants to close the door behind himself. Suddenly
                                                             67

       LIESL says: Sir!
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes?
        LIESL: Can dreams come true?
The schoolteacher smiles, surprised at the unexpected
question:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: That depends, why?
       LIESL(serious): On what?
       SCHOOLTEACHER (smile): On what does it depend?
       Well if you dream of getting the first prize at
       the school feast, and study hard for it, then
       your dream can come true.
        LIESL, shakes her head, quietly: That's not what
        I meant.
The schoolteacher feels that she has something on her
mind and asks, this time without irony:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, what did you mean then?
She looks at him, wondering if she should really discuss
it. He nods to encourage her.
        LIESL: I mean, if you dream something in your
        sleep, I mean, if you really dream it in your
        sleep, can it come true?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (also serious): Why, what did you
        dream?
She bows her head.
The schoolteacher thinks for a moment, then he goes over
to her.
        Come on, tell me. You have something on your
        mind, haven't you?
She shakes her bowed head. But suddenly, she starts to
cry:
        LIESL (crying): I always dream such horrible
        things.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (dear): Tell me what you've been
        dreaming?
She sobs, he takes out a handkerchief and hands it to
her:
        Take this. Now, calm down again. And then tell
        me what's going on.
Liesl takes the handkerchief, blows her nose and wipes
away her tears. She doesn't completely manage to hold
her tears back, and breathes haltingly. She hands the
handkerchief back to the schoolteacher.
        LIESL: Thanks.
The schoolteacher puts the handkerchief away with an
imperceptible smile and then says reassuringly:
                                                           68

        SCHOOLTEACHER: All right. Now go on.
The girl sniffles a couple of times again, then swallows
and says quietly:
        LIESL: I dreamt that the Hansi ­ the midwife's
        odd little boy ...
        SCHOOLTEACHER (reassuringly): I know, I know.
        LIESL: - ...that something very bad is going to
        happen to him.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Something very bad?
Liesl nods eagerly.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Like what?
        LIESL: I don't know. Something like what
        happened to Sigi not long ago. But even worse.
She starts to cry again:
        But he's so sweet. He harms no one.
Touched, the schoolteacher puts his arm around Liesl's
shoulder.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: All right. All right. That was
        just a dream. You needn't take it so seriously.
        LIESL (crying): They always make fun of him,
        because he doesn't really...
        SCHOOLTEACHER (calmly): Yes, I know, but nobody
        will do him any harm, you can be sure of that.
Liesl can't calm down.
        Do you want my handkerchief back?
She shakes her head.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What gave you the idea that your
        dream would come true?
She just shakes her head, and keeps on crying. Then he
takes the handkerchief out again and hands it to her. As
she doesn't take it, he nudges her. She looks up,
confused. He holds the handkerchief again with a
cheerful nod. She takes it and blows her nose. The she
slowly calms down.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (now "reasonable" in order to
        "calm her down"): Dreams don't come true. Let
        alone that kind.
She shrugs her shoulders, as if she disagrees with what
he's saying. Her head bowed she stands before him,
holding his handkerchief.
She breathes a few more times, then says with an almost
"adult" voice:
        LIESL(serious): But sometimes my dreams do come
        true.

                                                           69

         SCHOOLTEACHER: What do you mean?
PAUSE.
         LIESL says: Last winter, before Putzl (she
         points to the baby) became ill, I dreamt that my
         brother put him beside the open window, so that
         he'd die.
         And the day the window was open and he caught a
         chill and he almost died.

The schoolteacher is completely perplexed. At first he
doesn't know what to say.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What are you saying there? That's
        complete nonsense!
Liesl bows her head again.

         SCHOOLTEACHER: Somebody probably didn't close
         the window properly.
         What gave you that idea? Why would your brother
         do such a thing?

         LIESL,(defiantly, as he's not believing her):
         Because he's jealous.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: And because you believe that, you
         dreamt it. It doesn't mean anything at all. It's
         just a coincidence.
         LIESL (keeping her head bowed): All right.

The schoolteacher bends over to catch her gaze.

         SCHOOLTEACHER: Look at me.


She looks at him reluctantly, maintaining her defiant
reserve.

         SCHOOLTEACHER: Don't tell such stories to
         anybody!
         You obviously don't realize the harm you can do
         with it.
Again she looks down at the floor.
        You didn't tell the story         to   your   parents,
        didn't you?
She shakes her head.
         All right then.
         Forget it quickly.   I   shall    forget     it,   too.
         Promise?
As she doesn't answer, he repeats:
        Promise?
                                                                   70

She nods almost imperceptibly.

        Good.
        Now can I have my handkerchief back...

He holds his hand out to her. Astonished she looks at
the handkerchief in her hands. She had forgotten it
completely, and gives it back the schoolteacher.
        Thank you.
He pockets the handkerchief.
        Now, we both have a secret. And you promise me
        that it will remain a secret between us. All
        right?
She nods reluctantly. He insists, seeks her gaze:
        Yes?!
        LIESL (reluctantly): Yes.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well. All right then.
        You don't have to worry. Nothing will happen to
        Hansi.
        (smiling): Nobody is jealous of him.

She glances at him to see whether he's making fun of
her. He looks at her seriously and gives her a nod that
demands an answer. She nods briefly. But it isn't clear
whether she just does it to please him.
        Dreams don't come true. That only happens in
        fairy-tales. Forget all about it.
He looks at her, as she stands there, head bowed.
Finally he smiles and tries to "crack a joke" to make
the matter less serious:
        Do you know what they did to little girls who
        predicted the future in ancient times? They
        burned them at the stake as witches.
She looks up at him, round-eyed.

                            

60. RECTORY. THE PASTOR'S STUDY. INT/DAY
The pastor comes through the door, goes to his desk, and
is about to put down his briefcase.
The dead bird lies in the middle of the desk with its
wings spread out. The pastor's letter-opener is stuck in
its neck - only the hilt sticks out from its beak.

                            



                                                           71

61. STREET. EXT/DAY
The schoolteacher and Eva drive in the carriage. In the
background, we catch glimpses of the town.

        NARRATOR: We had arranged to meet at the town
        railway station, since Eva wanted to avoid being
        seen with me. She was living with distant
        relatives,   who    were    apparently   reporting
        regularly to Eva's parents about her life-style.
        She had become thinner which made her even
        prettier, and once again I was ravished by her
        mixture   of   shyness    and    almost  childlike
        outspokenness.
        EVA (imitating somebody): ..."...You want your
        hair parted r to the right or to the left?" "How
        about one parting to the left and one to the
        right"?
Both laugh heartily.
        All the people in the saloon were laughing their
        heads   off.    Even    Mr.    Murer,   who's   so
        distinguished that he never cracks a smile, had
        to laugh.
SHORT PAUSE, in which the laughter fades down.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Then, it isn't really so awful,
        is it?
        EVA: No. But sweeping up hair all day ­ honestly
        the twins were more fun, I must say.
        But it's all right. I can't really complain.

The schoolteacher looks at her sideways, smiling:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: No?
She looks at him, doesn't understand that he's trying to
make her complain about their forced separation, and
says cheerfully:
        EVA: No. Really.
The schoolteacher exchanges a smiling glance with her,
then looks back at the road:
        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling): And apart from the
        twins, there's nothing you're missing?
She looks at him, surprised. Suddenly, she understands.
She shakes her head with a smile, then takes his hand
for a short moment, as if she were apologizing for her
lack of sensitivity.
        EVA: Oh, you of course!
He looks at her hand on his, but she already has
withdrawn it. Both seem very happy. After a few moments,
during which the horse keeps trotting, Eva leans against
the schoolteacher and puts her head against his
shoulder. But the shaking of the carriage on the rutted
road makes that position untenable and so they sit side
by side again and drive on. Finally
                                                             72

       EVA says: And how is the nurse? Does she only
       speak Italian?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: I   don't   know.   That's   what   the
       steward told me.
        EVA: I see.
At that moment the road crosses a brook, that runs
through a small wood. The schoolteacher steers the
carriage on to a trail that branches off the road after
the bridge.
        EVA: Where are you going?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Over there, into the forest
       beside the brook. We can picnic over there. I
       brought a basket of food.
       EVA (softly): I don't want that.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (perplexed): Why?
Eva looks down and shakes her head. The schoolteacher
stops the carriage, turns to her:
        What's going on?
        EVA: Nothing. Please.
Now he understands. He smiles although he can't really
understand that she's been thinking such a thing of him.
Now he talks to her almost as to a child, astonished and
reassuringly.
        SCHOOLTEACHER:   But  I   don't  want   anything
        forbidden from you. I just wanted you to enjoy
        the picnic.
She looks up at him.
        EVA: Please.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (astonished): Do you think, I
        might want to bring disgrace on my future wife?
She keeps looking at him pleadingly. Finally he gives
in, slightly disappointed:
        All right then. I'll turn over there.
He drives on. After a few meters, Eva puts her hand on
his hands and on the reins. He stops the carriage, she
looks at him.
        EVA: Thanks.
He doesn't know what say. They look at each other.
Suddenly Eva leans forward and kisses him on the lips
very cautiously. They remain that way for a long while
without their bodies touching each other.
After separating, they forget at first to keep
breathing. Then, once the worst of the confusion has
abated, they both turn away from each other. The
schoolteacher lets the horse start trotting again, and
                                                                73

they sit side by side on the bumping vehicle, looking
straight ahead, quiet and overwhelmed by the happiness
of the moment.

                            


62. CHURCH INT/DAY
The church is packed.
The 8 candidates for confirmation are kneeling at the
Communion bench. One after the other, the pastor puts
the cup to their lips.

       PASTOR:
       Accept and drink!
       This is the blood of the New Testament,
       Shed for the forgiveness of your sins.

As he reaches Marie, who is kneeling fifth in line, he
hesitates a long moment. For so long, that this causes a
few irritated stares from the devout parish. Even more
than the other children, Marie is also numb with
excitement. It almost looks like she might faint again.
But then he holds out the cup to her too, and she
drinks:

       Accept and drink!
       That is the blood of the new will,
       spilled for you so that your sins         will   be
       forgiven.

He wipes the cup, where Marie's mouth drank ­ as he does
after each child - and goes on to the next one,
repeating the rite...


                            

63. FOREST EXT/NIGHT
Distant VOICES. At first incomprehensible. Gradually we
understand them better:
        VOICES: Hansi? Where are you? Give us a sign!
        Hansi, where are you?
Here and there silhouettes appear in the half-light.
Some carry lanterns, other torches. It takes some time
before they get nearer and become recognizable: they're
men and women from the village.
After a while
        MAN'S VOICE(calling): Over here. He's here.
We follow those running over: Bound to a tree is a small
boy. His whole head is wrapped up in rags. A small slit
has been left open so the nose can breathe. He MOANS.
                                                             74

A paper has been tied around his neck with a white
ribbon.
The people hurry toward the child, free the child of its
fetters. The child slumps down, his head is unwrapped,
covered in blood: it's the mongoloid son of the midwife.
Astonished, somebody reads the words written in block
letters on the paper):

        FOR I THE LORD YOUR GOD AM A JEALOUS GOD,
        VISITING THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS UPON THE
        CHILDREN TO THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH GENERATION
        OF THOSE WHO HATE ME.


                            


64. SCHOOL. INT/DAY
CORRIDOR.
Marie, Martin, Paul, Georg, and a couple of other
children are waiting at the classroom door. They remain
silent. They're listening.

        NARRATOR:   After    this   intricate  atrocity
        committed on the retarded boy, even the Baron
        was finally convinced that it would be more
        intelligent to call upon the professional help
        of the county's police force.
        So a few days later a couple of plainclothes
        policemen arrived and, after a visit to the
        several of the crime scenes, started to ask in
        various homes if anyone had noticed anything
        suspicious.

CLASSROOM

The two detectives question Liesl in the presence of the
schoolteacher and become more and more aggressive. Liesl
ends up crying.

        NARRATOR: After learning of Hansi's torture, I
        didn't think at first of what Liesl had told me.
        When it came back to my mind, I at first
        hesitated to tell the authorities about it.
        Because of such an absurd coincidence, I didn't
        want to jeopardize the reputation and inner
        peace of the steward's family.
        But when I heard that Hansi might loose his
        eyesight because of his injuries, one afternoon
        I made Liesl come to school and tell the police
        officers about her dream.
        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: ...Thank God, we're not as
        stupid as you might think.

                                                           75

        LIESL (crying, desperate): But I only dreamt it.
PAUSE. The officers exchange an impatient look with the
schoolteacher, who himself doesn't really know what to
think of Liesl's story. He looks at her thoughtfully.
The police officer turns to the girl again:
        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Now listen carefully! I'll
        give you a last chance: you tell me, who told
        you about the plan to torture the boy, and we
        won't tell anybody who told us. All right?
Liesl shakes her head desperately, crying again. The
police officer looks at the schoolteacher. The latter
doubts whether he should speak up. He feels sorry for
the girl. Finally, he says:
        SCHOOLTEACHER:   She's    already   dreamed   of
        something that has come true.
       FIRST POLICE OFFICER (ironic): Is that so? And
       what was it, if I may ask?
       SCHOOLTEACHER (wanting to spare her      talking
       about it): Something that happened       in her
       family.
       FIRST POLICE OFFICER (just as before): I see.
       Something to do with her family. And have you
       checked if it was true?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (irritated): No.
The police officer looks at him, grunts with disdain,
and turns to his colleague:
        FIRST POLICE OFFICER (scornfully): Well, all
        that may be true. Maybe we're really dealing
        here with an authentic clairvoyant, and we don't
        realize how lucky we are. Maybe we only need to
        ask her, who's behind all this. The we send her
        to bed, she dreams a bit, and tomorrow she tells
        us who did it. How about that? Everything's
        possible, isn't it?
Suddenly, he yells at the girl:
        Stop crying!
Liesl jumps up with fear. The police officer stands
right in front of her:

       Your deceitful whining won't work with me. I've
       got other ways to make you talk. I don't believe
       in witches and magicians, let alone that a
       chubby little girl like you has supernatural
       hallucinations. Therefore you'd better get used
       to the idea of telling the truth, because you
       won't bet rid of me until you've come clean. Is
       that clear?
       All right, and now we're going to visit your
       parents to see what they think of your version
       of the story.
                                                           76

He pulls the girl to her feet. She's thoroughly
intimidated, and sniffles faintly. Then he leads her
toward the door, at the same time turning to the
schoolteacher:
        I'd be grateful if you came too.
The schoolteacher finds the policeman's behavior toward
the child exaggeratedly aggressive, but he follows
reluctantly:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Of course.
The police officer opens the door to the

CORRIDOR

and almost bumps into a group of pupils that have
assembled there.
        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Oooops! What do we have
        here?
           MARIE (kindly): Good afternoon. Good afternoon,
           Sir.
        CHILDREN (as before): Good afternoon. Good
        afternoon, Sir.
Obviously the schoolteacher didn't expect them, but
doesn't want to show it in front of the police.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good afternoon.
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Why are you eavesdropping?
        MARIE (politely): We saw from outside that the
        schoolteacher was having visitors. We didn't
        want to intrude. We were just waiting to talk to
        the schoolteacher.
PAUSE. The police officer looks at the schoolteacher:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What do you want?
        MARIE (as if she was too shy to talk in front of
        strangers: We wanted to ask you something about
        Hansi.
Again, the police officer looks at the schoolteacher.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What is it?
           MARIE (hesitates a moment, then "screws up her
           courage" and asks): We heard he isn't well. We
           just wanted to ask if we could be of any help.


                               




                                                              77

65. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE INT/NIGHT
The doctor carefully examines Hansi's wounds. Especially
the areas around eyes that are badly affected. The boy
moans softly.
The midwife stands beside him, trying to stay calm, but
she is paralyzed with fear, and visibly still in a state
of shock.
It's very quiet. The doctor speaks with a soothing,
almost tender voice to the child, who keeps on moaning:
         DOCTOR (softly): All right... Everything's all
         right, Hansi... I know, it hurts... You've got
         to be patient... everything will be fine
         again... everything...
He has finished his treatment (and has bandaged the
boy's eyes again), and wants get up. But Hansi's hand
clings to his, and holds him back. He hesitates a
moment. The doctor and the midwife exchange a brief
glance. Then, the doctor cautiously frees his hand from
the child's.
         I have to go now, Hansi. Don't worry, I'll be
         back tomorrow.
The boy moans louder and tries again to grasp the hand
of the doctor, who he can't see. Brief exchange of
glances between the doctor and the midwife, who ends up
sitting on Hansi's bed, taking the boy's hands.
         MIDWIFE: It's all right, Hansi. Don't be afraid.
         The Doctor will be back.
The doctor motions to the midwife that she should stay
with the child, and leaves the room silently and almost
hastily.


                            


66. LANDSCAPE WITH A BROOK AND PASTURES EXT/DAY
Sitting at a brook, Sigi, Ferdinand and Georg have cut
willow twigs with their pocketknives and are now carving
whistles out of them. Their feet dangle in the water,
they're concentrated on their work.
Georg is the first to have finished. Proudly he tries it
out, but the little whistle doesn't sound very good. He
hides his disappointment, and keeps on carving to
improve the sound.
Then Sigi's whistle is ready and it sounds very good.
Sigi is delighted. After a short and proud look over to
his rivals, he leans back into the grass and keeps on
whistling.
Georg looks with irritation at the "braggart", and keeps
on carving. Then he gives it another try, but the
whistle doesn't sound much better than before.
Sigi's   whistling   makes   Georg's  seem   ridiculous.
Ferdinand looks at Georg with a gloating grin.

                                                            78

Suddenly Georg pounces on Sigi and tries to grab his
whistle. Sigi fights back and refuses to let go.
Ferdinand also gets up and watches the two, grinning.

Even if Sigi is no longer the weakling he used to be
before his stay in Italy, Georg, who is three years
older than him, is much stronger: with the weight of his
whole body he charges at Sigi, making him fall backward
into the shallow water of the brook, and takes his
whistle away.
The shock almost knocks out Sigi, and though the stream
isn't deep, half of his head lies under the flowing
water. Georg sees the danger, but his pride prevents him
from helping him, as it means admitting his own unjust
behavior. For a moment he hesitates, a helpless and
defiant grin on his face. But Ferdinand has already
jumped into the water and pulls out Sigi, who shakes his
head to fully come to his senses.
Ferdinand looks up at Georg, who is standing on the
bank, still holding the whistle in his hand. Then Georg
points his finger at him, and says furiously and
guiltily.
        GEORG (threatening): If you rat on me, you'll be
        sorry!


                            


67. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DAY
The pastor sits at his desk, working. A KNOCK is heard.
        PASTOR: Come in!
Florian comes in, hesitantly. In his hand, he carries a
birdcage (we've already seen it in Scene 49 in the boy's
bedroom at night). In the cage is the bird that Florian
had found on Thanksgiving day, and who has recovered in
the meantime.
        PASTOR: Yes?
The boy looks embarrassed. He glances at his father,
then comes over with the cage and puts it carefully on
his father's desk. As Florian approaches, the pastor
looked on, amazed. After putting down the cage, Florian
steps back a little, then stops, his head slightly
bowed.
        PASTOR (not really understanding): What is it?
        What do you want?
        FLORIAN (softly): For Pipsi. (PAUSE. Then even
        more softly): Because Father is sad.
The pastor looks at him, doesn't know how to react.
Then,   with  a   hoarse   voice  and  trying to  look
indifferent, he says:
        PASTOR: Thank you.
                                                           79

        FLORIAN (as apprehensive in front of his
        father's perceptible emotion): You're welcome,
        Father.
For a moment, neither of them knows what to do. Then the
boy leaves the room.
The pastor follows him with his eyes. Then, he sits
down. He tries to keep his composure, but in the end he
bursts into tears. He sobs haltingly, trying hard not
let it be heard.


                                

68.THE STEWARD'S HOUSE INT/EXT/DAY

THE CHILDREN'S ROOM.
Georg stands at the window and looks down at the

COURTYARD

Coming from   the   manor,   the   steward   is   walking   over
briskly.

THE CHILDREN'S ROOM.
Georg leaves the window and sits down at his table,
doing his homework.
We hear the FRONT DOOR opening downstairs, then the
father's hasty STEPS on the stairs.
Finally, the father appears in the door. He's out of
breath, furious, and tries to speak quietly
        STEWARD: Give me that whistle!
Georg looks at his father, "not understanding".
        GEORG: I beg your pardon?
        STEWARD (forcedly, with threatening calm): Give
        me that whistle!
        GEORG: What whistle?
At this, the steward pounces on the boy and smacks him
so hard that he falls out of his chair.
        Give it to me!
        GEORG (on the ground): What whistle?
The steward yanks him up and shoves him against the
wall. Georg stumbles over the table which is standing in
the way, and lies back on the table top, trying to
protect his face with his hands.
        STEWARD: Give away it to me, or I'll kill you.
        GEORG (half moaning): I have no whistle.
The steward lets go of him and starts to beat                him
furiously.
                                                                   80

        GEORG (screaming): Ouch! ...Ouch!!
        STEWARD (beat): You bastard, you wretch!
        GEORG (scream): Ouch! Ouch! !! Please don't
At that moment, attracted by the noise, Emma, the
mother, appears:
        EMMA: For God's sake, Georg, what are you doing?
        What has the boy done?
The mother's arrival has snapped the father out of his
blind rage. He glances at her, then turns to the boy
again, breathless with excitement, but forcing himself
to be calm:
        STEWARD: For the last time: give it to me!
        GEORG (almost crying with pain): But I don't
        know what you mean, Father.
The mother looks uncomprehendingly from one to the
other, then turns pleadingly to her husband:
        EMMA: What's going on? What are you talking
        about?
        STEWARD (to Georg): You know exactly what I
        mean.
Again the mother looks from one to the other, trying to
save the situation:
        EMMA: But if he says so! Georg! What's going on?
The steward turns to her, annoyed by her insistence,
looks at her for a long moment, then at Georg again and
turns on his heels and leaves the room.

STAIRWELL.

The steward runs down the stairs. The mother follows
him.
        EMMA (excited): Georg! Please wait! What did the
        boy do?! Please, tell me! Why are you so
        furious?
She reaches the steward as he is just about to open the
front door and places herself in front of him.
        EMMA (imploring, "reasonable"): Georg! Please!
        Calm down. If you could tell me...
        STEWARD (also "reasonable", in order to get rid
        of her): Please don't interfere. Leave me alone
        now! I have to go back to the Baron. He...
At that moment we hear from upstairs the full SOUND of
Sigi's whistle s from above, wild and lasting.
For a moment, the steward is paralyzed, then he seizes
the horsewhip hanging from hook in the wardrobe and
dashes upstairs. We hear him thrashing the boy in the

                                                           81

room, and soon the WHISTLING is replaced by Georg's
SCREAMS OF PAIN
After a short hesitation, the mother runs upstairs after
her husband, and we now hear her trying in vain trying
to control her husband.
        EMMA: Georg! Please! Stop it! Don't kill him...!


                             


69. ESTATE. DINING ROOM. COURTYARD. INT/EXT/NIGHT
The meal is over. The Baroness watches the maid clearing
the table and putting everything away on a tray.
The Baron has stood up, standing with his back to his
wife. He pours himself a glass of brandy.
        BARON: ... with the birches over there in Aigen
        that should make about six-thousand cubic
        meters. Working steadily, they should have
        finished it within three weeks. If until the end
        of the month we...
The maid has left with the tray.
        BARONESS (interrupts him): I won't stay here.
         BARON (doesn't understand): What did you say?
         BARONESS: I won't stay here.
         BARON (turns around to her): What do you mean
         BARONESS: What I mean is that I shall leave with
         the children.
         BARON: What do you mean: you're leaving with the
         children?
         BARONESS:   Come  on,   Armin!  It's   not   that
         difficult to understand, is it?
PAUSE.
         BARON: May I ask you how you plan to do that?
         BARONESS (quiet): I don't know yet. But in any
         case, we're leaving this place.
         BARON (sarcastic): We.
Look of the Baroness ("I don't need that kind of
irony").
         BARONESS: Yes.
The maid enters to clear the rest of the table. It leads
to a longer PAUSE. The Baron drinks his brandy, goes to
the window, waits. As the maid leaves the room, she
looks at the Baroness inquiringly:


                                                             82

         BARONESS (to the maid): I don't need you any
         longer. Thank you.
         MAID: Good night, Baroness. Good night, Baron.
        BARONESS: Good night.
Even after the maid has left, they remain SILENT for
quite a long while. Finally, she says
        BARONESS: I returned from Italy only out of
        deceny toward you. I wanted to give us a chance.
         BARON (turns around): You wanted me "to give me
         a chance"?!
         BARONESS: Yes.
         BARON: Well, that's brilliant! And did I miss my
         chance? Or what?
PAUSE.
         BARONESS (quietly): Do you think that will help
         us solve the problem?
         BARON: What?
         BARONESS: Your sarcasm.
        BARON: Actually, what is the problem that has to
        be solved?
The Baroness looks at him, then gets up and wants to
leave the room.
        BARON (suddenly yelling): You stay here!!
She turns around, looks at him.
        BARON (softer): You only leave this room if I
        tell you to do so.
She looks at him.
        BARONESS: Fine.
She goes back to her chair and sits down.
         BARONESS: I wanted to spare you this, but you
         force me to do it:
         During our stay with Uncle Edoardo I fell in
         love with a man. He's from Lombardy, he works in
         the banking business and helped Uncle Edoardo in
         a financial matter. He courted me and was also
         very fond of the children. If Sigi has blossomed
         and grown so healthy, it's largely thanks to
         him.
         Despite all this, we came back.
         Because I feel committed to you. But I can't
         stand this place any longer. Not so much for me
         personally, though I can't say that life with
         you is exactly thrilling for a woman of my age.
         But if I leave this place, it's because I don't
                                                            83

         want Sigi, and later the twins, to grow up in
         surroundings dominated by malice, envy, apathy
         and brutality. What happened with Sigi's whistle
         was the last straw. I'm sick and tired of
         persecutions, threats and perverse acts of
         revenge.
PAUSE.
         BARON: Did you sleep with him?
         BARONESS   (laughing   scornfully):   You   don't
         understand anything.
         BARON: Did you sleep with him?
PAUSE.
         BARONESS (quietly): No. I didn't sleep with him.
PAUSE.
        BARON: You're lying, aren't you?
The Baroness looks at him. Then she gets up, about to
leave the room again. At the same moment, somebody
KNOCKS at the door. After a short gesture of irritation
        BARON (irked): Come in!
The steward appears.
        STEWARD: Good evening. Could I talk to you for a
        moment, Baron?
         BARON (annoyed): Can't it wait until tomorrow?
        STEWARD:   It's  really   urgent.   Normally,  I
        wouldn't have disturbed you so late.
Annoyed, the Baron leaves the room with him. As he goes
out, the steward greets the Baroness with a nod.
Once the door is closed, she stops for a moment, goes to
the window, and looks out pensive. She ends up going to
the small bar and pours herself a glass of brandy. Her
hands are shaking a little. She drinks from the glass,
goes back to the window and looks out waiting, taking a
sip from now and then. Below in the

COURTYARD

a few people walk around nervously. But it doesn't look
particularly unusual. A saddled horse is led into the
stable. Finally, the door of the

DINING ROOM
opens again. The Baron comes back inside. He looks
distressed. The Baroness doesn't know whether this is
the result of her conversation, or of the message
brought by the steward. The Baron paces a few steps,
pondering, then glances at his wife. Finally, she asks
        BARONESS: What's going on?

                                                             84

       BARON: They've shot the heir to the throne of
       Austria. In Sarajevo.


                            


70. VILLAGE AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE EXT/DAY
The same setting as in Scene 57. The countryside in all
its summer splendor.

       NARRATOR: The news spread around the village
       like wildfire. What would the consequences be?
       The first person who spoke the word WAR, was
       severely contradicted. But once it had been
       uttered, it remained at the center of all our
       thoughts in a curiously stubborn way.
       I wanted to go to the town as quickly as
       possible, in order to discuss it with Eva, what
       we should do if war broke out. Perhaps her
       father would now agree to an earlier marriage.
       I asked the Baroness for the bicycle, with which
       Eva had visited her parents some time ago. The
       following weekend I planned use it to ride to
       town and see her.


                            


71. ESTATE EXT/DAY
The schoolteacher is pushing the bicycle out of the
manor house. He says good-bye to a maid, who closes the
door behind him. Some SHOUTING o.s. makes him look
toward the steward's house: the steward comes out with
the midwife, and it looks like he's throwing her out
with a flood of angry insults.
        NARRATOR: When I went to the estate on Friday
        evening to pick up the bicycle, so I could take
        it with me to the school, and get going early,
        as the trip was a quite long one, I witnessed a
        strange confrontation:
        STEWARD: ...completely mad! Go if you want.
        He'll throw you out on your ear.
        Slandering other people and creating trouble.
        That's all we need now!
        Get out and never come back again! This is
        unbelievable!
        Go ahead, do whatever you think you have to do!
        You're hysterical!
        MIDWIFE (simultaneously): ...I'll go to the
        Baron. We'll see what he says. You won't silence
        me. Who do you think you are?! You'll see. I'll

                                                           85

        tell him that you tried to prevent me from
        giving the police a statement.
Angrily the steward slams the door behind him. At first
the midwife doesn't know what to do. Finally she turns
away from the door and starts to cross the yard. There,
she sees the schoolteacher. She comes over to him.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good afternoon, Mrs. Wagner.
        What's happening?
         MIDWIFE (very excited): Good afternoon. Can I
         borrow your bicycle?
         SCHOOLTEACHER: It's not mine.
         MIDWIFE: Could I borrow it just the same?
         SCHOOLTEACHER: I just borrowed it myself.      I
         going to ride to town, to see my fiancée..
         MIDWIFE: Please! Lend it to me!
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Why do you need it? Where do you
         want to go?
         MIDWIFE: I must go to town.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: What for?
         MIDWIFE: I asked the steward for a carriage, but
         that stubborn fool won't agree to anything.
PAUSE.
         Please! Lend me the bicycle.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why? What is going on?
After hesitating a while
        MIDWIFE: I have to go to the police in town. I
        now know who committed all these crimes.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (flabbergasted): Who?
         MIDWIFE: Will you let me have the bicycle?
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Why don't you tell me?
         MIDWIFE: From now on I shall only talk to the
         police. I won't let them insult me (turning to
         the steward's house): As you just saw.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Can't the doctor can lend you his
         horse?
        MIDWIFE: I don't know how to ride.
The schoolteacher looks at her inquisitively, because he
still doesn't understand what it's all about, but she
doesn't respond, and says:

                                                            86

         MIDWIFE: Please! Believe me! (She hesitates and
         adds, now quietly and imploringly):
         My son told me who did it to him. He may loose
         his eyesight.
         Please, you let me have the bicycle!

The schoolteacher looks at her. The midwife looks
pitiful: she tries to smile at him pleadingly, tears are
streaming down her face.
Finally, he gives the bicycle to her. She grabs it
quickly, says
         Thanks!
and rides away. The schoolteacher remains behind, alone.
He stands pensive, then he goes slowly back to the
village.
         NARRATOR: The state that woman was in, who I
         knew was level-headed, had deeply impressed me.
         What had her son told her, that she didn't dare
         tell anybody?


                             


72. VILLAGE STREET. EXT/DUSK
The schoolteacher goes home.
TRACKING SHOT.
        NARRATOR: With each step I took from the estate
        back to the school, I felt more foolish for
        having given away the bicycle.
As he passes the midwife's house, he sees behind the
fence in the garden, half hidden behind the bushes,
Marie and a few other children. The shutters of the
house are closed.
        As I passed the midwife's house, I saw Marie,
        Martin, and a few other children in the garden.
The schoolteacher stops, watches the children. After a
few moments, they notice that somebody is watching them.
        MARIE: Good evening, Sir.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening, Marie.
         CHILDREN: Good evening, Sir.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: What are you doing here?
         MARIE: We wanted to see how Hansi was doing.
PAUSE.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: But can't       you   see   that   the
         shutters are closed.
PAUSE.

                                                                 87

         MARIE: Yes. We were worried. We saw Mrs. Wagner
         riding off on a bicycle. So we wondered what had
         happened to Hansi.
PAUSE.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Go home now. Nobody said you
        could come in here.
The children go out slowly. They open the wooden gate in
the fence, and go out into the street. They're visibly
embarrassed at being caught by the schoolteacher when
they were doing something wrong. Some avoid the
schoolteacher's eyes, while others mutter a greeting, as
if they wanted to say goodbye, as they went away. The
schoolteacher looks annoyed. As Marie steps out of the
garden door, he says:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: You better go back home now,
        hurry.
Marie doesn't seem to feel guilty at all. Again she
greets him politely.
        MARIE: Good evening, Teacher.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (reluctantly): Good evening.
The children go away. The schoolteacher also goes on his
way. After a few steps he turns around and looks at the
children, then walks on.

         NARRATOR: Then I thought of Liesl's dream again.
         What if Liesl hadn't dreamt, but had known, that
         Hansi was going to be tortured. Whose crimes did
         she know of? Whose name had she refused to
         reveal?
         The strong interest of the children in Hansi
         seemed strange to me, considering that they had
         usually refused to have any contact with him
         because of his disability, or only dealt with
         him in a rather disdainful manner.

The schoolteacher stops. He ponders about this. Then he
goes back to the midwife's house.

         Suddenly I wondered why the midwife had closed
         the shutters of the house. Nobody in the village
         ever shut their house. Why had the midwife
         locked her boy in?

He has reached the front of the house again. Indeed,
with its closed shutters, it looks uninhabited. Only
because of the tidy little front garden, could one tell
that somebody lived there.
The schoolteacher opens the garden gate and goes up to
the house. He tries to open the door and then the
shutters. Everything is well shut. He peers through the
cracks in the wooden shutters.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Hansi? Can you hear me? Hansi!
                                                            88

Nobody seems to answer. For a short moment the
schoolteacher disappears behind the house, apparently
looking for another way to get inside. But he soon comes
back without having found anything.
        NARRATOR: If the midwife couldn't take care of
        him, she would have entrusted the boy to me, or
        to the doctor. But since the night he was
        mistreated, I hadn't seen him again.
He leaves the midwife's house and hurries to the
neighboring house, the doctor's.
        I decided to ask the doctor directly.
He enters the property, goes up to the entrance and
rings. Nobody answers. He rings again, then he sees a
note tacked up:

          The doctor's practice is closed
                until further notice

                            


73. RECTORY. INT/NIGHT
STAIRWELL.
The pastor's wife and the schoolteacher stand before the
closed front door.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: His daughter? Wasn't she with you
        at your school?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, she was.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: And she didn't say anything?
The schoolteacher shakes his head. They both remain
silent and pensive.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: I have a request.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: Yes?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Could I ask Marie and Martin?
        PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to wait for my
        husband? He's at the church. The service will be
        over in a quarter of an hour. But if you insist.
        Please, come in.
She opens the door

LIVING ROOM

and points to a chair.
        Please be seated. Please. I'll fetch the kids
        for you.

                                                           89

She leaves the room. The schoolteacher remains standing.
Waiting.
Finally, the pastor's wife comes back with the two
children.
         MARIE and MARTIN: Good evening, Sir.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening.
PAUSE.
         THE PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to sit down?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (who hasn't thought of it): Yes.
        Perhaps. With pleasure.
They   sit   down.   The  children   sit  opposite   the
schoolteacher.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: Can I offer you something? ,
        (smiling faintly): A cup of coffee? Like during
        the piano lessons
First the schoolteacher wants to refuse, then he decides
to accept so as to get rid of the woman, and be alone
with the children.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, with pleasure. That's very
        kind of you.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: I'll be back in a minute.
The schoolteacher turns to the children:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you know that the Doctor was
        leaving Eichwald?
Short PAUSE.
        MARIE: No.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: But you don't seem surprised at
         my question.
         MARIE: Our mother told us when she came to fetch
         us.
         SCHOOLTEACHER:   And   Xenia   didn't    tell    you
         anything about it?
        MARIE: No.
She looks at Martin who confirms it:
        MARTIN: No.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (incredulously): Not a word? It's
         very unusual for a child not to tell his
         classmates before going away on a trip.
         MARIE (unimpressed):   Xenia   never    talks   much
         about home.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, that's something completely
         different?!

                                                                90

Apparently Marie doesn't take it as a further question,
and remains silent.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I get the feeling you're hiding
        something from me.
         MARIE: What?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's what I'd really like to
        know.
SILENCE. Then the schoolteacher turns to Martin:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: When you were looking for Hansi a
        while ago, what did you want from him?
Short PAUSE.
        MARIE : We were worried. He's ill.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm asking Martin.
PAUSE.
        MARTIN: Yes. He isn't well. And since his mother
        is gone... we thought, we should go and pay him
        a visit.
The schoolteacher realizes that he won't get any further
this way.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you ever ask yourselves who
        could have treated Hansi that way?
PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher adds:
        And Sigi?
PAUSE.
        And who tied the wire in the doctor's garden?
        And who set fire to the barn?
        Well?!
PAUSE.
        MARIE: Yes, of course we wondered.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?
        MARIE: We discussed it with Father. He said it
        must be a sick person.
PAUSE. The schoolteacher doesn't know how to go on.
        SCHOOLTEACHER:    Sigi   was    with    you at
        Thanksgiving. And so was Hansi.
PAUSE.
        MARIE: I don't understand.
With demonstrative helplessness she looks at the
schoolteacher, then at her brother, and again at the
schoolteacher: Shaking her head and shrugging her
shoulders.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What did they do to you?
         MARIE (doesn't seem to understand): Who?

                                                           91

         SCHOOLTEACHER: Sigi and Hansi?
         MARIE (as above): Why?
         SCHOOLTEACHER:   They    obviously   were   being
         punished. For what?
         MARIE (as above): I don't know.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Liesl foresaw that Hansi would be
         punished? What for?
         MARIE (as above): I don't know.
PAUSE.
         Why do you ask us?
PAUSE.
         SCHOOLTEACHER:   You're  an   intelligent   girl,
         Marie. Don't try and play dumb.
PAUSE.
         MARIE: I don't understand you, Sir. You should
         talk with Father about this or with Mother.
         Shall I go get her?

The schoolteacher looks at her.
        MARIE: Martin, would you please get her?
Martin gets up and is about to go to the door.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Stay here, Martin: I'll talk to
        your parents when I consider it's the right
        time. Now, I'm talking to you. And I expect you
        tell me the truth.
Martin sits down after exchanging a glance with Marie
again.
        Where were you on the evening Hansi was found?
         MARIE (doesn't seem to understand): At home.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I mean after the confirmation?
At that moment, the pastor's wife enters with the coffee
cups on a tray.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: There we are. The coffee will be
        ready in a minute.
She puts the tray on the table. Turns to the
schoolteacher, friendly as ever:
        Were the children able to help you?
The schoolteacher looks at Marie, then he answers:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm afraid not. They don't know
        anything, either.
         PASTOR'S WIFE: That's really odd. A doctor can't
         vanish into thin air. What about his patients?

                                                             92

        (to the children) Didn't his daughter tell you
        anything at school?
The schoolteacher gets up, ready to leave.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: No. I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
       PASTOR'S WIFE: Why don't you stay? My husband
       will be back any moment, and the coffee is
       almost ready.
       SCHOOLTEACHER: That's very kind of you, but I'm
       really worried about the midwife's son.
       PASTOR'S WIFE: And she didn't say when she'd be
       back?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I didn't ask her. She caught me
        off guard. She was completely panicked.
The pastor's wife shakes her head thoughtfully.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: Strange... Wait a second! I think
        that's my husband.
And indeed, outside one can hear the FRONT DOOR and then
the STEPS of the pastor. The wife goes to the door to
open it. The pastor appears.
        PASTOR (surprised to see the schoolteacher):
        Good evening.
       PASTOR'S WIFE: Good evening. The schoolteacher
       has been anxiously waiting for you.
       PASTOR (to the schoolteacher): Yes?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes. I'd like to have a quick
        chat with you.
The pastor doesn't really understand what can be so
urgent, and why the schoolteacher, which was unusual for
him, came to see him in the evening. But he remains
friendly:
        PASTOR: Please. We'd better go to my study. It's
        quieter there.
The schoolteacher nods to the pastor's wife, who is glad
that the required meeting can now take place, while the
pastor walks ahead with an inviting gesture. As the
pastor opens the door of the STUDY, he asks:
        PASTOR: Well, how can I help you?
They enter the room and the pastor offers the
schoolteacher a chair. Then he realizes that the windows
are open and closes them, as the schoolteacher starts to
speak.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I spoke to the midwife today: she
        said she now knew who tortured her son.
       PASTOR ("who"?): She does?

                                                           93

       SCHOOLTEACHER: She'll only     tell   the   police.
       That's why she went to town.
       PASTOR (doesn't quite understand        what    the
       schoolteacher is getting at): Well?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: She left the boy behind alone and
       has locked the whole house.
       PASTOR: Locked it?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (nods): I went to the doctor's
        next door to ask him what was going on, whether
        he was taking care of the child or... But
        there's a piece of paper saying that the
        practice is closed until further notice. The
        doctor and his children have disappeared.
The pastor has almost finished closing the windows. He
pauses and turns to the schoolteacher:
        PASTOR (stunned): What do you mean?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (shrugs): I don't know. I thought
        you might have been informed. That's why I'm
        here.
After a startled PAUSE the pastor shakes his head:
        PASTOR: I have no idea.
He   finishes  closing   the  windows.   Then   he  goes
thoughtfully over to the schoolteacher and sits down in
front of him.
        PASTOR: Xenia... Wasn't his daughter in school?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, she was. She never mentioned
        anything.
SILENCE. The pastor ponders. Then, after a while
        SCHOOLTEACHER : I asked Marie and Martin. They
        both know nothing either.
        PASTOR   (looks   up   to    the  schoolteacher,
        "stunned"): Why should they?
The schoolteacher almost dodges speaking further:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. When I went to the
        midwife's place, they were there with a few
        others in the garden.
       PASTOR ("doesn't understand"): To do what?!
       SCHOOLTEACHER: They were looking for the boy.
       PASTOR (as before): Why?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: They wanted to help him.
       PASTOR: So what

                                                             94

         SCHOOLTEACHER (hesitates, then says): I don't
         know how to say it. I have the feeling they're
         hiding something.
         PASTOR (refuses): What?
         SCHOOLTEACHER (keeps on searching hesitantly for
         his words): I don't know. (finally he dares to
         come out with his suspicion): When the doctor
         had his accident... last year, you remember,
         Suddenly the children were in his garden.
         Supposedly, in order to help Xenia.
        PASTOR (doesn't understand): Yes... and?
The schoolteacher, uneasy, breathes hard. He knows that
his suspicions will seem odd, and senses that the pastor
won't go along with then.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Nothing. I had forgotten it.
        Today, it came back to my mind again.
         PASTOR (as before): I don't understand.
PAUSE.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: When they found the Baron's
        son... the last time he had been seen, he was
        with the children.
The pastor looks at the schoolteacher, then his face
slowly freezes to a mask of refusal:
        PASTOR: What are you getting at?
Of course, the schoolteacher notices the reaction. But
he has already gone too far to backtrack. After a PAUSE
he goes on:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: A couple of days before Hansi was
        almost beaten to death, the steward's daughter
        had predicted precisely that to me. Supposedly,
        she had dreamed it. The police thinks she's
        lying. Who told her about it? Who announced it
        to her?
LONG SILENCE. Finally, the pastor gets up, takes a few
steps, then, after another PAUSE, turns again to the
schoolteacher. His face is ashen, and he can hardly
speak:
        PASTOR: If I understand you correctly, you're
        saying that your pupils, my children included,
        committed these crimes. Is that right?
The schoolteacher has little affirmative and regretful
gesture. He feels extremely uncomfortable in this role.
Another PAUSE. Then, the pastor continues:
        Do you realize what you're saying?
PAUSE. He breathes heavily, tries to control his
emotions.
        Do you know...
                                                            95

His voice fails. His chin starts to shake, tears flood
his eyes, and he suddenly turns away.
The schoolteacher who has been looking at him, now looks
down and stays where he is without saying a word.
After a while, the pastor has regained enough control of
himself to turn back to the schoolteacher:
        I assume that I'm the first person to whom
        you've uttered this monstrosity.
Mute reaction of the schoolteacher ("of course").
        If you ever dare to bother other people with it,
        if you publicly denounce respectable families
        and their children in this abject way, I shall
        make sure -- and you can take my word for it --
        that you will go to prison.
The schoolteacher wants to reply something, but the
pastor continues:
        I've seen quite a lot during my work as a
        pastor, but I've never come across anything as
        repulsive as this.
He looks at the schoolteacher for a moment with disdain:

       One can tell that you have no children.
       Otherwise,   you    wouldn't   stoop   to   such
       viciousness. You have a sick mind. I wonder how
       the school authorities could let you loose among
       those poor creatures. I'll have a word with the
       authorities at the proper time.
       And now please leave my house. I never want to
       see you here again.


                            


74. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE EXT/DAY
The steward, his wife and the schoolteacher try to break
into the house.
First the steward tries several keys. As this doesn't
work, they break down a door at the rear of the house
and go in.
        NARRATOR: The midwife never came back. I waited
        until the morning, two days later. Then, I went
        to the manor house to inform the Baron. He
        referred me to the steward and said to open the
        house immediately and to look after the disabled
        boy.


                            

75. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE INT/DAY
BACK TO THE SCENE.
                                                           96

The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife search
through the house. Because of the closed shutters, its
rooms are veiled in half-light. Several times they call
"Hansi"!, "Hello, Hansi, where are you"?, which can
faintly be heard under the narrator's voice.
In the midwife's bedroom, the schoolteacher notices a
photo: it shows the doctor, an unknown woman, and Xenia
as a small girl.
The boy is nowhere to be found.
        NARRATOR: I had never come to the midwife's
        house and felt uncomfortable at the idea of
        barging into somebody else's house without
        asking. It was strange, but we were still
        seeking and calling out anxiously Hansi's name,
        and I already knew, that we were searching in
        vain. Anyone who knew the midwife also knew how
        devoted she was to her disabled child, and that
        she would never have left her wounded Hansi all
        alone.
The three searchers, who have found nothing, meet again
in the stairwell.


                            


76. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE EXT/DAY
The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife come out
from behind the house, leave the property and go their
separate ways on the street. All that is left is the
empty house with its closed shutters.

       NARRATOR: During the next few weeks, the village
       gossip-factory worked overtime.
       Some claimed, the doctor was Hansi's father. He
       and the midwife had tried to abort the child so
       that the shame of their relationship wouldn't be
       found out, and that's how the child became
       disabled. Others even went as far as to claim
       that there was something fishy about the death
       of the doctor's wife, and that they wouldn't be
       surprised, if the two weren't responsible for
       it.


                            

77. MONTAGE: EXT/DAY
The houses of the doctor, the pastor, the farmer, the
street before the school, the estate's administrative
buildings and the manor house.
There is nobody to be seen.

       NARRATOR: Whoever had lynched the boy obviously
       knew about the hidden crimes of his parents.
                                                          97

       Suddenly it seemed even possible that the doctor
       and the midwife, as potential murderers, were
       also the perpetrators of all the other crimes.
       It was suspected, that the doctor had wanted to
       spare his legitimate children and himself public
       disclosure of his guilt, and had therefore fled
       with them. Apparently he had taken the disabled
       boy with him out of guilt. Understandably
       enough, he had left behind his accomplice and
       the mother of the disgraced child.
       The fact that it was on a bicycle that she tried
       to catch up with the man who had happily
       escaped, was the cause of a great deal of
       laughter.

The deserted estate is decorated with flags.
        On July 28th Austria declared war on Serbia. It
        was followed on Saturday, August 1rst, by the
        German declaration of war on Russia, and on
        France the following Monday.




                            


  78.CHURCH INT/DAY

HIGH ANGLE SHOT:
The villagers are about to take their seats. The smaller
children are sitting with their parents on the pews.
All are in their Sunday best, the members of the militia
are in uniform. Flags are planted. Joyful excitement
reigns everywhere.
Once the church is full, the Baron, the Baroness and
their son Sigi walk down the aisle and sit down in the
front row.

       NARRATOR: On the Sunday between those dates, the
       whole village came to the festive service.
       An atmosphere of expectation and departure was
       in the air. From now on nothing would be the
       same.
       Only a few days ago everybody would have called
       the life they lived as God's will, worthy of
       being lived, and would have shunned any change.
       The strange joy with which the coming war was
       greeted, showed that this certainty of order and
       security was based on very shaky foundations.

CLOSE-UPS:
Of all the adult leading characters of the film, aside
from the doctor and the midwife. Also of Eva and her
father.
                                                           98

       In the frenzy of patriotic enthusiasm that was
       flaring up, the events that had shaken Eichwald,
       had become an irrelevant.
       In the face of the coming war, Eva's father had
       taken his daughter back and, at her pleading,
       had come to Eichwald to cast an eye at the place
       where his future son-in-law was living and
       working. The prospect, that I might soon call
       this beloved creature my wife, turned this day
       also into a solemn day for me.
       The pastor never mentioned our conversation
       again. Our relationship was limited to what was
       required professionally. He apparently never
       went through with his threat to denounce me to
       the school-authorities.

MORE CLOSE-UPS.
The schoolteacher on the gallery lifts his hands and
cues them to begin. They start SINGING. We see them one
after the other. At the end we see Marie: she wears the
white ribbon in her hair.

       Today, more than a quarter of a century later,
       toward the end of my life, and several years
       after the end of a second war that was to change
       this world in a more cruel and radical way than
       the first one, the one we faced at the time, I
       wonder if the events of those days and our
       silence about them, weren't the germ of the
       tragedy toward which we were heading.
       Didn't we all know secretly what had happened in
       our midst? Hadn't we, in a way, made it possible
       by closing our eyes? Didn't we keep our mouths
       shut because otherwise we would have had to
       wonder if the misdeeds of these children, of our
       children, weren't actually the result of what
       we'd been teaching them?

The image of Marie singing with the shining white ribbon
freezes.

       I was drafted at the start of the third year of
       the war. After the war, I sold the house in
       Grundbach that I had inherited from my father,
       who had died in the meantime, and with the money
       I opened a tailor's shop in the town, where I
       still live now.
       I never saw anybody from the village again.

Over the FREEZE FRAME the END CREDITS begin. Once the
narrator's VOICE has gone silent, we listen to Bach's
solemn chorale. The children sing beautifully.

          Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white
          wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.
          
          CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged
          peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist'
          of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting
          ice.
          
          STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt
          crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat

          beauty, then...

          A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather
          gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface
          with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops
          out --
          
          -- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death.
          It's a man.
          
          Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have
          snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted
          -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and
          spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with
          startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.
          
          We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre
          shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE
          PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling
          white.

          The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades

          Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants --
          rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but
          she's not at the beach.
          
          In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY
          OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's
          got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels
          above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm
          tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the
          earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world.
          
          The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK
          (20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel
          shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the
          intrusion.
          
                                     JAMIE
                       Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein

          Jamie leaves.
          
          As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her,
          panning around the small office. Half-packed up boxes
          lay strewn about the floor.

          A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk. Each day has
          been marked off with a large X. THREE DAYS REMAIN
          unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the
          space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical
          beach.
          
          A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized
          with dart holes over the Bullseye. It's of a candy-
          striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by
          international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing
          next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with
          SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his
          face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.

          We PICK UP CARRIE AND FOLLOW her as she strides down the
          icy, unmade street. Her hood is pulled up and she's not
          enjoying the cold. She reaches a row of buildings and
          checks the names - GEOLOGY LAB #2...ASTROPHYSICS -

                    you to read something for me.
          
          She pulls out a small LEATHER FOLD chained around her
          neck. Opens it up. Puts it in front of his face.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    What's this say?
          
          He's not sure what she's getting at --
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    C'mon, go ahead, read it.

                    United States Marshal.
          
          She closes the fold, lets it drop around her neck.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Very good.
                         (BEAT)
                    Now are you still sure you want to
                    report the theft of an illegal
                    narcotic?
          
          He actually ponders the question for a moment. Carrie
          puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away
          from the others.

                     Professor...are you planning on
                     doing the winter-over?
          
                                   SAPPERSTEIN
                     Not this year, no.
          
                                  CARRIE
                     Good. And how are you feeling
                     right now?
          
                                    SAPPERSTEIN
                     You think I'm crazy? Is that what
                     you're saying?

                          (PACIFYING)
                     No, no, not crazy. But this time
                     of year, down here, we're all
                     going a little toasty aren't we?
                     How about you plant a little
                     Cannabis when you get home?
          
          She pats him on the back.
          
          
          INT.   MARSHAL'S OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY
          
          Carrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is
          about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection --
          what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right
          temple.
          
          She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is
          bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'.
          
          She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of
          empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN:
          None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with
          "Theft of botany sample." And "None."
          
          A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces.
          Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up.
          Just stares unhappily at the binder.
          
          Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the
          cardboard tiles.
          
          She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a
          row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform
          graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other
          girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday
          cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere,
          sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm.

          CONTINUED:
          
          As she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a
          nearby box --
          
                                      MURPHY (O.C.)
                       You busy?
          
          She turns to see SAM MURPHY, base commander, the guy on
          the DART BOARD. There's an awkward beat.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       What do you think?
                            (BEAT)
                       I know you weren't in the area.
                       What's up?
          
          He sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to
          it.
          
                                     MURPHY
                       I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he
                       spotted a popsicle out on the ice.
          
                                      CARRIE
                       What flavor?
          
                                      MURPHY
                       Don't know.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       And we were doing so well.

          This throws her.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       McClain Valley? What was he doing
                       out there? That's no man's land.
          
          He takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems
          amused.
          
                                     MURPHY
                       I've got a plane heading to ASB in
                       an hour with some supplies for
                       Winter-over.

          The red and white striped ceremonial south "pole" stands

           opulation: 183                Temperature: - 55°
          
          Ice as far as the eye can see. In the background is the
          base. It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen
          specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings
          raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular
          shaped walkways.
          
          Off in the distance -- A SNOWCAT mounted with a plow,
          pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a LARGE
          BERM. It's been busy -- SEVERAL OTHER BERMS flank both
          sides of the runway.
          
          Camera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she
          deplanes a LC-130. A HALF-DOMED HANGAR rises up on the
          other side of the plane.
          
          The main ASB complex is before her.
          
          Across the top of the entrance is a huge poster: 3 DAYS
          TO WINTER-OVER EVAC. Piles of packed equipment are
          everywhere.
          
          Half a dozen NAKED MEN wearing only boots and face masks
          blow out the front door screaming and yelling, run around
          the South Pole, right past her, and back into ASB.
          
          Carrie heads in --

          Music cranks. Carrie knows her way. People come and go
          as she strides along a corridor decorated with PARTY
          BALLOONS and signs that read: `DON'T FORGET THE EVE OF
          EVAC PARTY' -- comes to an office door with a small
          plaque on it that reads: MARSHAL. Pushes it open.
          
          
          INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie enters. It's smaller than her McMurdo office with
          a HOLDING ROOM that has a viewing window in the door. A
          fine layer of dust blankets a little desk with a computer
          and lamp on top.
          
          A map of Antarctica is spread across a wall with sub-
          station positions marked in block letters. A window
          gives view to the South Pole.
          
          
          INT. SMALL ROOM - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie opens the door. Single bed. Tiny dresser. No
          frills. She tosses her gear bag onto the bed. Closes
          the door.
          
          
          INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - DAY
          
          Carrie pokes her head in. An examination table, cabinets
          with drugs and first aid equipment. A couple of hospital
          beds. Moving boxes are packed up.
          
                                   CARRIE
                     Doc?
          
          Another door in the back of the room is open, but the
          light is off. Carrie turns to leave and --

          outside, Aussie RUSSELL KELLER (late 20's) coming down
          the corridor. He's naked, except for a towel wrapped
          around his waste. Sports a goatee. Couple tats.
          Flashes a cocky smile.
          
                                   KELLER

                       It's his first year down here.
                       You know how that goes. My bet it
                       was just debris, an old tent or
                       something.

                       stay here with me and we'll party,
                       just the two of us. Put those

          He looks at Carrie, all bundled up.

                       Then why are you down here?
          
          Carrie's eyes drift out the window --

                       We all make stupid mistakes.
          
          Delfy tips the nose of the plane down. The ice below is
          broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses.

                       It's right up here.
          
          He spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor.
          Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways --
          Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction.

          He banks the plane and slips down into a valley.

                       alright.
          
          Down below is the body sprawled on the icy ground next to
          the crevice.

          EXT. ICE FIELD - LATER
          
          The Twin Otter is in the distant background. Carrie, Doc
          and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder,
          weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small
          crevasses. Mid-conversation...

                       can't find him, but we hear him on
                       the radio going on and on about
                       the Serengeti heat and his wife,
                       Janet. Next day, we find him
                       frozen solid, wearing nothing but
                       his bunny boots.
          
          Delfy stops.    Grimaces.    Drops the gear bag.

          The CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death.
          
          They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the
          spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous.

          Carrie moves up to it. Takes a look down the deep
          crevice four feet away. Can't see the bottom. She walks
          around to get a look at the face. Blanches slightly.

          Carrie pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA from a pocket.     Shoots
          a couple of pics.
          
          Doc takes a look up behind them. The ice steepens
          sharply to a vast plateau, scattered with jagged boulders
          of ice.

          Delfy, who looks very uneasy about all this, grabs the
          feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm.

          The festive mood evaporates quickly as all eyes stay
          glued to the horrific state of Weiss' body.
          
          Just as they pass OPERATIONS, Rhonda steps out with the
          Brazilian and French Newbies at her side to see what's

          CU ON CARRIE'S HAND TUGGING ON THE ZIPPER
          
          Little by little, it starts to move -- then finally,
          ZIIIIIIIIIIP. The jacket opens up, barely -- like sliced
          skin.
          
          Doc watches as she tries to pry it open further, but
          can't.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Grab that side.
          
          She takes one half, he the other, and begin to pull. The
          jacket opens up, like bending metal -- slowly revealing a
          frozen, but extremely bloodsoaked chest area surrounding
          A DEEP PUNCTURE WOUND through the shirt.
          
          Doc's face sags.    Carrie stares at the wound.

          Carrie steps out into the hallway. Takes a moment,
          leaning against the wall, this whole thing wearing on her
          more than she's revealed. She tilts her head back. The
          second it hits the wall --
          
          THE SOUND OF A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!

          Carrie's beat to shit, soul weary. She's on her knees,
          full of blood. A man is on the floor between two beds
          before her. She holds her gun at her side. He's dead.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Carrie refocuses.   Pulls away from the wall.    Leaves the

          Carrie has a NEXTEL phone/walkie to her ear, making her
          way up the corridor. Moves past a couple of guys loading
          a dolly with boxes from an adjacent room.

          She hangs up. Approaches a closed door.      Name plate on
          it reads Dinkle -- SUB-STATIONS MANAGER.
          
          O.C. MOANING and GROANING -- great sex. Carrie rolls her
          eyes. Knocks on the door. No one answers. Moaning
          continues. She doesn't have time for this. Opens the
          door to see --
          
          -- a large TV playing a locker-room porno where a
          quarterback with no pants is giving it to a cheerleader

          standing there, CHEER the action.

          Small room. English flag. There's a Beckham poster and
          an 8x10 framed photo, turned backwards, hanging on one
          wall. A large map of Antarctica on another.
          
          A proud assortment of tea bags are uniformly lined up

          Three photos are stapled inside. One is of Weiss, the

          Carrie walks in. Rhonda has a phone to one ear, another
          in her hand. Looks stressed. She's hovering over one of
          the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen
          displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler.
          His focus is on a VAST STORM SYSTEM that is heading
          toward ASB, which is marked in RED NEON. Other stations
          are marked as well.

          doesn't like it.

          Carrie and Delfy, wearing full ECW gear, lean hard into

          Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel-
          lock in the center of the door.
          
          WHAM! The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp,
          slamming open against the building. Wind knocks her
          back.
          
          The storm sings in an even DULL ROAR. A solid white wall
          of wind-driven ice blows past. The light is oddly dim.
          
          CRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in
          half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls
          across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor.
          
          Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot
          tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to
          the side of the building.
          
          She steps into the storm.

          Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking
          the wheel.
          
          Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is
          gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide
          line and the ROAR of the storm.
          
          A gust of wind lifts her off the ground.     She's caught by
          her tether and smacked down on the ice.
          
          Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally
          Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to
          realize she's at a building.
          
          She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening
          the door.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the
          HOWLING behind her. Pulls off her mask. Teeth are
          chattering.
          
          She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the
          ready room into the building.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie hits the lights: nothing. No power. Just a
          sliver of light stabbing in through a window.
          
                                  CARRIE
                         (calling out)
                    Mooney? Hello?
          
          Only silence responds.
          
          The hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in
          both directions. She draws a flashlight from her pocket.
          Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark.
          
          Something doesn't feel right. Slides her baton out from
          her belt. She decides to go left.
          
          Walking the hall, she tries door after door.   Finally one
          gives.
          
                                   CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Mooney?
          
          She cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an
          empty room.
          
          Moves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING, like
          someone trying to clear their throat.
          
          Looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a
          closed door at the end of the hall.
          
          It's confirmed when she hears it again.
          
          Stops at the door.
          
          She slowly opens it --
          
          Now she can hear HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING --
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                35.
          CONTINUED:
          
          -- Sweeps the inside with her light. It's a large lounge
          type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned
          sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's
          coming from. Another cough.
          
          She enters the room.
          
          
          INSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Inching forward, she gets to the sofa. Looks over it to
          see A BODY -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood.
          Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his
          esophagus.
          
                                    CARRIE
                       ...My God.
          
          She goes to him. As she kneels, he grabs her, GASPING
          for air, trying to tell her something.
          
          Carrie catches a REFLECTION OF MOMENT behind her in his
          eyes -- someone's coming at her.
          
          -- She instinctively rolls back over Mooney just as --
          WHAM! An ICE AXE swings down at her. Just misses her
          head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the
          baton that goes clattering across the floor.
          
          The killer, wearing ECW gear with hood and goggles, takes
          another swing. She lunges to the side. Axe misses her,
          but sinks into Mooney. Game over for him.
          
          Carrie slices the floor with her light, looking for the
          baton, but can't see it.
          
          The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts
          around the sofa, heading back out the door.
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run,
          retracing her steps. Her light zigzags. The killer
          emerges a few beats later on a run. It's going to be
          close.
          
          Halfway down the hall, she hangs a hard right toward the
          Ready Room. Throws a glance over her shoulder -- he's
          right behind.
          
          She targets the ready room door -- the orb of her light
          getting smaller and smaller as she nears.
          
                                                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Gets there.   Doesn't even want to look back -- it's all
          or nothing.   She pulls open the door --
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- Leaping in, she spins the wheel-lock closed.
          
          SMACK!   The killer HITS THE DOOR from the other side.
          
          She SPINS OPEN the outside door wheel-lock, as the lock
          on the INNER DOOR behind her starts SPINNING OPEN at the
          same time. It's a race.
          
          CARRIE'S door slams open first and the wind hits her
          hard.
          
          She pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind
          her bursts open.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm
          line and clipping in as she staggers forward. Glancing
          back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses
          sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout.
          
          She struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but
          HER HAND ON THE LINE moves erratically -- He's on.
          
          She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer
          materializing out of the whiteout right behind her.    He's
          clipped into Carrie's line. He raises the axe.
          
          He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the
          ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her,
          raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his
          knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.
          
          He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off.
          She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.
          
          The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking
          kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.
          
          SOUND FADES from Carrie's world.
          
          There is nothing but her strained BREATHING.   The killer
          draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood.   He swings.
          
          Carrie UNCLIPS her harness from the tether. THE WIND
          grabs her, and Carrie SLIDES AWAY -- the killer
          disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Sliding across the ice, Carrie SLAMS into a pole.   Grabs
          on.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - POLE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cinching her hood down, she searches the storm with no
          idea which way to go.
          
          Carrie glances up the post. Barely visible through the
          blowing ice are signs pointing different directions:
          "Moscow 17,030 Tokyo 13,329 Fiji 7,877 Los Angeles
          15,641"
          
          She pulls herself up and heads out, leaning into the
          wind. Carrie staggers blindly, trying to protect her
          face. Falling, she gets up, and struggles on.
          
          Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat.
          A rope catches her in the neck. It's another storm line.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - SECOND LINE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm.
          
          Finally, she bumps into something. It moves. It turns
          to face her. IT'S THE KILLER AGAIN. He swings. She
          deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab
          the axe head. The killer tears the axe free, taking
          Carrie's glove with it.
          
          He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope,
          throwing him off balance.
          
          The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the
          ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as
          Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a
          pendulum.
          
          The line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop. It takes
          everything she's got to get to her feet. She slowly
          struggles up the line.
          
          
          EXT/INT. STORAGE SHED - CONTINUOUS
          
          More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door
          and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands.
          
          Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around
          the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives.
          
          
                                                        (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          The door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's
          caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal.
          
          Ripping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind.
          
          Carrie falls, collapsing against the door.       Blackout
          
                                                            SMASH CUT TO
          
          
          INT. MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)
          
          A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto
          Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself
          in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge
          dangles around her neck.   Wears a shoulder harness. The
          bathroom door behind her is open.
          
          She catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the
          room behind her. Body tenses.
          
          As she turns --
          
                                      CARRIE
                       Jack?
          
          No answer.
          
          She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the
          door.
          
          Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM!
          Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the
          other door jam.
          
          Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven,
          grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the
          bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into
          the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She
          drops to the floor --
          
          CARRIE'S POV - A BLURRY FIGURE stands over top of her.
          She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a
          frenzy, like a cat in water.
          
                                      CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Jack!
          
                                      DELFY O.C.
                       Wo wo wo.   It's okay, it's okay.
          
          The figure materializes around her.     It's Delfy, holding
          her down.

          Carrie slowly settles, then she's out again.

          INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - VOSTOK - LATER
          
          She's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. An old,
          WRINKLED FACED RUSSIAN MAN slowly lowers her wounded hand
          -- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of
          water next to her. Her silver ring glistens under the
          florescent lights. A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       What happened?

                       When   you didn't come back -- we
                       went   looking for you. Found a
                       dead   guy in the other building --
                       that   Mooney?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Yeah. Someone got to him before I
                       did. Then went after me.
                            (BEAT)
                       How long was I out?

                       A couple hours.
          
          Carrie's eyes drift to the old man next to her.
          
                                     DELFY (cont'd)
                       He's been looking after you.
          
          He flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Thanks.
          
          As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in
          Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling
          something else.
          
          She sits up. Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers
          are slow moving.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)

          Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the
          dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her
          bearings back.
          
                                  DELFY
                    Whoever it was, could have flown
                    out after the storm broke.
          
          They walk a few silent beats, then --
          
                                     DELFY (cont'd)
                    Who's Jack?
          
          It's a moment before she responds --
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Let it go, Delfy.
          
          He lets it go.
          
          THEY ENTER THE LOUNGE
          
          Same as before. Carrie goes to the over-turned sofa.
          Moves her light around -- searching. Passes over the
          blood on the floor.
          
                                  DELFY
                    Until I met you, I hadn't seen any
                    dead people. Now I'm at two.
          
          Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa.
          Low angles her light. Something reflects.    Reaches in.
          Retrieves her baton --
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal
          vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which
          bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall.
          
          Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth
          - Shhhhh.
          
          She instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but
          it hurts. She shifts it to the other.
          
          She turns off her light.    Delphy does the same.   Motions
          for him to stay put.

          CONTINUED:
          
          She heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her
          back tight to the wall.
          
          Gets to the edge of the door.      It's open just slightly --
          looks in.
          
          Sees a man in an ECW jacket with his back to her, holding
          a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag
          with his other. Items are strewn. Another bag has been
          completely turned inside out.
          
          She enters.    Baton cocked.

                       Unless you want your head cracked,
                       I wouldn't move.
          
          His body tenses.

          He does. He's a guy in his 30's. Although he's clean
          shaven, there's a rugged edge about him.

                    If they've been digging out there,

          pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses
          her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't
          move. She pulls at it...
          
          ...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is
          soaked in blood.   No corpse.

          Delfy's drawn to a BIZARRE LOOKING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT;
          it's a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower.
          A circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box.

          Carrie has Mooney's bodybag unzipped and is examining his
          left leg. No cuts. No blood. She thinks on this non-
          discovery for a moment, then zips it back up.

          Pryce is in the backseat, Delfy is driving. Carrie is
          next to him with the map and her GPS in hand. She stares

          entrance.
          
          Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations,
          watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by
          two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears.
          
          She's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the
          door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are
          loading a body under a sheet into the back of their
          truck.

          steps away from the Cat. Pryce does too.
          
          Her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal.    It's

          Carrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat.
          Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then,
          she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN.
          
          Kneels to the ice. Scoops some up. Checks it out.
          Perplexed. Pryce approaches from behind.

          She gets to her feet. Walks further -- her eyes now
          paying close attention to the texture of the ice. After
          a dozen steps, texture changes. Ice is now smooth --
          like it's supposed to be.
          
          She turns around.   Tries to get the bigger picture.
          Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large
          area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few
          inches thick --

                       They were digging, Pryce. And
                       they tries to spread the ice to
                       hide it.
          
          She heads back across the area.       Scans the horizon.
          Takes another step forward.
          
          WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below
          the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was
          covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.
          
          Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating
          slightly, unsure of their own footing.
          
          Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is
          precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a
          slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece
          of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to
          hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but
          darkness.

          He gets closer.   Closer.    Moves to within an inch from
          hers --
          
          -- She SLIPS.    Falls away.   Things become silent.

                    Carrie?    Can you hear me?
          
          Delfy peers over Pryce's shoulder into the abyss.

                    Saw a rope in the Cat.
          
          Delfy springs to his feet.
          
          
          INT. ICE SHAFT - SAME
          
          Darkness. A flashlight clicks on. Reflects off a wall
          of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. Carrie gets
          to her feet. Sees that she's in a small dug out area.
          
          As she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls
          on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind, maybe three feet high.
          
          Carrie shines the light to her feet.        The ground beneath
          her is metal.
          
          
          INT. ICE SHAFT - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a
          rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits.
          Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery.
          
          Carrie moves over to the hatch. Pulls on it. Opens
          easily. She and Pryce hit the interior with their
          lights. Find themselves staring into...AN AIRPLANE!
          
          
          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Off their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice
          crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except
          for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out -- they
          go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness. Place is
          tomb silent.

          CONTINUED:
          Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at
          odd angles -- victims of an intense IMPACT. The plane is
          pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious.

                       It's an Antanov-74. Russian made -
                       - late fifties. No one's put
                       these in the air for forty years.
          
          Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness,
          heading for the cockpit.
          
          Something BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light -
          - which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position -
          - as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past
          the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man
          staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's
          dead, pinned between two large metal crates.
          
          Delfy stands still. Staring.           Carrie throws a look back
          over her shoulder --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Guess that makes three.
          
          She continues on with Delfy staying close.         Her light
          targets the cockpit door. It's closed.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie pushes the door open.
          
          The beam of her light reveals frozen blood SPLATTERED
          across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding
          through it.
          
          Continues over three dead men in flight suits still
          strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly
          expressions perfectly preserved. Each have a sidearm
          holstered around their waist.
          
                                     DELFY
                       This isn't funny --
          
          She looks back to Delfy -- gets confused.

          Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb
          through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered
          cargo area.
          
          Ransacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle
          of ropes and crampons, old ECW gear, and boxes of
          supplies.
          
          Dipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free,
          sniffs, and drinks.
          
                                    CARRIE

                    Vodka.
          
          Carrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM
          flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS
          TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION.
          
          Spots Pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead.

                    Find what you're looking for?
          
          Her light hits Pryce, who is focused on a HEAVY STEEL
          CAGE WELDED INTO THE AIRFRAME. Incredibly strong. And
          inside it is a STEEL SAFE. Door is open.
          
          Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Just answers.

                    And by the looks of that safe,
                    must've been transporting
                    something pretty important.
          
          Carrie moves in closer.   Sees that the cage has been
          breached.

          Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this
          weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous
          intruders until they forced an opening. Discarded tools
          litter the floor.

                       They put some serious work into
                       this.
          
          There's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where
          one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered
          in blood --

                       Whoever got hurt, they dragged him
                       out of here. There's blood all
                       over the tunnel.
          
          She uses her light to examine the interior of the safe
          more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX
          ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed.
          Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide.
          
          The PLANE SUDDENLY TREMBLES.

          CRASHCRASHCRASH!    More ICE.
          
          They scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight
          beams swinging wildly about the hold.
          
          MORE ICE FALLS. It's getting louder as they're getting
          closer to the source.
          
          Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the
          hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely.
          Light fades.

          CHIPCHIPCHIP!    Ice is flying.
          
          Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped
          up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard
          at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled
          hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. Efforts
          are big-- but the progress minimal.

                    hours at the most.
          
          Delfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped

                    this. No way.
          
          The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade.
          Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg,
          trying to get more juice going. Still fading. Light
          goes out --
          
          -- Screen goes black. Can't see a thing. A second
          later, ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it.
          Hands it over to Carrie --

          Delfy looks to them both.    Desperate.

          Pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible
          in the dissipating range of light.
          
          Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a
          pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her
          coat.
          
          Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it,
          but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks.
          Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks.
          
          Pryce comes back with a couple bottles.       Stops dead in
          his tracks.
          
          Carrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS
          attached to the wall near the hatch. He's thinking.
          
          He moves to Carrie --

          He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the
          back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the

                    out hatches.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    We came in through it.
          
          Pryce goes back into the cargo area.
          
                                  PRYCE (O.C.)
                    Has to be more than one.
          
                                  DELFY
                    It'd be on the ceiling in case of
                    an ocean landing.
          
          Carrie watches Pryce's flashlight moving about in the
          cargo area of the aircraft.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Found it!
          
          Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam
          straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the
          fuselage.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    With the angle of the plane, I
                    don't think we're that far from
                    the surface. Give me a hand.
          
          Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over.
          They join, sliding it over below the hatch.
          
          He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    These are explosive bolts. If we
                    blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash
                    a hole up through the ice.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Or, if the ice is too thick the
                    blast will come right back at us.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    We can be blown up, suffocate or
                    freeze to death. Take your pick.
          
          Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch
          area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a
          crisscrossing maze of wires.

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          As he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a
          GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    This could work -- give me the
                    battery from your phone.
          
          As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery.   Hands over
          her phone. He extracts the BATTERY.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    When I connect these two wires,
                    hopefully there's going to be a
                    big bang. May want to take some
                    cover.
          
          Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire
          onto the battery, and prepares for another.
          
          He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against
          the fuselage.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    You guys ready?
          
          Delfy nods.
          
          Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her
          head.
          
          Pryce touches the last wire to the battery.   Nothing
          happens. Hope freezes.
          
          Pryce tries again --
          
          -- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting
          around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet
          coming in and out of their light.
          
          SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on,
          halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's
          width.
          
          They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of
          ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a
          THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift
          from God.
          
                                    DELFY
                    Hallelujah --
          
          Pryce drops down.   Moves to another crate.

                    need to get up higher.
          
          Delfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it
          over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the
          other.
          
          Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing
          Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE.
          
                                     CARRIE
                    Don't move.
          
          Pryce stares at her in disbelief.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    What's going on?
          
                                  DELFY

                    he is.
          
          She reaches into Pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm
          from the shoulder holster.
          
          Switches it with the one in her hand.    Puts the Russian
          gun in her coat pocket.

                    ago, we picked up chatter between
                    someone down here and Tahir
                    Soufian, a black market trader in
                    New York. It was all about
                    setting up a buy for cannisters
                    found in an old Russian transport
                    buried in the ice.

                    There's been rumors for years that
                    the Russians had a second base --
                    a secret weapons research facility
                    under the ice that supposedly blew
                    up in the late sixties -- nothing
                    was ever confirmed.

                    The fact is, before the treaty in
                    `72 they were strip mining all
                    over the place down here -- we
                    believe for uranium and other
                    specialized minerals for weapon's
                    use. It was the Cold War. No one
                    knows half the things the
                    Russian's were up to. This plane
                    could be the link between rumor
                    and truth. And if it is true,
                    what's in those cannisters could
                    be a prelude to another terrorist
                    attack.

          Carrie wrestles with her emotions. She looks back

          floor. Makes a decision.

          They look around. The weather has deteriorated - the sky
          is dark with fast moving clouds. The wind is HOWLING.
          The Snowcat is parked over the hole, blade lowered.

          The gauze finally comes off, revealing her middle TWO

          Carrie sits in sullen silence, the room dark around her.
          The only light bounces in from a sterile, draped area
          where Doc works on her hand. She can't watch as his
          CURVED SUTURE and thread, rises and falls with every
          stitch he makes. Carrie has her attention on BLOODY

          longer, watching the T-shirt absorb the blood around the
          wound. As the stain widens, so does the camera...
          slowly... bringing into picture THE MAN Carrie shot.
          He's wearing a MARSHAL'S BADGE around his neck.

          emotion that's trying to get out.
          
          She finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that
          sweeps the stuff off her bed. Bag and gun go flying.
          
          Carrie slumps to the floor.    Silent tears.
          
          After a beat -- she notices Pryce standing in the doorway
          with some PAPERS in his hand. He's looking at her

          The RADIO on Pryce's hip -- crackles...
          
                                  RHONDA (V.O.)
                    Dinkle, it's Rhonda --
          
          Pryce smirks.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    I better get this back to him.
                    And we have to find Rubin.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Think you can you help me with
                    these buttons, first?
          
                                   PRYCE
                    Sure.
          
          He moves closer.   Starts to button her up.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    For what it's worth -- I think
                    you're pretty tough, Marshall.

          INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters. Light streaming in through the window
          hits her tired face. She reaches for the light switch on
          the nearby wall --
          
          -- A HAND GRABS HERS --
          
          -- AGGRESSIVELY YANKS her away from the open door. It's
          kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's
          embrace. A knife's brought to her neck.
          
                                      MAN
                            (raspy, deep)
                       ...You Stetko?
          
          Carrie nods -- slides her hand toward her pocket...
          
                                        MAN (cont'd)
                       Don't...
          
          She stops.

                       Who are you?
          
          He slowly turns her around to face him.
          
          -- it's Rubin, but he looks beat to shit. Deep cracks
          slice across his bloody, chapped lips. Peeling skin
          flakes on his face. Desperate, despondent eyes. Shaky,
          frostbitten fingers. He's having a hard time holding it
          together as he can barely get the words out...
          
                                     RUBIN
                       -- Did Mooney talk to you? I
                       didn't hear from him -- he was
                       supposed to call me after you
                       talked.
          
          Carrie's confused.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Mooney's dead.
          
          His eyes well.
          
                                        RUBIN
                       No...
          
                                     CARRIE
                       And so's Weiss.

          He nods - he knew.
          
                                     RUBIN
                       And I'm next, I know it.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       It's okay, you're safe, just put
                       the knife down.
          
          His shaking hands slowly lowers it -- she breathes a
          little easier. He sets it down on an empty book shelf
          next to him.

                       cannisters?
          
          He stares off blankly --
          
                                     RUBIN
                       Weiss didn't want to go through
                       with it. Oh God. How did we let
                       this happen?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Rubin -- I need you to focus for
                       me.
          
          He tries. Looks at her through tired, pinched eyes --
          he's trying.
          
          O.C. KNOCK. KNOCK on her door.
          
          Rubin is spooked.    Glares at her -- scared.   Like a caged
          animal.
          
                                     DOC (O.C.)
                       Carrie, it's Doc -- got those
                       painkillers.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       It's okay, he's a doctor, he can
                       help you.
          
          It falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife.    She
          tries to stop him.
          
          Rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair.
          She topples backwards.
          
          He whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder
          into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back
          up against the wall behind him. Takes the wind right out
          of him. Pills all over the floor.

          Rubin dashes off down the hallway -- it's an effort.
          
          Carrie appears at the door. Catches a glimpse of Rubin
          disappearing down a set of side stairs.

          Doc nods.
          
          She takes off after him, pulling her phone off her hip.
          
          AT THE STAIRS
          
          She takes two at a time -- keys the two-way...

                      Rubin's here! He's on the run.

          BOTTOM OF STAIRS - LEVEL ONE
          
          As Carrie comes off the stairs -- looks left -- there's
          three guys carrying boxes out of a room. Snaps a look to
          the right --
          
          -- Rubin's at the far end, slipping through a doorway
          that leads into an INTERCONNECTING TUNNEL to another part
          of ASB.

          Rubin is moving through to a door at the far end as
          Carrie enters. It's lined with several free standing,
          empty bookcases.

          Carrie enters through the connecting tunnel's doorway.
          Not a lot of light. Slows her pace. It's quiet.
          Dormant. Vacant lab stations. Room's been shut down for
          the winter. Eyes scan. Fall upon --
          
          -- A DOOR ACROSS THE ROOM.   A sign above reads: READY
          ROOM.
          
          She takes off again, slaloming her way around the lab
          stations to get to the door.
          
          
          OTHER SIDE OF ROOM
          
          Carrie gets to the door. Pulls on the handle. Won't
          open. Rattles. Looks in through a viewing window --
          sees --
          
          -- a panicked Rubin inside, grabbing ECW gear off a rack
          mounted to the wall.
          
          A DIGITAL READOUT ABOVE THE EXIT DOOR READS: -60.
          
          He and Carrie exchange glances.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Rubin -- I can help you!
          
          He shakes his head.
          
          She tugs harder on the doors. Stuck. Looks through the
          window to see he's tied them together with some climbing
          rope.
          
          In that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods
          half the room as the outside door is whipped open.
          
          A MAN in full ECW - stands in the doorway. He's wearing
          a FACE MASK and GOGGLES. Holds an ICE AXE poised, ready
          to strike -- it's the same guy who attacked her.

          Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and
          Carrie, but --
          
          -- SWOOOSH! THE ICE AXE is buried into his shoulder,
          gaffing him like a fish. The pain's excruciating for
          Rubin, who spins on his attacker like a wild man.
          BULLDOZES into him, driving him back out the door.
          
          Both TUMBLE down a steep set of stairs -- the exposed end
          of the ice axe gets stuck in a step's steel meshing on
          the way down -- rips out of Rubin's shoulder.

          Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet. Takes off.
          Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria.
          Disappears around the contour of ASB before the other guy
          can get to his feet.
          
          His assailant rises. Goes back up a couple steps to
          retrieve his embedded ice axe, but finds it wedged so
          tight, it won't budge. Abandons it.

          Hears FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HER. Turns to see it's Pryce.

          Pryce latches on to a heavy SUPPLY CART filled with
          beakers, micro-scopes and other gear, that's tucked
          against one of the lab stations.

                       Someone's trying to kill him.
          
          Pryce picks up speed as he targets the door. Hits it
          like a freight train, busting it open! Cart goes
          crashing. Contents scatter like buckshot.
          
          
          INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          The two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through

          Carrie immediately closes the outside door. Pryce goes
          for the ECW wear. Scrambles to get a coat on. Carrie
          joins. Same thing.

          from his wound already frozen on his shirt.
          
          The cold -- it's killing him. Body's shaking.    The sun's
          reflection off the ice is blinding.

          shield them -- has little effect.
          
          He looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his
          attacker not far behind.
          
          Rubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his
          fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms
          are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care --
          pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins
          around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground.
          
          Continues to the end of the storage bins. Moves under
          ASB, using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal
          his movement.
          
                                                                   81.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Up ahead -- forty yards away -- hope. He continues
          toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the
          other side, where TWO PEOPLE, CLAD IN ECW are finishing
          filling an insulated container with water from an
          insulated hose mounted to the Melter.   A snowmobile is
          parked next to them.
          
          He tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice
          escapes...
          
                                   RUBIN
                    ...Help me.
          
          The guys -- oblivious.
          
          
          EXT. READY ROOM - STAIRS - DAY
          
          Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room
          and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite
          directions around the complex.
          
          
          EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - SAME
          
          Rubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get
          to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the
          container.   Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too
          slow, they take off. He coughs up blood.
          
                                   RUBIN
                    W..wa..wait.
          
          He turns around to check on his pursuer.   Twenty feet
          away and closing.
          
          Rubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon --
          anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER.
          Heads for it.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME
          
          Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where
          several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow --
          through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF
          RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the
          main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in.
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. ASB - UNDERNEATH - SAME
          
          Pryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support
          leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin.
          Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
          
          Rubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it,
          but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a
          defeated glance over his shoulder to see --
          
          -- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin
          against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on -
          - SPRAYING him head to toe.
          
          Rubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips
          go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff
          steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his
          ice-locked clothing.
          
          The man moves to Rubin.   Grabs his head, and - SNAP -
          breaks his neck.
          
          Rubin's body topples stiffly to the ground.
          
          
          INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - ASB - SAME
          
          Rhonda crosses the busy room. Reaches for a clipboard
          hanging next to the window. Something outside catches
          her attention.
          
                                    RHONDA
                    Sam!
          
          She looks to Murphy, who is on the phone.
          
          Murphy and the others join her at the window. They see
          Rubin on the ground, but the Snow Melter blocks any view
          of the killer.
          
                                                        SMASH CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
          
          The Killer turns to leave the crime scene and --
          
          -- WHACK! He's blindsided by a SHOVEL to his head.
          Goggles shatter.

          CONTINUED:
          
          He drops.
          
          Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps
          the goggle from his face.
          
          It's KELLER!
          
          Blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head.
          
          The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of
          him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine
          blade.
          
          Pryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck
          askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering
          from the impact --
          
                                     KELLER
                       I sh... sh... shoulda killed you
                       at Vostok.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Where are the cannisters?
          
                                       KELLER
                       Go to hell.
          
                                       PRYCE
                       Wrong answer.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Help me drag him over here.
          
          They each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him
          back over to the Snow Melter.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Keep him still.
          
          She hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's
          neck.
          
          Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then
          whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold
          makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       Who's Tahir selling it to --
                       what's the intended target?
          
          Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her
          knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing
          bare arms and legs.

                    What're you doing, you crazy
                    bitch?
          
          Keller instantly starts to shake.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Why did you kill those scientists,
                    Keller? Was a four-way split too
                    much for you?
          
                                    KELLER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter.
          
          She brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him
          with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground
          as it freezes instantly.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Where is the uranium?
          
                                  KELLER
                         (almost smug)
                    You have no idea what's going on
                    here, do you?
          
          Keller begins to shiver violently.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Hit the sonofabitch again!
          
          Carrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm.        He
          screams. Pain is too much. He caves.
          
                                  KELLER
                    The plane, they're in the fucking
                    plane.
          
          Carrie's suddenly grabbed from behind.     It's Murphy.
          Furious. Two other guys at his side.
          
                                  MURPHY
                    Have you completely lost your

                                    CARRIE
                    Let go of me.
          
          She twists free of his grasp.      Gets in Keller's face.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)

                    What the hell's going on?
          
          She glares at him.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    The cannisters are on the plane.
          
          She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Throw him in the holding cell.
          
          The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the
          ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller
          screams.
          
          The guys lift him to his feet.     Haul him away.
          
          Murphy looks to Pryce --

                    Name's Pryce.
          
          Pryce looks at Carrie.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    He's with the UN. We have to
                    search that plane now!
          
          Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare --
          
                                  MURPHY
                    We don't have time. We'll just
                    search it in Christchurch when it
                    lands.
          
          Pryce steps in --
          
                                  PRYCE
                    It's a twelve hour flight to
                    Christchurch. Anything can happen
                    in that time. Keller is here, so
                    we know it's still on the ground.

          Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of
          seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees
          tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo.

                       He's buying time.
          
          Carrie races off the plane.    Pryce tries to keep pace.
          
                                                               87.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which
          is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the
          evac. Pryce is close behind.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Out of the way!
          
          
          INT. ASB - MARSHAL'S OFFICE - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters. Pryce at her side. Her face goes white.
          The door to the holding room is wide open. Keller's
          GONE.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    Shit!
          
                                  PRYCE
                    He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to
                    hide.
          
          Then it hits her --
          
                                    CARRIE
                    He won't try.    He's a goddamn
                    pilot.
          
          As the two of them take off for the door --
          
          
          INT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY
          
          Delfy walks across the floor. Hangar is minimally lit.
          Still. Silent. Void of personnel. The Otters are lined
          up. The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side. He
          heads toward an Otter.
          
          
          INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGAR - DAY
          
          Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is
          still hanging on the console. Then, something catches
          his attention through the windshield of his plane. He
          sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and it's
          pumping.
          
          Curious, he gets out of the Otter. Eyes dart about the
          hangar. Doesn't see anyone. Heads to the other plane.
          Discovers that a door is open on the other side. Takes a
          another look around. Doesn't see anyone. Moves closer.
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Gets to the plane.   Takes a look inside, and --
          
          THUD!   He's nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the
          head.   Stumbles back.
          
          Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy.
          
          Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool
          chest. Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap.
          Unconscious.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - HEADING TOWARD THE HANGAR - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie and Pryce, dressed in ECW are making their way
          toward the hangar.
          
          
          INT. LC-130 - SAME
          
          Employees are trudging up through the back entrance into
          the plane. Get checked off a list by the LOAD MASTER.
          Toss their gear into a netted cargo area. Find a seat.
          Plane is nearly full.
          
          
          INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGER
          
          Keller has the engine going. It's loud. Preps the
          console for flight, flipping switches -- suddenly sees
          Carrie and Pryce enter the hangar. Guns drawn.
          
          
          CARRIE AND PRYCE
          
          Shift their attention to the plane.    Blades turning. They
          stalk forward. Slowly. Carefully.      Eyeing for any
          betrayal of movement.
          
          Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in. Fast.
          Ready. Look into the plane. It's empty, except for a
          duffle bag in the back. Carrie nods to Pryce. Motions
          for him to go one way, she'll go another.
          
          INTERCUT CARRIE AND PRYCE
          Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat. It's door is slightly open.
          She heads for it. Gun poised.
          
          Pryce moves to check the next plane.    Eyes dart to every
          dark corner.
          
          Carrie gets to the Cat.    Springs toward the door.
          Inside's empty.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane. Spots
          Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. Looks
          like he's stirring into consciousness. Then --
          
          SWOOSH!! An ICE AXE swings down from above, embedding in
          his Pryce's chest. Deep. It sticks. Gun goes flying.
          Keller drops down from the wing above. Pryce staggers.
          Keller kicks him hard.
          
          Pryce goes down.   Keller grabs the gun.
          
          Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot --
          
          BANG!BANG! Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover
          behind SOME EQUIPMENT. Another rips into his shoulder.
          
          Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires
          continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots
          go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right
          hand.
          
          Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots
          back, which --
          
          -- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover
          beneath the plane. He's losing blood quick.
          
          Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST.
          They stop. Carrie has to reload.
          
          Keller makes his move. Fires at Carrie and sprints for
          his plane. Runs right by pole with a large red button
          attached to it. Slams it.
          
          HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN
          
          The TEMPERATURE immediately begins to PLUMMET as winter
          is let inside.
          
          Keller keeps shooting.   Runs out of bullets.   Leaps into
          the idling Otter.
          
          Carrie makes her move.   Dashes toward him, firing away.
          
          Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate --
          glass is too thick -- protection from the cold.
          
          Keller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward
          toward the opening doors.
          
          Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet.
          Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual
          once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce.
          He's bleeding profusely.
          
          She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of
          his chest.
          
          Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    ...I didn't see him.
          
          His eyes flutter shut.   Carrie slaps his face --
          
                                    CARRIE
                    No!    You stay awake!
          
          Puts her hand directly on the wound.   Applies pressure.
          Blood continues to ooze.
          
          She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the
          hangar.
          
          Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Damn it!
                         (to Delfy)
                    Come on. We're getting him up.
          
          They lift him to his feet. Haul ass to the front of the
          hangar the best they can. Go outside.
          
          
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the
          ground.
          
          Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the
          bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    Press here.    Hard. Hard or he
                    will die!
          
                                     DELFY
                    It won't stop!
          
          Looks Delfy right in the eye.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    He's not going to be number four!

          Pryce moans.
          
          Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner.
          
          Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it
          around him. Keeps repeating the motion.
          
          She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane
          moving toward the runway.
          
          The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake.
          
                                     PRYCE
                            (GASPING)
                       What are you doing?   Get Keller.
          
          She holds him down.

                       You're bleeding out. Freezing

                       You hold on.
          
          Carrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick
          draw. Keys it.

                                     CARRIE
                       Tell him to stay put, and I need
                       your help getting Pryce there.
                       We're at the hangar. I've got to
                       stop Keller, he's got the
                       cannisters.

          INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          On a full sprint, Carrie dashes over to the Snowmobiles.
          Coughs. Spits blood. Doesn't stop her. She jumps on
          one. Fires it up. Uses her left palm to steer -- blood
          starts to seep through the gauze. She quickly bundles
          up, then guns it.
          
          Rubber treads grip. Smoke rises. She races it across
          the cement floor and out the hangar.
          
          
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of
          the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the
          wind.
          
          Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to ASB.    Hits her
          light as she races in.

          Carrie's light silhouettes Murphy and a couple of his
          guys as they head toward her. She doesn't even slow down
          as she blows right by them.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto
          the runway. His wound oozes blood -- eats the pain as he
          gives it full throttle. Starts to pick up speed. Heads
          down his strip of freedom.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          closing.
          
          He's pushing to get airborne.        Seventy-five yards between
          them.
          
          Gap narrows fast.    Fifty yards.
          
          Stay on Carrie. Looks like suicide. She suddenly
          swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm --
          
          INSIDE WITH KELLER
          
          He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get
          airborne -- until -- LAUNCHING UP OFF THE BERM is
          Carrie's snowmobile! She bails, letting it continue
          right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she
          tumbles down the berm.
          
          Keller's pov - a THOUSAND POUNDS of snowmobile comes at
          him fast -- obliterates the cockpit.
          
                                                             SMASH CUT TO
          
          
          CARRIE'S POV - AS THE IMPACT
          
          Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways. A wing catches
          the runway, CATAPULTING the entire plane into a cartwheel
          of disaster as it veers off the runway and --
          
          -- EXPLODES INTO A FIERY ERUPTION OF FLAME AND DEBRIS!
          
          Resume -
          
          Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting
          off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold
          and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly.
          
          AT THE WRECKAGE

          CONTINUED:
          
          Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on
          the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit.
          The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in.
          
          Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller.
          In the back -- the charred duffle bag. She moves closer.
          
          Reaches in through a broken window.       Pulls it out to the
          runway.
          
          Unzips it.    Is confused.    No cannisters.   Only survival
          gear.

          Delfy, along with Murphy and his two guys, carry Pryce
          in. Doc's in the back room with two others, loading the
          BODYBAGS onto a cart.
          
                                       MURPHY
                       Doc!
          
          Doc quickly moves into the front room.      The other two
          follow. Curious.
          
          Doc springs into action, pulling on gloves.       Pryce's
          face, ashen.

          They usher him onto one. He looks to Delfy who still has
          his hand on Pryce's wound.

                       You, four units O-pos in the

          The guy heads for it.
          
          Carrie enters. She's still in her ECW gear.        Heart sinks
          when she sees Pryce.

          at them like a tidal wave. Brings a walkie to her

                       Can you do this on the plane?
                       It's your call, but I need to know
                       now.
          
          Doc, who's wrestling with deep contemplation, looks to
          Carrie -- she sees the answer's no.

          The wind   is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men
          are just   about to board the plane. Murphy looks to the
          storm --   a forboding darkness getting closer by the
          second.    He realizes they might not make it.

          The LC-130's jet engines roars as he gains speed down the
          runway -- faster and faster, then it suddenly gets
          swallowed in the storm -- like an avalanche covering a
          skier.
          
          Camera stays on the fast moving storm, the plane, nowhere
          in sight, until --
          
          The LC-130 finally pushes out the front of it --
          AIRBORNE. Takes off into the horizon, where we see that
          the sun is just about to set.

          Carrie is standing next to Pryce on the examination
          table. He's been bandaged up. Eyes closed. Looks
          thrashed. An IV drip hangs from a stand on wheels.
          
          She's looking at him with soft, caring eyes -- been
          through a lot. He slowly opens his. Tries to smile, not
          easy.
          
                                   PRYCE

                    You get him?

                                   CARRIE
                    Nope.
          
          They both think on it for a moment.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    What did we miss? Think Keller
                    cut and run without the stuff?
          
                                  CARRIE
                    After all this, no way. Keller
                    didn't have it on the plane
                    because he's got it hidden
                    somewhere.
                     (BEAT)
                    Where would he hide something for
                    six months. Somewhere he could be
                    sure no one would ever look.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    If he had made it out, he wouldn't
                    have been crazy enough to come
                    back for it.

          She sees it's Weiss' name on the tag, but something
          disturbing catches Carrie's eye -- it's Weiss' LEFT LEG

          STITCHES running down the side.

          Carrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where
          she chased Rubin.
          
          Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining
          daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run
          along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black.
          WINTER HAS SET IN.
          
          She HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers
          through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her.
          
          Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay
          tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the
          door.
          
          She rises to her feet. Hurries down to the end.
          Disappears into the science building.
          
          
          INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab
          stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room.
          Heads for the freezer.
          
          
          INT. WALK-IN FREEZER - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie opens the door.    Illuminates the interior with her
          light.

          CONTINUED:
          Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three
          walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney,
          Rubin, Weiss and Keller.
          
          Carry goes to Weiss' body. Kneels next to him. Goes to
          unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a
          plastic cinch.
          
          Pulls out her knife. Holds the light steady in her mouth
          as she cuts the cinch. Unzips the bag.
          
          Her light travels down his body to his left leg. She
          rolls it slightly for a better look. The truth hits her
          like a sledge hammer. There it is, like standing center
          stage in her light, the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep
          gash tight together.
          
          She's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself.
          Thinks about that leg, those stitches. The fact that Doc
          lied to her. Pans her light over at the other bodies on
          the floor. Her light pans back, explores the rest of
          Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's
          run out from under his armpit.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       (to herself)
                       Someplace no one would ever think
                       to look.
          
          She raises Weiss' arm.    More stitches.
          
          She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM
          OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She
          reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the
          bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE
          CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like
          THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO.
          
          She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her
          hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily.
          Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's
          frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT
          LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until
          she shines her light on it --
          
          The freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core
          sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the
          other two bodies.
          
          She opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more
          cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin. Same
          thing.
          
          Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much.

                    killed him at Delta One One.

          ICE AXE in the ready room, that someone's removed from
          being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted LAB CART
          Pryce used to bust open the door.

          shift inside him -- something illogical.

                    I'll cut you in, Carrie. There's
                    at least 5 million in diamonds in
                    there. That can buy both of us a
                    nice life back in the world. How
                    many times have we both talked
                    about having a fresh start. Well,
                    this is it. Those beakers finding
                    that plane was a sign. A sign
                    telling me it was time to go back.
                    Now I have something to go back
                    for.

          Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who

          Winter-over have been marked off -- long way to go.
          
          
          EXT. ASB BASE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
          
          Pull away from the building, which fades into the icy
          darkness and howling wind of the Antarctic winter.
          
          
          
          THE END
WILD THINGS: DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH

          INT. MUSEUM - DAY
          
          A perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS,
          glinting in the morning sun.
          
          Tounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass
          covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble MUSEUM HALL.
          
          The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the
          breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them. MARIE
          CLIFFORD's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the
          cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds...
          
          She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. Not to touch
          the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted
          in the case below the priceless jewels. It's of a MOTHER cradling
          her BABY DAUGHTER...
          
                              MARIE
                    Today's the day, Mom...
          
                              CURATOR (O.S.)
                    You here again, Marie?
          
          Marie spins round, sees the bespectacled CURATOR, 60's, standing
          behind her.
          
                              MARIE
                    Just leaving.
          
          Marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case...
          
          'THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DIAMONDS...'
          
          EXT. MUSEUM - DAY
          
          Marie fires up her powerful BMW, parked right outside the austere
          Museum building. The powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds
          fluttering skywards...
          
          CREDITS appear over...
          
          ARIEL FOOTAGE of a narrow highway, Marie's BMW streaking through
          the endless tract of Florida wetlands. In the water, GATORS, warm
          themselves in the early morning sun...
          
           MOVING over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical BIRDS
          stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant
          waters in their deafening AIRBOATS...
          
           Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing
          and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip
          three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club.
          
                                                             03/22/2004   2.
          
          
          
          Marie steers her BMW into the showroom-like parking lot of Blue
          Bay High School.
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - MORNING
          
          Marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot, when...
          
          SCCCREEEECCCHHHH!
          
          She SLAMS on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car.
          Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing
          arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt.
          
          She sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her
          windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from
          the front bumper of the BMW.
          
          The sudden jolt has changed the radio station. A newscaster
          rambles on...
          
                              RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                    ... operation, aimed at finally capturing
                    the Black Widow suspect after a six month
                    trail of embezzlement and fraud, once
                    again failed to snare its subject.
          
          ELENA SANDOVAL, 17, stands defiantly in front of the BMW, her
          don't-fuck-with-me stare in direct contrast with her come-fuck-me
          clothes.
          
                                 RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                    Blue Bay Police Detective Michael
                    Morrison was able to recover over
                    $400,000 in stolen money, but the
                    suspect, described as Female, between
                    eighteen and thirty, remains at large...
          
          Marie reaches out with a trembling hand, turns off the stereo,
          then leans out of the car window.
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm... so... sorry...
          
          Elena smiles wryly.
          
                              ELENA
                    You will be.
          
          And she means it...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   3.
          
          
          
          INT. BLUE BAY HIGH AUDITORIUM - MORNING
          
          The auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body. The
          natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat
          headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back.
          
          Marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still
          shocked by what happened out in the parking lot...
          
                              JENNY
                        (handing over a present)
                    Happy birthday, babe. They ain't
                    diamonds, but you're just gonna have to
                    wait for those...
          
          Marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of OPAL EARRINGS.
          
                              MARIE
                        (unconvincing)
                    Thank you. Thank you so much...
          
                              JENNY
                    Are you OK, hon?
          
          Marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the
          freaks and geeks crowd round Elena, worshipping her like the
          Goddess she is...
          
                              MARIE
                    I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's
                    just...that new girl...I almost hit her
                    in the parking lot...
          
                              JENNY
                    You mean the towel girl, the one who
                    transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You
                    know the only reason she's slinging
                    towels is 'cos it's court ordered...
          
          Marie and Elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea
          of hormonally challenged students as Principal LIONEL MOSSTER, his
          ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained, steps onstage.
          
                              MOSSTER
                    We're here today to address a growing
                    epidemic that affects all of you.
          
          He pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down...
          
                              MOSSTER
                    National studies report sexual activity
                    among students at an all-time high.
          
                                                          03/22/2004   4.
          
          
          
          The students all cheer, naturally.
          
                              MOSSTER
                    We'll see who's cheering when you've got
                    an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or
                    get slapped with a paternity suit...Or
                    arrested for date rape. But don't take my
                    word for it...
          
          He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural
          beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and
          glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome...
          
                              PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
                    Miss Richards and Dr. Borman are here to
                    tell you about the pitfalls first hand...
          
          Kristen steps up to the lectern.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Good morning, my name is Kristen
                    Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami
                    juvenile parole board, as some of you
                    already know...
          
          Quick glance at Elena who rolls her eyes...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    But that's not what brings me here today.
                    When I heard about Principal Mosster's
                    sex education program I thought I'd
                    volunteer my own personal story, in hopes
                    that you might learn from the mistakes I
                    made. Back in High school all I wanted to
                    do was get drunk, stoned and laid...
          
          The students roar their approval.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    By my junior year, my life was a blur of
                    cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every
                    night of the week...
          
          Elena covers her mouth, as if to cough...
          
                              ELENA
                        (through fake coughs)
                    ...whore...
          
          Kristen ignores the slur.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   5.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And then, one night at some pathetic frat
                    party, someone slipped a roofie in my
                    drink...and raped me.
          
          This quiets the auditorium.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't
                    crawl when I think of the violation and
                    humiliation I endured. I can promise you
                    that if you make the same kind of wrong-
                    headed choices I did, you'll be seeing
                    Dr. Borman...
          
          Chad steps to the podium.
          
                              CHAD
                    Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr.
                    Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at
                    the police department, where my work has
                    helped convict hundreds of sex offenders.
                    Most teens like Ms. Richards never get
                    their lives together. The physical scars
                    may go away, but the emotional damage
                    stays forever.
          
          While Chad drones on, MUDDY, a Gremlin-eyed drooler, sitting in
          front of Elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up
          on the back of the chair. He spots the ugly plastic bracelet
          locked around one of her ankles.
          
                              MUDDY
                    That's not...what I think it is, is it?
          
                              ELENA
                    Whattchya think it is, bitch?
          
          The words catch in his throat.
          
                              MUDDY
                    One of them...Parole leashes...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bingo.
          
                              MUDDY
                    So you can't, like, go more than ten
                    miles from the cop shop?
          
          Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.
          
                                                             03/22/2004   6.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Five. I got someone's panties in a bunch.
          
          Back at the podium, Chad leans forward, making sure his words
          resonate with the student body.
          
                              CHAD
                    And as for the perpetrators of this
                    heinous act, even if you are still a
                    minor, you will be tried as an adult,
                    and, if convicted, you will do hard time.
          
          He pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students.
          
                              CHAD
                    Are there any questions?
          
                              ELENA
                        (calling out)
                    Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards.
          
                                KRISTEN
                    Ask away.
          
                              ELENA
                    When they found the scumbag who took your
                    precious flower of virginity, you sued
                    his sorry ass, right?
          
          Kristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her
          words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Uh, no, actually, I was never able to
                    make a positive ID. All I remember was
                    his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in
                    my ear, "You won't remember, but you'll
                    never forget..."
          
          Elena cracks a sideways grin...
          
                              ELENA
                    So what you're really saying is you
                    fucked for free...
          
          Kristen has no answer to that. Principal Mosster does his best to
          control the situation...
          
                              PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
                    Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young
                    lady!
          
          Like Elena cares.   She leans back, nods. Job done.
          
                                                                        7.
          
          
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH DIVING POOL - DAY
          
          The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the
          side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full
          swing...
          
                              ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Blue Bay High School would like to
                    welcome all participating diving teams
                    from the tri-county region...
          
          Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their
          school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area.
          
          But all eyes are on the home team. Masturbatory fantasies abound
          as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches...
          
          And as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to
          absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white
          bathing suit.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    First up, district champion Marie
                    Clifford...
          
          The crowd cheers, watching Marie edge out to the diving platform
          twenty feet above. Jenny right behind, waits on the ladder...
          
          JAY CLIFFORD, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late
          thirties, focuses a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA on Marie from the front
          row of the bleachers...
          
                              JAY
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          Marie just rolls her eyes.
          
                              JENNY
                    Your stepfather's just got a lot invested
                    in the team.
          
          Marie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices
          the incongruous figure of Elena, sidling up to him...
          
                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    Just try to keep those legs together.
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen
                    Virgin.
          
          
          
                                                           03/22/2004   8.
          
          
          
          Jay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with
          the world's hottest towel girl...
          
                                 JAY
                    Excuse me?
          
                              ELENA
                    You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in
                    Clifford construction?
          
                              JAY
                    I am, yes, but...
          
                              ELENA
                    I'd love to see one of your erections...
          
          Whoa. Jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the
          platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into
          the air.
          
          It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double
          back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form. She quickly
          resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with
          her teammates before crossing to Jay.
          
                               JAY
                    Nice take off, gotta work on the
                    landing...
          
                              MARIE
                    I can't do any better...
          
          Jay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately.
          
                              JAY
                    No such word as 'can't. Now do it again.
                    Only better...
          
          Marie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. As
          she's about to start the arduous climb, Elena hands her a towel...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bet you choke.
          
          Stops Marie in her tracks.
          
                              MARIE
                    What's your major malfunction?
          
                              ELENA
                    Just wanted to make a wager. Between best
                    friends.
          
                                                                        9.
          
          
          
          Marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform.
          
                              ELENA
                    You blow this dive, I get those diamonds
                    of yours.
          
          Marie stops, looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the
          ladder, shakes her head...
          
                              MARIE
                    How'd you know about my inheritance?
          
                              ELENA
                    Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's
                    the day, right?
          
                              MARIE
                    And what, pray tell, are you willing to
                    wager when I win?
          
          Elena thinks for a second, glances back at Jay with a big smile.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll stay away from your stepfather. You
                    make it, I won't be your new stepmom
                    anytime soon. Whattya say?
          
          Marie just stands there incredulous for a moment.
          
                              MARIE
                    Take your sorry ass back to the swamps.
          
          She ascends the ladder, leaving Elena behind...
          
                              ELENA
                    Choke!
          
          Marie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on
          the task at hand. But can't help but notice her nemesis below,
          walking slowly, seductively, up to Jay, intoxicating him...
          
          Marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at
          hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop
          looming beyond...
          
          She slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. It's an odd
          design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond...
          
          She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting
          in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split
          second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   10.
          
          
          
          She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking
          beauty. Thank God this is in slow motion.
          
          And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks,
          does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible
          instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.
          
          Marie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE. Treading water, she can't help
          but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers...
          
          EXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON
          
          Sickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the
          inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion...
          
          Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the
          grounds. Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non-
          alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch
          of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland...
          
          Marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs
          and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.
                               J
                               ENNY
                    What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that
                    one judge only gave you a 9.7?
          
          Marie forces a smile.
          
                              MARIE
                    Nah. I'm cool.
          
                              JENNY
                    Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe.
                    You got diamonds on the mind.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    Have either of you seen my video camera?
          
          Marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a
          bemused look to Jay's face.
          
                              JAY
                    I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure...
          
          He shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against
          it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers...
          
                              JAY
                    Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass
                    to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday.
          
          Everyone raises their fine crystal.
          
          H
          
          
          
          
                                                           03/22/2004   11.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    She's become every inch of the woman her
                    Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is
                    now, Julie's looking down and smiling.
          
          Tears well in Marie's eyes...
          
                              JAY
                    And that's why, on your eighteenth
                    birthday, Marie, I know your mother
                    wanted you to have...
          
          He notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well-dressed MEN
          standing at the entrance to his house. Whoever they are, Jay's
          instantly unnerved. He stumbles over his words...
          
                              JAY
                    ... she wanted you to have... a wonderful
                    birthday party surrounded by all your
                    friends.
          
           e glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter...
          
                              JAY
                    Please excuse me.
          
          ... and hurries after them.   Marie is left dumbfounded. So close,
          but so far...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay! What about my present?
          
          She chases after him...
          
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the
          opulent Clifford Mansion, past framed family photos, of Jay, Marie
          and the late Julie...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay?
          H
           e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in
          the kitchen. She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne, pops the
          cork. Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    It simply can't be done...
          
          Marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway,
          and down towards Jay's study...
          
                                                                       12.
          
          
          
                              JAY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    In all construction there's delays.
          
          Marie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack. What she
          sees makes the blood run cold in her veins...
          
          An imposing Cuban businessman, MR. BARAJAS, stands threateningly
          over a visibly frightened Jay. Another man, CICATRIZ, dressed in
          designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn
          of this little operation.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    Four months is not a delay. It's a
                    disaster.
          
                              JAY
                    You have my word, Mr. Barajas, the
                    building is almost finished. Just give me
                    a week, two tops.
          
          Barajas nods to Cicatriz, who moves in on Jay with lightning
          quickness, holds a Razor sharp KNIFE against his thumb.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    We are long past the negotiation stage.
          
          Cicatriz runs the steel blade across Jay's thumb. Marie has to
          cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood
          stain the spotless white carpet.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS (CONT'D)
                    For every day the building goes
                    unfinished, we'll take a finger...
          
          A sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips.
          
                              CICATRIZ
                    Pray, Mr. Clifford, you finish before the
                    eleventh day...
          
          And with that the Cuban men head to the door. Marie scrambles
          away, her heart pounding...
          
          She's halfway down the hallway when Mr. Barajas and Cicatriz exit
          Jay's study. She turns, tries to look innocent as the Cuban
          'businessmen' stare her down.
          J
           ay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow.
          
                              JAY
                    Marie! Shouldn't you be with your
                    friends?
          
          A
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   13.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    I was just...
          
          Cicatriz takes a step towards her.
          
                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    I'll be right there. With your gift...
                    just... wait outside, OK?
          
          Marie backs away, never taking her eyes off the intimidating Cuban
          men...
          
          EXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi-clad partygoers, in a
          daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne.
          
          Jenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost
          sheep with open arms.
          
                              JENNY
                    So? Did you get the key? Are you Blue
                    Bay's richest bitch?
          
          Marie's thoughts are drowned out by the ROAR of a powerful engine.
          All attention turns to a rusted MOTORCYCLE as it streaks across
          the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of MUD in its wake.
          
           nd atop the bike... Elena, in skintight leathers.
          
                              JENNY
                    Holy shit, who invited her?
          
          Marie's slightly drunken eyes narrow. Elena brings the bike to a
          screeching halt inches from the surprised guests. The ultimate
          partycrasher...
          
                              MARIE
                    This is a private party...
          
                              ELENA
                    Don't mind me. I ain't here for your
                    stupid party.
          
          She's striding towards the Mansion, towards Jay who's standing at
          the patio doors, an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands.
          
                              MARIE
                    Get the hell outta here! NOW!
          
          Marie stumbles after Elena, grabbing her from behind, holding her
          back. There's a tense moment before...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   14.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Damn girl, whattcha been drinking?
          
                              MARIE
                    Stay away from my stepfather!
          
                                 ELENA
                    Make me...
          
          And that's it. Marie lashes out with a haymaker punch. Connects on
          Elena's jaw and she goes reeling back. But it's ignited the street
          fighter in her, and she comes roaring back into the fray, ramming
          into Marie and together they tumble to the ground...
          T
           he crowds gather to watch the cat-fight, in equal parts appalled
          and aroused. It's a hair pulling, teeth gnashing, make up smearing
          wrestling match, no holds barred. The drunken Marie has the upper
          hand, the alcohol fueling her rage.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    What the hell's going on here?
          
          And that stops the fight right there and then. Marie looks up to
          see a red faced Jay standing over her.
          
                              MARIE
                    This...trash is just looking for a meal
                    ticket...
          
          Elena gets to her feet, licks the blood from her split lip.
          
                              ELENA
                    Mr. Clifford. Betcha proud of little
                    Marie now, huh?
          
          He hauls Marie to her feet, thrusts her towards the mansion.
          
                              JAY
                    Party's over.
          
          Groans from the crowd, but Jay's mind is made up.
          
                              MARIE
                    But...what about...my present...
          
          Jay's already walking away.
          
                              JAY
                    I'm going to the condos. Sleep it off,
                    whydontcha?
          
          Elena watches Jay stride away, like a lioness stalking her prey...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   15.
          
          
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING SITE - NIGHT
          
          Work lights illuminate the half finished condo building site, on
          prime beachfront real estate. These places would sell for
          millions, if they were ever finished...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          In a concrete makeshift office, on the top floor of the condo
          building, Jay clicks open the lock on his large metal safe and the
          steel door swings open.
          
          Inside are stacks of CASH, piled high, along with a shiny new
          HANDGUN. Jay flicks through the money, shaking his head...
          
                              JAY
                        (sotto)
                    Not enough. Just not enough...
          
          A clanking noise from outside has him quickly snatching the gun
          from the safe, before closing it once more, spinning the lock...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
          
          Jay walks out of his office, into the half-finished top floor of
          the condos. Exposed beams and drying cement reveal how far behind
          schedule Jay really is...
                               J
                               AY
                    Hello? Anyone there?
          
          He swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the
          flickering florescent light...
          
          Finally Jay lowers the weapon. It looks like he might collapse,
          until he catches himself, palms flat against the wall, head down.
          
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                    Fuck me...
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    Any time. Any place...
          
          He reels around, sees Elena moving toward him, brushing aside the
          thick plastic sheeting. She has a bottle of beer in one hand, a
          video camera in the other. Jay's video camera to be precise...
          
                              JAY
                    What are you doing here?
          
                              ELENA
                    You promised to show me your erection...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   16.
          
          
          
          Elena focuses the video camera on Jay's crotch. Makes him
          incredibly uncomfortable, obviously.
          
                              JAY
                    Is that my...camera?
          
          Elena thrusts the bottle of beer at Jay.
          
                              ELENA
                    Lighten up, Jay.
          
          Jay takes the bottle from her, sets it down on the concrete floor.
          
                              JAY
                    Enough's enough. I think it's time you
                    left.
          
          This brings a teasing pout to Elena's lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    Is that any way to treat Marie's new best
                    friend?
          
          Jay's taken aback.
          
                              JAY
                    You're best friends are you?
          
                              ELENA
                    Sure. We've been having sleepovers.
                    Talking about boys, swapping tips. She's
                    been teaching me about shopping, I've
                    been teaching her about giving mind
                    blowing head...
          
          Jay's taken aback once more. How much more aback can he be taken?
          He reaches out and blocks the video camera lens.
          
                              JAY
                    Gimme the camera back...
          
          Elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him. Keeps the
          camera trained on his worried face...
          
                              ELENA
                    Come get it.
          
          Jay's reaching his elastic limit. He reaches for the camera, but
          Elena won't let go. They wrestle for control of the video camera.
          And finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across
          the room and SHATTERS on the concrete floor...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   17.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                        (slyly)
                    Ooopppps.
          
          Elena runs her finger under Jay's chin, then turns and walks away,
          leaving Jay standing there, all taken aback.
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING    - NIGHT
          
          A drunken Marie brings her BMW to a swerving halt outside the
          construction site. She takes a swig from the Champagne bottle on
          the passenger seat for dutch courage...
          
                              MARIE
                        (sotto)
                    It's present time.
          
          She reaches for the car door handle, but comes up short. When she
          looks back up she's in for some taking aback of her own...
          
          Elena comes walking out of the building site, and the two girls
          lock eyes. There's an uncomfortable moment before Elena flashes a
          satisfied smile and walks away...
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell...
          
          Marie's about to get out of her car when Jay comes walking out of
          the site, looks around the lot, sees Marie's car.
          
                              JAY
                    What are you doing here at this time of
                    night?
          
          Marie stammers to find the words...
          
                              MARIE
                    I just...wanted to apologize for my
                    behavior earlier. I was out of line.
          
          Jay's mood lightens.
          
                              JAY
                    When we admit our mistakes we grow.
                    You've made an important step.
          
                              MARIE
                    So...what about my present?
          
                              JAY
                    Meet me at the Museum. Before school
                    tomorrow. Now go home, get some sleep,
                    I'm gonna finish up here...
          
                                                          03/22/2004    18.
          
          
          
          He walks away and a smile creeps across Marie's face.
          
                                                      FADE TO BLACK:
          
          INT. MUSEUM - MORNING
          
          A perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother
          Daughter DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun.
          
          Marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically
          in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand
          towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels...
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    You really think you're ready for your
                    inheritance?
          
          Marie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum, still in
          the same clothes as yesterday...
          
                              MARIE
                    It was...it was what Mom wanted...
          
          Jay looks at her sternly.
          
                              JAY
                    You're the only one who can open that
                    lock, but I'm the one with the key. She
                    wanted you to have the diamonds when you
                    were responsible enough to know what to
                    do with them...
                              M
                              MARIE
                    I'm...responsible...
          
          Jay shakes his head slowly, deliberately.
          
                              JAY
                    Really? Underage drinking, prying into my
                    personal affairs, fighting...
          
                              MARIE
                    But they're mine. Mom left them to me.
          
                              JAY
                    They're yours when I say they're yours.
                    For the time being, I've got some major
                    problems at the construction site.
                    Deadlines have to be met. We'll talk
                    again when you've done some growing up.
          
          Jay puts an arm around his stepdaughter, starts walking her back
          towards the massive wooden doors.
          
                              M
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004    19.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    Please, don't fight me on this.   We're
                    Team Clifford, remember?
          
                              MARIE
                        (without conviction)
                    Team Clifford...
          
          She's stuck in an awkward embrace with her Step Father...
          
          EXT. MUSEUM - MORNING
          
          Jay leads Marie down the stone steps outside the quaint Museum
          building. But as they approach his car they're hit by...BLUE and
          RED FLASHING LIGHTS.
          
          The whine of sirens has Jay spinning around in surprise, looking
          over to see four Police Cruisers come to a screeching halt...
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell?
          
          Half a dozen of Blue Bay's finest, lead by the dashing young
          OFFICER ENTWISTLE, draw their badges, approach Jay.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    Mr. Clifford?
          
                              JAY
                    Can I help you, Officer?
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    You're under arrest on suspicion of rape.
          
          Jay's jaw drops to the ground.
          
                              JAY
                    There must be some mistake, this isn't
                    possible...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay, what's going on?
          
          Entwistle puts a powerful hand on Jay, leads him to the first
          Police cruiser.      J
                               AY
                    Call my lawyer, tell him to meet me down
                    the station. This is outrageous...
          
          Entwistle gets into the Police car's passenger seat.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   20.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    I didn't do anything, I swear.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    I'm afraid she's got a different story.
          
                              JAY
                    Who's 'she'?
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
          
          Elena paces the sterile interview room like a caged tiger. She
          stops in front of the two way mirror, examines her reflection...
          
          Tentatively she reaches out a trembling finger touching the scab
          on her lip, covering the wound Marie inflicted at the party. And
          slowly Elena starts to press on the cut, until the blood starts to
          flow once more...
          
          There's a quiet knock on the door and Elena quickly lowers her
          hand, looks round...
          
          Kristen Richards, the young Parole Officer who so heart
          wrenchingly told her story at Blue Bay High earlier, comes quietly
          into the gray room.
          
                               KRISTEN
                    Elena.
          
          Elena just looks up at her pitifully.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Could you tell me what happened?
          
          Through stifled sobs, Elena states...
          
                              ELENA
                    It was Jay Clifford. He raped me...
          
          The interview room door swings open and DETECTIVE MICHAEL
          MORRISON, 30's, enters. He's the personification of the term
          "overworked, underpaid."
          
                              MORRISON
                    You understand the seriousness of this
                    allegation, young lady?
          
          Elena nods weakly.
          
                              MORRISON
                    And you know that we'll leave no stone un-
                    turned in the investigation.
          
                                                                       21.
                              MORRISON(CONT'D)
                    There'll be a battery of forensics tests
                    you'll have to take, humiliating stuff.
                    And background checks, digging up all
                    kinds of dirt. And you'll have to testify
                    in court, face the man you're accusing...
          
          Crocodile tears roll down Elena's cheeks.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You sure you want to go through with
                    this? No harm, no foul, you can just walk
                    away right now....
          
          Kristen interjects...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Please, Detective, this isn't the right
                    time...
          
                              ELENA
                    I ain't lying. You think I'm lying?
          
          Kristen turns to her young ward...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    If you're telling the truth, you won't
                    find a more sympathetic ear...
          
                              ELENA
                    'If' I'm telling the truth...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And if you're not, there's gonna be
                    trouble, you understand?
          
                              MORRISON
                    This is already trouble. The man you're
                    accusing happens to be a friend of mine,
                    and when the DNA tests prove you're lying
                    I'm gonna come down on you like a ton of
                    bricks, mark my words...
          
          Elena withers under his glare...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
          
          Jay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and THEO
          BLOOM, his sharp suited attorney.
          
                              THEO
                    We're gonna sue their asses til time runs
                    backwards...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   22.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    You've gotta believe me, I would never,
                    could never do anything like this, you
                    know that don't you?
          
          Marie takes his hand, squeezes it.
          
                              MARIE
                    We're team Clifford.
          
          Jay forces a tired smile...
          
                              JAY
                    That's my girl.
          
          The door swings open and Morrison enters...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Jay. Marie. Mr. Bloom...
          
          Jay stands, shakes Morrison's hand.
          
                              MORRISON
                        (to Marie)
                    Would you mind waiting outside while me
                    and your stepdad have a little chat...
          
          Marie looks to Jay, doesn't want to leave.
          
                              JAY
                    It's OK honey. Michael and I are old
                    pals...
          
          Reluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her.
          Jay sits back down. Morrison takes a chair opposite.
          
                              JAY
                    How's the divorce treating you?
          
                              MORRISON
                    She's taken me for everything I'm worth.
                    I swear to God, I'm never trusting
                    another woman as long as I live.

           heo intervenes...
          
                              THEO
                    This is most egregious, Detective, my
                    client has pressing matters at his
                    construction site. He can't afford to
                    waste time with this frivolous
                    nonsense...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   23.

                        (to Jay)
                    Look, we're taking her statement right
                    now, gonna run every forensic test in the
                    book. Guarantee the case'll come apart
                    like a $2 watch...
          
          Jay nods, certain he can beat this rap...
          
                              JAY
                    She had my camcorder. Recorded what
                    happened. It should still be at the
                    construction site. It'll clear my name...
          
          Morrison nods.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You'll be outta here by tonight.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Marie waits out in the anonymous hallway, talking a mile-a-minute
          on her cell phone...
          
                              MARIE (ON PHONE)
                    I can't believe it, Jenny...It just
                    doesn't make sense...I mean, I know
                    Jay...I know he'd never...
          
          When a door down the hall opens she looks up expectantly, only to
          see Kristen come out, walk towards her, followed by someone.
          Marie's view is blocked by Kristen until the Parole Officer passes
          her and reveals...Elena.
          
                              MARIE
                    This can't be...
          
          A look somewhere between horror and shock is etched on Marie's
          beautiful face. Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss.
          
                              ELENA
                    No such word as 'can't'...
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - DAY
          
          Police cars line the driveway outside the beach front building
          site. Officers cordon off the road as Forensics teams photograph
          every inch of the building...
          
          Standing amidst the crowd of onlookers is an irate Mr. Barajas,
          accompanied, as ever, by Cicatriz. They are both on CELLPHONES,
          both talking angry, fast Spanish.
          
                                                               03/22/2004   24.
          
          
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Plastic sheeting covers the windowless top floor of the unfinished
          condos. The white suited FORENSICS TEAM work meticulously, led by
          the tireless Dr. Chad Borman, delicately dusting anything and
          everything that might yield evidence...
          
          Morrison stands at the edge of an area cordoned off by POLICE
          TAPE. He's looking at Jay's smashed DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA, now
          bagged and tagged as evidence...
          
                              KRISTEN (O.S.)
                    Sexual predators often keep a trophy...
          
          Morrison spins, sees Kristen. He stumbles with his words, not used
          to talking to beautiful women...
          
                                 MORRISON
                    I'm sorry?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Maybe he recorded the rape.
          
          Morrison looks at the remains of the camera.
          
                              MORRISON
                    And maybe he didn't. We'll never know.
                    Tape's mangled. Forensics said it'd take
                    months to fix it.
          
          He looks up into Kristen's hypnotic eyes.
          
                              MORRISON
                    We were never properly introduced.
                    Michael Morrison.
          
          She offers her hand, and Morrison shakes it.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Miss Richards. Kristen. Miami Parole. Was
                    just in town for a couple days checking
                    in on some parolees when all this went
                    down...
          
          She hands Morrison a BUSINESS CARD, which he absently stuffs into
          his pocket...
          
                              MORRISON
                    You think maybe you could lean on the
                    girl? Get her to drop this nonsense? We
                    all know she's lying. With all this Black
                    widow shit going down, we just don't have
                    the time or manpower to...

                              KRISTEN
                    She might not be lying, you know.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What makes you think that?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Just a look in her eye. I...I have some
                    experience...
          
          Morrison doesn't want to push her further...
          
          All of a sudden the sunlight is blocked from the massive
          unfinished floor by black sheets erected by the Forensics team,
          leaving everyone in pitch darkness....
          
                              MORRISON
                    What the hell?
          
          Slowly an eerie ULTRA VIOLET GLOW fills the room. The white suited
          forensics technicians, glowing under the black light, wait
          patiently for evidence to show itself...
          
          Suddenly the clear IMPRINTS of hands on the wall become clear,
          along with the black stains of BLOOD FLECKS...
          
                                CHAD
                    Gotcha...
          
                              MORRISON
                    What is it?
          
                              CHAD
                    Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle.
                    I'd say we've got a rape on our hands,
                    Detective, but we won't know for sure
                    until we run the tests...
          
          Morrison's head is spinning...

                    Fine. Just do it...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT
          
          Elena sits on the edge of a gurney in the high tech forensics lab,
          rubbing her arm where a band-aid covers a fresh needle mark. Chad
          appears at the doorway and she stares daggers at him.
          
                              ELENA
                    You vampires really need five pints of my
                    blood? That's like an armful...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   26.
          
          
          
          Chad's surprised by her venom.
          
                              CHAD
                    It's standard procedure in a rape test.
                    Test for drugs and such...
          
                                 ELENA
                    And such.
          
          She continues to pace as Chad makes his way into the room, rounds
          the desk and takes down a plastic beaker from the metal shelf.
          
                              CHAD
                    We're going to need a urine sample. Do
                    you think you could fill this?
          
                                 ELENA
                    From here?
          
          Chad goes red. Puts the plastic cup down on the desk and Elena
          grabs it.            C
                               HAD
                    If...you wouldn't mind...removing your
                    clothes. I'll leave the room, give you
                    some priv...
          
          The breath catches in Chad's throat as Elena takes her shirt off
          without hesitation. Stands there in just her black bra.
          
                              ELENA
                    Done. Next?
          
          Chad's jaw drops. Not just because Elena's in her underwear, but
          because of the clear BITE MARKS on her neck and arms...
          
                              CHAD
                    Those are...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bite marks. He chowed down.
          
                              CHAD
                    They're clear evidence markers...
          
          He reaches out, grabs a Polaroid Camera from the desk, starts
          snapping away like an ornithologist at a bird convention. The
          FLASH of the camera fills the room...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   27.
          
          
          
          EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
          
          FLASHBULBS explode as Marie accompanies her stepfather up the
          steps of the austere Blue Bay courthouse, surrounded by a gaggle
          of sound bite hungry pressmen...
          
                              REPORTER 1
                    Any comment, Mr. Clifford?
          
          Jay puts his hand up to block the intrusive lenses. He disappears
          quickly into the shelter of the courthouse.
          
                              REPORTER 2
                        (to Marie)
                    Did your stepfather rape that girl? How
                    could he do something like that?                           
          Marie stops in her tracks, wheels around and addresses the throng
          of reporters...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay...is innocent...
          
          Says it like she means it...
          
          INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
          
          The packed courthouse is abuzz and the elderly JUDGE WILCOX is
          forced to slam his gavel down...
          
                              JUDGE WILCOX
                    Order!
          
          Jay sits at the defendant's table, suit impeccable, hair
          immaculate, game face on. Theo sits beside him, scribbling notes.
          Marie is in the front row of the gallery, surrounded by her
          coiffured peers. She tries to smile stoically at Jay...
          
          Kristen sits beside Elena at the prosecution table.
          C
           had is on the stand as ARLO MEESE, 35, the slick District
          Attorney, steps forward.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Dr. Borman, do your tests show that Elena                  
                    Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the                     
                    night of the 25th?                                         
                              CHAD                                             
                    Yes they do.                                               
                              D.A. MEESE                                       
                    Do they show that it was forced?                           
          
                                                         03/22/2004   28.
          
          
          
                              CHAD
                                                                               
                    Yes. There was extensive bruising and
                    tearing. We found no semen evidence. The
                    latex abrasions point to the use of
                    protection. This is quite common in cases
                    of premeditated rape.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    And what can you tell us about Miss
                    Sandoval's toxicology reports, Doctor?
          
                              CHAD
                    Came back positive for Rohypnol, a common
                    date rape drug. Traces were also found on
                    the bottle of beer at the crime scene.
                    Both Mr. Clifford and Miss Sandoval's
                    fingerprints were all over the bottle.
          
                              JAY
                    I took it from her. She was far too young
                    to be drinking!
          
          A slam of the gavel silences Jay.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Dr. Borman I am going to show you what's                   
                    been marked as state's exhibit number 1.                   
          He nods to the bailiff and a PROJECTOR whirs to life. An EVIDENCE
          PHOTO that Chad took of Elena's wounds is displayed on a screen
          beside him.
          
                              D.A. MEESE                                       
                    What does this slide show?                                 
                              CHAD
                    Miss Sandoval was found to have numerous
                    bite marks on her upper torso that
                    occurred during the rape.
          
                              JUDGE WILCOX
                    What about those other markings?
          
          Chad looks confused, studies the slide, sees four equidistant dots
          aligned in a small circle.
          
                              CHAD
                    I wasn't able to determine...Fingernail
                    markings, possibly...

          Marie can barely breathe...
          
                              D.A. MEESE                                       
                    I'm going to show you another slide                        
                                                                               
                    that's been marked as state's exhibit
                    number 2.                                                  
          
                                                                               
          Meese nods to the bailiff, who dutifully changes the slide. The
          court goes dark for a second before the next slide is                
          displayed...It's a close up of Jay's teeth mouldings compared to     
                                                                               
          the bite marks...
          
                               D.A. MEESE                                      
                                                                               
                    What can you tell us about these
                    mouldings?                                                 
                              CHAD
                    They were made from the defendant's                        
                    teeth, and the tests I conducted show                      
                    there's simply no other conclusion. The
                    bite marks on Miss Sandoval's body were
                    made by the defendant, Mr. Jay
                    Clifford...
          
          That's it. The Court erupts, flashbulbs exploding. Jay slumps back
          in his chair, his air of cool gone in an instant. He looks back at
          Marie, utter disbelief on his face. The tears well in her eyes...
          
          The Judge bangs his gavel in a vain attempt to regain control.

                    Clifford remained defiant. It's thought
                    that his stepdaughter, Marie Clifford
                    will testify in his defense tomorrow. And
                    in other news, officials from the FBI
                    gave a press conference today, commenting

          desk, piled high with files, mostly marked BLACK WIDOW, and
          reaches down to pick up Jay's broken video camera, still in the
          evidence bag...

          Kristen smiles, enters Morrison's cluttered office.

          Morrison shakes the broken camera parts in the evidence bag.

                    Chad, I got a rush job for you.
          
          Chad rolls his eyes.
          
                              CHAD
                    No can do, boss. We're sifting through
                    the Black Widow evidence...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Feds are movin' in. They'll be taking
                    over by the case by the end of the week.
          
          Chad's dumbstruck, but dutifully takes the shattered video camera.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You find anything on that tape, you let
                    me know, OK?
          
                              CHAD
                    Whatever you say, boss.
          
                              MORRISON
                    And make sure you get that money back
                    into the evidence locker.
          A
           nd Chad's left alone with the shattered remains of the video
          camera, and a whole shit load of work ahead...
          
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - DAY
          
          The early morning sun casts a brilliant orange glow over the
          smooth-as-glass surface of the school swimming pool.
          
          Marie steps back up onto the high diving platform. Tries to focus.
          Slides the soon-to-be-diamond ring off her finger and throws it
          tentatively into the water...
          
          She takes a breath and then dives, straight and true, into the
          perfect blue water below.
          
          EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie's lithe, taught body comes arcing through the water, darting
          down to the bottom of the pool to retrieve the ring...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie surfaces, reaches out and puts the ring on the side of the
          pool, before looking up to see an old pair of sneakers, an
          electronic ankle bracelet locked around one leg.
          
                                                         03/22/2004     32.
          
          
          
                               ELENA
                    Nice take off. Gotta work on the
                    landing...
          
          Marie's blood boils.
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell are you doing here?
          
          Elena just reaches down and picks up Marie's unfinished ring.
          
                              ELENA
                    Looks like your bling ain't blinging...
          
                              MARIE
                    Give me that back. It was my Mother's...
          
          Marie climbs out of the pool, faces down with Elena...
          
                              ELENA
                    Looks like she got ripped off Princess,
                    where's the rock?
          
          Marie snatches the ring from Elena, slides it back on her finger.
          
                              MARIE
                    Is that what this is all about?
          
          Elena reaches out, tries to stroke the wet hair off Marie's face.
          She recoils before she'll let Elena touch her...
          
                              ELENA
                    You're not a dumb as you look...
          J
           enny, followed by the rest of the diving team, come marching out
          of the locker room and see the two arch-enemies confronting each
          other.
          
                              JENNY
                        (to her team mates)
                    We got trouble...
          
          Elena won't back down.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're ruining my life, and my
                    stepfather's.
          
                              ELENA
                    It can end. Just like that.
          
          She snaps her fingers and Marie's on the verge of tears...
          
                                                         03/22/2004   33.
          
          
          
          Jenny and the rest of the diving team approach, stand behind
          Marie, a seething mass of bikini-clad mindless hate...
          
                              MARIE
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              ELENA
                    Because I can.
          
          As she turns and walks away...
          
                              ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Good luck in court.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY COURTROOM - DAY
          
          The usual assortment of paparazzi and spectators crowd into the
          small courtroom.
          
          Marie is on the witness stand, staring straight ahead at her
          stepfather at the defendant's table. Gone is the immaculate suit,
          the perfect hair, the poker face. He's looking worried now...
          
          Theo paces in front of Marie, running her through a series of well-
          rehearsed questions.
          
                              THEO
                    And why did you go to your stepfather's
                    building site that night, Miss Clifford?
          
                              MARIE
                    It was my birthday. Jay left the party
                    before giving me my present.
          
                              THEO
                    And you say you saw Miss Sandoval
                    leaving?
          
          Marie takes a moment, looks to Elena at the Prosecution table.
          
                              MARIE
                    I did.
          
                              THEO
                    And how would you describe her
                    appearance?
          
                              MARIE
                    She was...she looked fine. She smiled at
                    me. Actually smiled...
          
                              THEO
                    No further questions.
          
                                                          03/22/2004   34.
          
          
          
          He takes a seat next to Jay, whispers in his ear. D.A. Meese
          starts his cross-examination.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Would it be fair to say you don't like
                    Elena Sandoval, Miss Clifford?
                              M
                              MARIE
                    We don't see...eye to eye...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Is that why you attacked her at your
                    party earlier that night?
          
          Marie squirms.
          
                              MARIE
                    No...I was...she wasn't invited...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    You'd had a few drinks, correct?
          
                              MARIE
                        (reluctantly)
                    I'd had a drink. Yes.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    So by the time you allege to have seen
                    Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court
                    exactly how much you'd had to drink?
          
                              MARIE
                    A glass of Champagne. Or two, but...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    No further questions.
          
          Jay sinks a few inches lower in his seat. Going down...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - DAY
          
          A bleary eyed Chad sits in front of a bank of monitors, working
          the image enhancement equipment, fighting to get a watchable
          picture from the fuzzy static in front of him. Kristen sits behind
          him, fighting to stay awake.
          
                              CHAD
                        (to himself)
                    Take out the chroma, raise the
                    luminescence...
          
          He clumsily reaches over the control panel, hitting almost every
          button on the way. And that does the trick...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   35.
          
          
          
          Suddenly the picture on the monitors becomes clear. Kristen's eyes
          snap open.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    H
                     oly shit...
          
          The pixilated image of Elena smiling comes into focus on the TV...
          
                              KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                    Call Detective Morrison. Now...
          
          SCENE OMITTED
          
          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS- DAY
          
          The shaky, pixilated image of Elena smiling flickers on the TV.
          Soon enough though her smile fades...
          
                              ELENA (ON TAPE)
                    You're kidding right?
          
          Jay's voice can be heard behind the camera...
          
                              JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          The video shows Elena cowering...
          
                              ELENA (ON TAPE)
                    Please...you can't do this...
          
                              JAY (O.S ON TAPE)
                    No such word as can't...
          
          A hand reaches out from behind the video camera and grabs Elena,
          throws her violently against a concrete wall.
          
                                 JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)
                    Fuck me...
          
          A flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus. When the
          camera steadies again, Elena's hands are pressed against the wall
          and she's sobbing... E
          
                               LENA (ON TAPE)
                    Please, Mr. Clifford, don't...
          
                              JAY (O.S ON TAPE)
                    Just try to keep those legs together...
          
          And then static...
          
                                                         03/22/2004   36.
          
          
          
          Pulling back from the TV we find ourselves in the courtroom,        
                                                                              
          completely empty, save for Jay, Theo, Meese and Judge Wilcox all
          staring in shock at the blank TV screen...                          
          
                                                                              
                              D.A. MEESE
                    If Mr. Clifford would plead guilty to                     
                    rape, the state is prepared to drop the                   
                                                                              
                    charges of kidnapping and assault.

                        (to Jay)
                    If I were you I would seriously consider                  
                    the offer.                                                
          INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY
          
          In the cold stone jail visiting room, Jay sits behind the wire
          mesh, an emotion Marie and Theo opposite. The PRISON GUARD waits
          by the barred door, keeping his beady eyes on Jay.
          
                              JAY
                    I'm gonna lose this trial.
          
                              THEO
                    I'm not so sure about that. The tape's a
                    fake, right? So all we need to do is...
          
          Jay holds up a hand, instantly silencing his attorney.
          
                              JAY
                    You had your chance.
                        (to Marie)
                    If we're gonna win at all costs, we're
                    gonna have to change the game.
                        (to Theo)
                    Do you have it?
          
          Theo nods regretfully, reaches into a breast pocket, pulls out a
          KEY.
          
                              THEO
                    I'm still dead set against this, Jay.
          
                              JAY
                    I couldn't care less.

                    What's the key for?
          
                              JAY
                    The diamonds...If that's what it takes,
                    then that's what it takes...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   37.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    But...they're my inheritance...
          
                              JAY
                    All my assets are tied up in the condos,
                    Marie. We have to pay this girl off, make
                    her testify that she faked the tape,
                    faked the evidence.
          
                              MARIE
                    But, Jay...they're my diamonds...
          
                              JAY
                    As soon as I'm out of here, you'll have
                    them back. I swear. I know people, who
                    can...persuade her to hand them over...
          
          Marie shoots an uncomfortable look to Theo, then back at Jay,
          uncertain what to say.
          
                              MARIE
                    I
                     t's wrong.
          
                              JAY
                    More wrong than what she's doing to us?
                    We're team Clifford, right? You know I'm
                    not guilty. You know I could never do
                    anything like this. So do the right thing
                    and get me out of this hellhole...
          
          Marie's cracking...
          
                                 MARIE
                    I can't...
          
                              JAY
                        (tenderly)
                    No such word as 'can't.' Please...
          
          The tears well in her eyes.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
          
          The key slips easily into the lock below the dazzling Mother
          Daughter diamonds. The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to
          reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems...
          
          The Curator stands behind her in the empty Museum hall, ruefully
          watching his prize exhibit being removed.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I knew the day would come, still doesn't
                    make it any easier...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   38.
          
          
          
          Marie, tears welling in her eyes, takes a hold of the diamonds,
          carefully takes them from the case.
          
                              CURATOR
                    The offer still stands, Marie. If you
                    ever decide to sell them, please give us
                    a first chance...
          
          Marie turns to him, the emotions overwhelming her.
          
                              MARIE
                    I don't think I'll be able to, I'm
                    sorry...
          
          She scampers towards the door, past the security guards.
          
                              CURATOR
                        (sotto)
                    Me too...
          
          EXT. THE GATOR TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
          
          Theo's SUV drives carefully down the mud path running parallel to
          the swamp, past countless rusted airboats, and into the 'GATOR'
          trailer park, finally coming to a halt in front of Elena's rotting
          trailer. Theo gets out carefully, his $1000 shoes sinking into the
          mud. Marie reluctantly steps out of the car...
          
          A blinding PORCH LIGHT flicks on. Theo and Marie spin round,
          squint through the light to see Elena standing in her trailer
          doorway...           E
                               LENA
                    Well, well, well. Look what the cat
                    dragged in...
                        (to Theo)
                    DA know you're here?
          
          Theo squirms...
          
                              MARIE
                    We need to talk.
          
                               ELENA
                    So talk.
          
                              THEO
                    Somewhere private, maybe?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   39.
          
          
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          An elderly man, UNCLE MARTY, in a sweat-stained T-shirt and ratty
          underwear, snores on the tattered recliner, a half-drunk bottle of
          WHISKY hanging from one limp hand...
          
          Theo freezes when he sees him...
          
                              THEO
                    Who's this?
          
                              ELENA
                    Uncle Marty. Legal Guardian. Drunken
                    pervert, take your pick. Chill. He's out
                    til morning.
          
          Uncle Marty's deafening SNORES confirm the assertion as Elena
          leads them into her bedroom...
          
                              MARIE
                    Let's just get this over with.
                        (to Elena)
                    You won. You got what you wanted...
          
                              ELENA
                        (mocking)
                    I just wanted justice...
          
                              THEO
                    Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the
                    jury you faked the evidence, faked the
                    tape...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sarcastic)
                    Really?
          
                              MARIE
                    We are prepared to make it worth your
                    while.
          
          She holds the Daughter diamond in front of Elena's greedy little
          eyes.
          
                              ELENA
                        (poker face)
                    Not bad. But I always wanted a family...
          
          Theo nudges Marie. She sighs, holds out the Mother diamond in the
          other hand. A broad grin stretches across Elena's face.
          
          F
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   40.
          
          
          
                              THEO
                    They're yours after you exonerate my
                    client.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'm afraid I'm gonna need that payment up
                    front.
          
                              MARIE
                    No, that's not the deal.
          
                              ELENA
                    It is now. Take it or leave it.
          
          Marie takes a deep breath. It's the most difficult thing she's
          ever had to do in her young life. Dead silence, except for Uncle
          Marty's snoring from the front room.
          
           inally, with a very heavy heart, Marie hands over the diamonds.
          
                              THEO
                    When this is all over, you'll leave town.
                    For good.
          
          Elena points to the ankle bracelet.
          
                              ELENA
                    I go more than five miles from the police
                    station and I'm straight back in juvie...
          
                              THEO
                    I understand your Parole term is up next
                    week.
          
          Elena smiles.
          
                              ELENA
                    You've done your homework. Fine.
                        (points to the ankle bracelet)
                    As soon as this thing comes off, I'm
                    outta here...
          
          She reaches down and grabs the diamonds. Dances past Marie...
          
                              THEO
                    May I suggest a little discretion, Miss
                    Sandoval. Certain...questions might be
                    asked about this...arrangement if you
                    were to...say...turn up to Blue Bay High
                    wearing a tiara...
          
          Elena winks.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   41.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    I ain't gonna flaunt it, mate. I gots too
                    much class for that shit.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're going to tell the truth on the
                    stand tomorrow, yes?
          
          Elena raises her right hand...
          
                              ELENA
                    I swear to tell the truth, the whole
                    truth and nothing but the truth...
          
          INT. COURTROOM - DAY
          
          The court Bailiff nods, takes the Bible from Elena's hands. She's
          dressed in the closest thing to a modest suit she has in her
          wardrobe; a low cut jacket and tiny miniskirt...
          
          The courtroom is packed with journalists, TV cameras and nosey
          neighbors. Everyone wants a piece of this story. At the
          defendant's table, Jay, slick once more in Armani, watches Theo
          approach the witness box with a new-found confidence.
          
          Sitting in the front row of the public gallery, Marie is riveted
          on the action. At the back of the courtroom, Kristen fidgets
          nervously beside Morrison as Theo steps up, ready to question the
          newly compliant star witness in this sensational rape trial...
          
                              THEO
                    It's your assertion that my client, Mr.
                    Clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you
                    on the night of the 25th. Is that true?
          
          A hushed silence. Marie, Jay, Theo all wait expectantly...
          
                              THEO
                    Is that what you say happened?
          
          Elena clears her throat.
          
                              ELENA
                    He... He didn't...
          
          A collective intake of breath from the crowd.
          
                              ELENA
                    ....just sexually assault me.
          
          Theo's balls shrink instantly.
          
                                                         03/22/2004   42.
          
          
          
                              THEO
                    What...did you just say?
          
                              ELENA
                    He didn't just sexually assault me. He
                    threatened to kill me if I told anyone...
          T
           he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. Theo's
          reeling, caught off-guard, stumbling over his words, trying to
          give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise.
          
                              THEO
                    Isn't it true that you were inebriated
                    during the assault, that it may not in
                    fact have been Mr. Clifford...Or anyone?
          
          A smirking Meese doesn't even bother to stand up.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Objection. Leading the witness.
          
                              JUDGE WILCOX
                    Sustained. Council will please rephrase
                    the question.
          
          Theo's stumped. His eyes plead with Elena to take the ball and run
          with it. She does. Unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone.
          
                              ELENA
                    I was messed up, alright. In fact, only
                    two things I remember. One was that
                    bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that
                    Goddamn video camera while he violated
                    me. The other was what he whispered in my
                    ear, right before I blacked out...
          
          She pauses, for emphasis. Judge, jury, gallery, press corps, the
          town of Blue Bay, the state of Florida hangs on her every word...
          
                              ELENA
                    He said, "You won't remember, but you'll
                    never forget."
          
          That's it. The court goes berserk, flashbulbs exploding, along
          with the veins in Jay's head.
          
          Kristen's reeling from shock...
          
                              KRISTEN
                        (to Morrison)
                    What did she just say?
          
          Marie leaps to her feet, screams...

                    Lying bitch!
          
          Marie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to
          claw Elena's tear stained eyes out...

          A small Television blares out today's top story...
          
                              ACTION NEWS ANCHOR
                    The young victim's wrenching testimonial
                    proved to be the final nail in the coffin
                    for Jay Clifford. It took less than an
                    hour for the jury to deliberate and
                    sentence Mr. Clifford to 15 years.
          T
           V cameras witness Jay being led away in handcuffs...
          
                              JAY (ON TV)
                    You can't do this to me! You can't...YOU
                    CAN'T!
          
          CLICK. The TV turns off. Marie sits huddled in Jay's unfinished
          concrete building site office, staring at the darkened television
          set. Mascara laden tear tracks line her perfect face.
          
                              MARIE
                        (mumbling)
                    No such thing as can't...
          
          She lets the champagne bottle slip through her fingers and it
          smashes on the concrete floor. Strangely the dregs of the
          champagne start running down the floor...
          
          Marie's heart suddenly skips a beat as she thinks she hears the
          rustling of plastic from outside the office.
          
                              MARIE
                    Who's there?
          
          No answer. She steels herself, gets shakily to her feet, stumbling
          drunkenly toward the door...
          
          EXT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen stands in the darkened doorway of Elena's less-than-
          welcoming trailer. She knocks.

          No answer. She tries the door handle. It's unlocked. She takes a
          deep breath, steps inside.
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen flips on a light switch. The room is illuminated for a
          split second before the bulb surges and burns out, leaving Kristen
          in the near-darkness...
          
                               KRISTEN
                    Elena?   Hello?
          
          She takes out a FLASHLIGHT, creeps through the front room,
          stepping over the discarded pizza boxes and assorted detritus.
          
          The beam of light finds a small BLUE PILL nestled in the
          carpeting. Kristen picks it up, slides it into her pocket...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Marie steps cautiously through the unfinished concrete top floor,
          past the crime scene tape. In the dim light, her eyes dart to
          every corner, every shadow.
          S
           he lets out a surprised shout as the room is suddenly plunged
          into darkness. Slowly the eerie forensic ULTRA VIOLET LIGHTS
          switch on, filling the room with black light.
          
          And with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach, Marie slowly
          turns, coming face to face with...
          
          Elena, her arch-nemesis...
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen moves slowly into Elena's bedroom, shines her light on the
          walls. What she sees makes the blood run chill in her veins.
          Barely able to breathe, she takes out her cell phone.

          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elena and Marie stare each other down. You could cut the tension
          with a chainsaw, until...
          
                              MARIE
                    Who invited you?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   45.
          
          
          
          A sinister grin spreads across Elena's face as she holds up the
          breathtaking Mother-Daughter diamonds, reflecting an unearthly
          glow under the UV lights.
          
                              ELENA
                    Mother and Daughter...
          
          This brings a mile-wide smile to Marie as she dances into Elena's
          arms. Their lips come together in a passionate kiss as their hands
          dance over each other's trembling bodies. When they finally
          break...
          
                              MARIE
                    I was sure you'd blow it on the stand,
                    going on about forgetting and
                    remembering.
          
                              ELENA
                    Gotta make it seem authentic. God's in
                    the details.
          
          And they kiss again, lips locked tighter than Jay's jail cell...

          Morrison's unmarked sedan pulls to a stop beside Kristen's car,
          and the harried Detective steps out, looking extremely unhappy.

          Elena and Marie are locked in their carnal embrace, failing to
          notice the florescent lights flickering back on. Suddenly Elena
          feels the sharp pain of teeth biting into her neck...
          
          She looks down to see DENTAL ALGINATE MOLDINGS of Jay's teeth
          being held by a smiling Chad.
          
                              CHAD
                    Mind if Chad joins?
          
          The girls look up to see a beaming Chad, holding the teeth
          molding. Elena just shakes her head...

          He sets the dentures down on the concrete floor, and takes in the
          sight of the magnificent diamonds.

          hold their breath, praying he doesn't see them, standing in

                    questions. I've noticed some

                    Here's one big fucking glaring
                    inconsistency for you: I was set up!
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Maybe so, but that's not good enough. Why
                    were you set up? What would Elena
                    Sandoval have gained from all this?
          
          Jay hesitates, unsure how, or if, to proceed. Theo shifts
          nervously. Jay gives J

                    much worse can it get? I paid her off,
                    okay? My assets were tied up in the

                    little skank probably figured she could
                    bleed me for some more money down the
                    road. But I'll tell you this much, I'm
                    gonna get those diamonds back, make her
                    wish she was never born.

          nowhere. She cuts the engine, lets the boat drift, unwraps the
          moldings of Jay's teeth from a cloth, as well as a VIDEO TAPE
          marked "BLUE BAY DIVING MEET/MARIE'S BIRTHDAY", looks them over
          one last time...
          
                              ELENA
                    Later potato...
          
          And tosses them into the mire, where they're soon gobbled by
          ravenous Gators...
          
          EXT. GATOR TRAILER PARK - MORNING
          
          Elena glides her airboat to a stop on the muddy banks of the
          trailer park, stomps over to her trailer, when she sees...
          
          Two sets of tire tracks in the mud.
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - MORNING
          
          Elena stands in her bedroom, disbelief washing over her. No sign
          of the newspaper articles. Her walls are barren.
                               E
                                  LENA
                        (sotto)
                    Oh shit...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - DAY
          
          The diving team emerges from the locker room on their way to
          practice. Lagging behind is Marie. She's about to catch up when
          she runs smack dab into a panicked Elena.
          
                              MARIE
                    What the...If anyone sees us together...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   50.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    What choice did I have? We got big
                    problems...
          
          Before anyone can see them, Marie pulls her away, to the outdoor
          shower area, out of sight from her teammates. She turns on all
          the shower heads.
          
                              MARIE
                    Gotta be careful. Make sure no one's
                    listening. Now what's the 411?
          
                              ELENA
                    I...I think I fucked up...
          
          Marie gently takes a hold of Elena's face.
          
                              MARIE
                    How?
          
                              ELENA
                    I don't know for sure...but I think that
                    bitch Parole officer's made me...she was
                    at my trailer last night...
          
          Marie smiles, pulls Elena close as the steam rises all around.
          
                              MARIE
                    No bigee. You disposed of everything,
                    right? The teeth, the video, all the
                    research...
          
          Elena can't fess up. Not now...
          
                              ELENA
                    I did, but...She's got a hard on for me.
                    Wants to see me back in Juvie...
          
          Marie kisses her softly on the forehead. Her cheek.
          
                              MARIE
                    I won't let the big bad wolf get you. I
                    promise.
          
          Elena's damp tank top clings to her perfect body.
          
                              ELENA
                    I just want outta here.
          
          Marie brushes a strand of hair away from Elena's face.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   51.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    Be patient. I'll call the Museum Curator,
                    have him prepare the funds to buy back
                    the diamonds...
          
                              ELENA
                    Then we're outta here, right?
          
          A mile wide smile stretches across Marie's lips...
          
                              MARIE
                    Just sit back, relax, enjoy the
                    trip...Don't forget to come again.
          T
           heir trembling lips come together like wet hot magnets...
          
          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
          
          Sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface, illuminating Marie's
          lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until...
          
          Marie comes diving down into the crystalline water, plucks the
          soon-to-be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - DAY
          
          Marie surfaces at the edge of the pool. She places the ring onto
          the deck, pulls herself out of the water.
          
          She tries not to show surprise when she comes face to face with
          Kristen, who's picked up her ring, runs it around her fingers...
          
                              MARIE
                    Can I help you?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I was wondering if I could have a moment
                    of your time. Ask a couple questions.
          
          Marie glances nervously back at the pool, where other members of
          the diving team go about their workout.
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm in the middle of practice...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It'll only take a moment, Marie. Might
                    even help Jay. Remember your loving
                    stepfather? You want to help him, don't
                    you?
          
                                 MARIE
                    Of course.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   52.
          
          
          
          Kristen studies the ring for a moment, then ventures...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Why'd you agree to part with your
                    diamonds?
          
          This time Marie can't hide her shock.
          
                              MARIE
                    How...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Jay told me. But why? They were your
                    inheritance.
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay needed help. We're a team.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Team Clifford. Right. It's just...You
                    must've been pretty unhappy when Jay
                    didn't give you those diamonds for your
                    birthday.
          M
          Marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing.
          
                              MARIE
                    He said I wasn't ready.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're 18. That's heiress payday, no?
                    Must've crossed your mind that Jay might
                    never let you have them...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, of course not.
          
          She's a bad liar.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And then this little scam artist saunters
                    in and just takes them. With your help,
                    no less.
          
          Kristen moves in for the kill.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    But what I don't get is, why wouldn't
                    Elena do what Jay asked, clear his name?
                    After all, she'd gotten what she wanted.
          
                              MARIE
                    How should I know?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   53.
          
          
          
          Marie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the
          ring against the back of her hand. Hard. Winces, then...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I mean, the only way I can make sense of
                    it is if somehow getting Jay released
                    from prison would spoil the plan.
          
                                 MARIE
                    What plan?
          
          She hands the ring back to Marie. Not so lucky anymore...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You tell me...
          I
          INT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Chad strolls gingerly down the hallway, opens the door to the
          forensics lab, freezing when he sees...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD FORENSICS - DAY
          
          Kristen, waiting patiently for him.
          
                              CHAD
                    Miss...Richards. Is...Is there something
                    I can do for you?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I was wondering if you'd do me the favor
                    of running a quick test.
          
                              CHAD
                    Uh, sure, I guess. Whatcha got for me?
          
          She hands him the Blue Pill she found in Elena's trailer.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Could you tell me what this is?
          
          Chad tries to keep his cool.
          
                              CHAD
                    No problemo. It'll only take a minute.
          
          While Chad goes about his work, Kristen begins nosing around the
          office. Chad looks over his shoulder.
          
                              CHAD
                    Be careful, I got lots of evidence here.
          
          She starts flipping through EVIDENCE PHOTOS...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   54.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Are these the evidence photos from the
                    Elena Sandoval rape?
          
                              CHAD
                    They are, but...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Ever find out what caused these markings?
          
          She holds up the photograph of the four circular indentations the
          Judge questioned Chad about in court...
          
                              CHAD
                    Like I told the Judge, I guess they're
                    finger nail markings...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    They don't look like finger nail markings
                    to me. They look more like this...
          
          She holds up the back of her hand, where she'd made the
          indentation with Marie's ring.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Would you say these markings are the
                    same?
          
                              CHAD
                    W-where did you get that?
          
          Kristen smiles.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Marie gave it to me. But you already knew
                    that, didn't you, Doc?
          
          Chad has no answer to that. He can only blink stupidly and pray
          his silence doesn't incriminate him further. Kristen heads for the
          door...
          
                              CHAD
                        (calling after)
                    The pill. It's Rohypnol. Uh, Roofies.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Been there. Done that.
          
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - NIGHT
          
          The massive front door swings open and Marie crosses the foyer,
          and is about to ascend the magnificent staircases when she hears
          the clanking of glass coming from the kitchen.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   55.
          
          
          
          Her heart is in her throat as she calls out...
          
                                 MARIE
                       Hello?
          
          No answer.
          
                                                                               
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Marie enters the lavish kitchen, stops in her tracks when she sees
          Chad standing at the full bar, mixing the strongest drink known to
          man.
          
                                 MARIE
                       What the hell, Chad?                                    
          Chad fidgets nervously.
          
                                 CHAD
                       That parole officer was sniffin' around
                       today.
          
          Marie scoffs, steps up to the bar, gets in Chad's face.
          
                                 MARIE
                       Not you too. She's just trying to prove
                       her worthless excuse for an existence.
                       She doesn't have a thing on us.
          
                                 CHAD
                       Yeah, but she's askin' the right
                       questions. It's only a matter of time. We
                       gotta make our move.
          
          Marie shakes her head, resolute.
          
                                 MARIE
                       No. We stick to the plan. Give the
                       Curator time to come up with the money...
          
          Chad's trembling hands pour the drink, most of the liquid making
          it in to two MARTINI GLASSES...
          
                                 CHAD
                       We gotta move fast, keep the heat off...
          
                                 MARIE
                       You can't take the heat, get outta the
                       kitchen.
          
                                 CHAD                                          
                       I wanna see 'em. The diamonds.   Make                   
                       sure they're safe.                                      
          
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
          
          
          
          
                                                                       56.
          
          
          
                              MARIE                                                
                                                                                   
                    They're safe.
          
          She downs half the drink in one giant gulp.
          
                              CHAD                                                 
                    I just wanna see 'em. I thought we were                        
                                                                                   
                    supposed to be partners here.
          
          Chad's trembling, looking like he could lose it at any second.
          
                              MARIE                                                
                    You're gonna be the death of me...                             
          She slugs the rest of the drink, strides away and Chad follows           
          like a lapdog...                                                         
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                             
          Nothing's been touched in Jay's office, the drops of blood the           
          Cubans extracted from his thumb as a warning stain the white             
          carpet black...                                                          
          Marie walks over to his desk, opens a draw. Removes a metallic           
          lock box.                                                                
                              CHAD                                                 
                    Open it. I wanna see those puppies.                            
          Marie rolls her eyes, takes a key from a delicate chain around her 
          neck and fumbles with the lock. Finally she opens the box,         
          revealing the Mother-Daughter diamonds, resting on velvet lining.  
          
          The sparkling diamonds seem to have a calming effect on Chad.      He
          stops shaking, his voice becoming more steady...                         
                              CHAD
                    I called the museum. The deal's goin'
                    down tomorrow. 8 am...
          
          Marie stumbles as she takes a step toward him.
          
                              MARIE
                    What did you...
          
          She looks to the empty glass in her hand, then begins to sway,           
          watching in horror as Chad drops the diamonds into his pocket...
                               C
                               HAD
                    I'm sorry, okay? But it's not like I had
                    a choice.

          Marie falls flat on her face, her world crashing to BLACK.

          EXT. EVERGLADES - MORNING
          
          The blinding morning sunlight climbs the horizon, the still water
          of the endless swampland glistening like diamonds...
          
          Elena sits out on her idling airboat, in the midst of the
          sawgrass, smoking. The peace is shattered by her ringing
          CELLPHONE.
          
                               ELENA
                    Yello...
          
                                                                               
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - JAY'S OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Marie has the phone cradled between her shoulder and ear, rubbing  
          her aching head, slowly getting her wits back. Nothing like good
          old fashioned vengeful rage to combat a nasty hangover.
          
                              MARIE
                        (into phone)
                    Chad fucked us.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                        (deadpan)
                    I know. I was there...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, I mean he really fucked us. He
                    drugged me an' took the diamonds!
          
          EXT. SWAMPS - MORNING
          
          Elena stands on the edge of the airboat, fear rising in her.
          
                              ELENA
                     ell me you're kidding...
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Yeah, it's all a big joke...He stole the
                    diamonds!
          
          Elena lets out an anguished wail.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as
                    it is.
          
                              ELENA
                    We've gotta stop him.

          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - KITCHEN - MORNING
          
          Marie's fevered mind is racing as she glances at the wall clock.
          7:30. Finally a desperate plan scratches its way to the surface.
          
                              MARIE
                    He's heading to the museum, got himself
                    an 8am meeting...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    He's gonna sell the diamonds...
          
                              MARIE
                    Not if we find him first...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          The deafening roar of an air boat cutting through dense sawgrass,
          speeding across the endless swampland expanse. Elena expertly
          maneuvers the machine, the wind racing through her hair...
          
          EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
          
          Chad's speakers blare out heavy metal as his rusty DAEWOO bangs
          down the desolate swamp dirt road through the thick trees. Every
          hundred feet or so, the road runs parallel with the water, then
          cuts back into the trees.
          C
           had spots an Air Boat not more than a few hundred yards from him.
          He does a double take just as the road disappears back into the
          trees. That wasn't...it couldn't be, could it?
          
          The winding dirt road crosses back to swampside and Chad's worst
          fears come true...Elena's racing along side of him in the AIRBOAT,
          fighting to keep up...
          
                                 ELENA
                    Pull over!
          
          INT. CHAD'S CAR - DAY
          
          The road runs parallel to the swamp again and Chad's eyes nearly
          burst from their sockets as he sees the airboat now alongside him,
          matching his speed.
          
                              ELENA
                    Give us back the diamonds!
          
          Chad's heart stops.
          
                                 CHAD
                    Us?
          
                                                           03/22/2004   59.
          
          
          
          He spins round, looks straight ahead at the BMW RACING RIGHT AT
          HIM!
          
                              CHAD
                    FUCKING HELL!
          
          He yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off
          the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's
          BMW shoots past, missing his car by inches...
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie slams on her brakes, brings her BMW to a skidding halt on
          the dirt road. She looks back over her shoulder, at the swaying
          Melaluca trees. No sign of Chad's car...
          
          EXT. SWAMPSIDE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Elena brings the airboat to rest at swamp side, leaps into the
          reeds and clambers up to the dirt road. There's no sign of Chad's
          car, just a hole in the dense undergrowth where it ploughed
          through...
          
          Marie comes running up to join Elena, a tire iron in hand...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sternly)
                    We're not hurting him, Marie, got it? We
                    just get the diamonds back...
          
                              MARIE
                    I
                     'm not gonna hurt him. No way...
          
          Marie stalks down the path Chad's car took off the dirt road...
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm gonna kill him.
          
          Elena's breath catches in her throat. Marie disappears into the
          trees and she's alone, out on the deserted swamp road...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie! Don't do this...
          
          She hears a scream, a girl's scream...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie!
          
          Elena sprints into the thick of the trees...
          
                                                              03/22/2004   60.
          
          
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD OFFICES - DAY
          
          Kristen is sitting at Detective Morrison's cluttered desk, her
          brow furrowed as she shuffles through the stack of newspaper
          articles she pulled from Elena's wall.
          
          Morrison stands in the doorway, watching her.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You look like you could use a drink.
          
          Kristen looks up from the articles, into Morrison's smiling face.
          She smiles back.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    When this is all over, I'd like that.
          
          Morrison turns and walks right into a suit with an FBI badge
          identifying him as AGENT MILTON DAMMERS. The buzzcut agent drops
          BOXES at Morrison's feet.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    More Black Widow leads. I need you to put
                    them in the evidence locker, Morrison.
          
                              MORRISON
                    That's not my job, Agent Dammers.
          
                                 DAMMERS
                    It is now.
          
          EXT. SWAMP CLEARING - DAY
          
          Marie is standing in a clearing, staring at Chad's wrecked car, at
          the top of a small slope, wrapped around a Melaluca tree like a
          Christmas present.
          
          Her piercing screams force Elena to come running...
          
                                 ELENA
                    You okay?
          
          Marie stops screaming, her face contorting in anger...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, I'm pretty damn far from okay...
          
          She points to the front seat of the crashed car...
          
          Elena can barely bring herself to look inside. Marie shoves her in
          the back, pushing her towards the open driver's side door. Elena
          gasps when she looks inside the car. Chad's not there.

                    He bolted...
          
          Marie clambers up the wreckage of the car, stands on the roof. She
                               M
          surveys the swamp all around her like the lioness she is...
          
                              MARIE
                    With the diamonds.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
          
          Morrison grumbles as he scans his key card, opening the wire mesh
          door to the evidence locker. He picks up a box and enters,
          Kristen, also carrying a box, a step behind.
          
                              MORRISON
                    I appreciate the help...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Right back at ya.
          
          Morrison blushes as he absently adds the boxes to the groaning
          shelves stuffed with Black Widow evidence. Kristen notices the
          bundles of cash stored in and amongst the Black Widow evidence...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You could have a helluva holiday on that
                    money.
          
                               MORRISON
                    Recovered from the Black Widow's last
                    score. If I'd gotten to the scene just
                    five minutes earlier, I woulda gotten her
                    as well...
          
          Morrison shakes his head, ruefully, when a sudden sharp beeping
          has Kristen reaching into her pocket, fishing out a handheld GPS.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    What the hell...
          
          A red flashing dot moves quickly in the middle of the map...

          Elena runs full pelt after Marie, through dense swampland, the
          plastic ankle bracelet around her leg silently flashing red...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   62.

                    Chad! There's nowhere to run to, you
                    little weasel!
          
          She swings around, finally spotting a bloody hand print on one of
          the ashen tree trunks...
          
                                MARIE
                    Gotcha...
          
          She races off in hot pursuit. Elena's about to follow when she
          notices the red light flashing on her ankle bracelet...
          
                              ELENA
                    This can't be happening...
          
          Marie slows, looks back to Elena.
          
                                MARIE
                    What now?
          
                              ELENA
                    I'm more than five miles away from the
                    Police station. I go beyond five miles
                    and the alarm goes off...
          
          Marie snarls...
          
                              MARIE
                    You telling me your Parole Officer knows
                    you're out here?
          
          Elena can barely speak...
          
                              ELENA
                    She knows...
          
          EXT. SWAMP - DAY
          
          Chad's face is drained of color as he runs through the dense
          swampland, hugging the priceless diamonds. Sweat cascades from his
          brow, and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body
          swirl in the stagnant waters...
          
          Most gruesome of all is a broken TURN SIGNAL embedded in his right
          leg. As the water gets knee-deep, the last of Chad's reserve
          energy goes. He collapses in the stagnant marsh.
          
          Not far off, GATORS circle. It's only a matter of time before they
          notice the blood in the water.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   63.
          
          
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          The small bit of solid ground gives way to swampland. Elena steps
          into the water, her Ankle Bracelet FLASHING RED.
          
                              ELENA
                    Call it off, Marie. We gotta go or
                    she'll find us here...
          
          A splashing sound from up ahead silences both girls...
          
                              MARIE
                    You hear that?
          
          The sound echoes off the dense trees. Marie points left.
          
                              MARIE
                    You go that way...
          
          Marie heads off in the opposite direction. Elena hesitates, wants
          to follow, but does as she's told, and goes left, soon enveloped
          by canopy of trees...
          
          INT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY
          
          Kristen blasts down the Blue Bay streets, a siren in the
          windshield blaring...
          
          The handheld GPS continues to monitor Elena's exact position in
          the midst of the swamp...

          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          Elena stumbles through the thick, stagnant water, scouring the
          horizon for any sign of Chad...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sotto)
                    Please...
          
          A rustling sound stops her in her tracks. Dead silence, until...
          
          A HAND GRABS HER LEG, AROUND THE FLASHING ANKLE BRACELET, DRAGS
          HER DOWN INTO THE SWAMP...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES CLEARING - DAY
          
          Marie hacks her way through the overgrown foliage with the tire
          iron, like a Prada clad big-game hunter...
          
                              MARIE
                        (calling out to Elena)
                    You see him?

          No reply, just her own voice echoing back...

                    Elena?
          
          She rolls her eyes.

                    Useless bitch...

          Kristen's unmarked car races across the desolate swamp road.
          
          INT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY
          
          She checks the flashing GPS signal. Getting closer...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          Elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water, gasps for
          breath. Looking down she sees Chad, holding on to her like his
          life depends on it. It does...
          
          He pulls her back down into the water, just as she catches a
          glance of the circling GATORS...
          
          Using her as leverage, Chad pulls himself out of the swamp,
          climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid
          ground...
          
          Elena coughs and splutters, floundering in the blood soaked water.
          The ravenous Gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy...
          
                              CHAD
                    Don't move! Don't splash, they can sense
                    you in the water, they'll rip you to
                    pieces...
          
          Elena freezes, looking round at the black eyes breaking the
          surface of the bloody water, gliding in for the kill...
          
                              ELENA
                    Hel..help me...
          
          She reaches out a hand to Chad, only a few feet away...
          H
           e hesitates, then reaches out to her. But stops short of grabbing
          her trembling hand. Just balls his fist, squeezing every last drop
          of blood out of the open wounds on his palm...
          
          The dark blood cascades down into the water around Elena...
          
                                                                       65.

                    No.
          
          And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws...
          
          WHACK!
          
          Chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose,
          ears and mouth. He falls forward, stiff as a board, and SPLASHES
          down into the water next to an apoplectic Elena. Behind him stands
          Marie, the BLOODY TIRE IRON in hand...
          
          Marie reaches out a hand, pulls Elena out of the water. She
          collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air...
          
                              MARIE
                    What are you doing? Our diamonds are
                    about to become dinner...
          
          Elena can't move, leaving Marie to wade into the swamp...

          Kristen approaches a fork in the swamp road at high speed. She
          checks the GPS scanner. It doesn't show her which way to turn...

                    Which way, which way...
          
          Split second decision. Left. She spins the wheel, takes the left
          hand fork...
          
          Bad choice. Just a few meters down the right fork is an abandoned
          BMW, an idle airboat, a crashed car, one dead man and two wild,
          wild things...
          
          EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
          
          Elena and Marie, soaked to the bone, drag Chad's cold, dead corpse
          out of the trees. Marie drops the body, heads straight for her
          abandoned BMW. Elena follows, stumbling through the vines, her
          clothes dripping wet, shivering more from nerves than cold...

                    I don't...I don't have a clue...
          
          Marie spins round, a vicious look in her eyes. She holds the blood
          soaked diamonds in her hand...
          
                              MARIE
                    Chad made us an appointment to sell
                    these. I'm gonna keep it...
          
          Elena looks down to her flashing ankle bracelet...
          
                              ELENA
                    It's only a matter of time before my
                    Parole Officer finds me...
          
          Marie turns back around, flings open the BMW door and gets in.
          
                              MARIE
                    Then I suggest you get to work...
          
          She fires up the powerful engine, speeds away in a cloud of dust,
          leaving Elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life...

          Elena struggles to drag Chad's bloody body back to his crashed
          car. The tail lights flicker, throwing an ominous red glow over
          the dense thicket of overhanging trees.

          With a Herculean effort she manages to stuff Chad's inert body
          into the driver's seat. She stumbles back, horrified at the grim
          tableau before her...
          
          EXT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie's car comes barreling into the parking lot outside the stone
          Museum building.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator paces back and forth, like an expectant father, in
          front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds.
          Marie bursts into the Museum, and he strides up to meet her,
          shocked when he sees Marie's covered in blood, sweat and guilt...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie? Are you alright?

          The Curator nods nervously.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I convinced the board of the
                    extraordinary circumstances
                    surrounding...

           he fishes in her bag for the diamonds...

                    I...I received a call from your
                    'associate'. He said he would be handling
                    the transaction.
          
                              MARIE
                    Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied
                    up at work. Completely swamped...
          
          The Curator nods, unsure if he inquire further...
          
          Marie finally pulls out two blood soaked Diamonds from her bag,
          thrusts them at the Curator. He screws up his wrinkled face,
          afraid to touch them...
          
                              MARIE
                    Calm down. It's just blood.
          
          EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          With trembling hands, Elena opens the trunk of Chad's crashed car.
          She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around
          inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground...
          
          She carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty
          feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match...
          
          She can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in
          fear...
          
          Finally she pulls out a MATCHBOOK, still sopping wet from the
          swamp. She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until,
          finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then
          smoulders out...
          
                              ELENA
                    Don't do this to me, please...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   68.
          
          
          
          In frustration, she runs back to Chad's car, looking desperately
          for a lighter, climbing all the way in. Because of the slight
          slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her.
          
          Elena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove
          compartment.
          
                              ELENA
                    You gotta have a lighter or some...
          
          She's cut off as the WRECKED CAR'S HORN BLARES OUT!
          
          Deafening, the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth. Elena's
          heart skips a beat. Chad's corpse has slumped forward against the
          steering wheel.
          
                               ELENA
                    Jesus...
          
          She struggles with all her might to pull Chad's body back off the
          horn...
          S
           ilence reigns once more. Elena takes short, sharp breaths. Looks
          over at Chad's body slumped to the side, leaning against the
          driver's side door...
          
                              ELENA
                    I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...
          
          Not as sorry as she's going to be...
          
          The match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to
          smoulder for a second, then REIGNITES!
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator carefully examines the diamond, turning it over and
          over in his hands. Marie stands over him, impatiently tapping her
          muddy shoe on the marble floor...
          
                               MARIE
                    So?
          
                              CURATOR
                    I...I'm not sure...
          
                              MARIE
                    Can you get the cash or not?
          
          The Curator looks up to her, bemused.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I can get the cash...it's just...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   69.
          
          
          
          Marie smiles a wicked grin.
          
                              MARIE
                    Then let's have those dead presidents...
          
          EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          The discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the
          ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of
          gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car...
          
          INSIDE THE CAR
          
          Elena reaches over, carefully closes Chad's bloodshot eyes.
          Satisfied, she turns to get out, only to find the passenger side
          door LOCKED...
          
          She tries the handle. Tries it again. Desperately yanks it. Not
          opening, no sir...
          
          Elena looks over, see Chad's limp elbow on the door lock...
          
          OUTSIDE THE CAR
          
          The small brush fire reaches the pooled gasoline and...WHOOSH!
          
          INSIDE THE CAR
          
          Elena can't help but hear the unmistakable sound of FLAMES
          CRACKLING. Through the smashed rear window she sees the line of
          FIRE racing towards the car she's trapped in!
          
          She reaches over, clawing her way past Chad's corpse, trying to
          reach the door lock. Her bloody fingers slip on the lock, unable
          to pull it up.
          
          THE FIRE's SHOOTING towards the crashed car, only a few feet
          away...
          
          Elena fumbles with the lock, tears streaming down her face.
          
          The line of fire hits the crashed car, and ENGULFS it instantly.
          Bright ORANGE FLAMES cover the wreckage...
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator carefully sets down the diamonds on the marble floor.
          Marie looks at him like he's mad.
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                                                             03/22/2004   70.
          
          
          
                              CURATOR
                    One last test...
          
          The Curator hovers his heel over the biggest Diamond. Marie
          screams out!
          
                                MARIE
                    NO!
          
          He slams his foot down and the DIAMOND SHATTERS!
          
          INT. CHAD'S CRASHED CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          Elena SCREAMS as the passenger side window next to her SMASHES,
          SPLINTERING into a million glass fragments.
          
          Hands reach in and grab her, pulling her through the FLAMES...
          
          Seconds later Elena finds herself on the swamp floor, in Kristen's
          singed arms...
          
                                KRISTEN
                    You okay?
          
          Elena can barely talk, looking back at the flaming wreckage in
          front of her...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Care to explain?
          
                              ELENA
                    It was...it was an accident...
          
          The flames reflect in her tear-filled eyes.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie stands aghast at the sight of her diamonds, in a million
          tiny pieces on the museum's marble floor...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Fakes, I'm afraid. Made of glass. Can't
                    believe they were our top attraction all
                    these years...
          
          Every muscle in Marie's body contracts...She stands before the
          empty diamond exhibit case, runs her fingers over the portrait of
          her mother cradling her as a baby.
          
                              MARIE
                    That's my inheritance is it, Mom? Goddamn
                    Christmas ornaments...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   71.
          
          
          
          And as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from
          the case and tears it to shreds...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie, please...
          
          There's no stopping her now. Red-faced, she lashes out at the
          display case with a devastating kick, the glass SHATTERING...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie, stop this instant!
          
          She continues her rampage regardless, ripping a FIRE EXTINGUISHER
          from the wall and hurling it through another display case...
          
                              MARIE
                    I hate you, Mom!    I'm glad you're dead!
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY PD - NIGHT
          
          Storm clouds gather over the whitewashed Police station...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Elena sits with her head in her hands, across from Kristen in an
          anonymous interview room.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I told you.
          
          Elena looks up, tears streaking her mascara.
          
                              ELENA
                    Told me what?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That if you were telling the truth I'd
                    back you all the way. If you lied to me
                    there'd be trouble...
          
          Elena slumps back down, her head on the table.
          
                              ELENA
                    Chad swerved off the road, I swear...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Just swerved for no reason. Just decided
                    to take a shortcut through the swamp?
          
          Elena sobs, can't look Kristen in the eye.
          
                              ELENA
                    It was an accident...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   72.
          
          
          
          The door to the interview room swings open, and Detective Morrison
          strides through, a fresh-from-the-printer REPORT in his hands...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Accident my ass.
          
          He flips the pages of the report...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Forensics finds the head trauma that
                    killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a
                    single blow from behind.
          E
           lena looks up, through Panda eyes...
          
                              ELENA
                    The crash. He...he hit his head...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Was that before or after you dragged him
                    through the swamp?
          
          Elena has no answers as Morrison takes the cuffs from his belt,
          snaps them on Elena's wrists.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You got the right to remain silent, which
                    in your case is probably best, cos of the
                    shit you come up with...
          
          Kristen stands up, shaking her head.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That's two strikes, Elena. One more and
                    you're out.
          
          Elena looks at her pleadingly.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll do whatever you want.
          
          Kristen stops. Thinks for a moment. Nods to Morrison as he drags
          Elena to her feet.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Yeah. Yeah you will.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you
                    what happened. She killed him, and took
                    the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie
                    Clifford...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   73.
          
          
          
          Morrison just sneers.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Keep bleeting, Missy. All the way to the
                    Judge. I think its time he heard the
                    truth about Jay Clifford's accuser.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be
                    cleared, you know that. You need Marie,
                    you need the proof they set him up...
          
          Morrison considers this.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You came so close to nailing the Black
                    Widow, don't let this slip through your
                    fingers, Detective...
          
          He's about to speak, when Elena's cell phone rings. Kristen takes
          it from Elena, looks at the CALLER ID, sees Marie's name...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Speak of the Devil...
          
          She holds the phone up.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're gonna answer it. And you're gonna
                    say that everything went fine. No one
                    found Chad's body. The plan's still on.
                    Do you understand me?
          
          Elena nods slowly. Morrison turns to Kristen.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You thinking what I'm thinking?
          K
           risten's patient with him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    This is your chance. Feds can't take this
                    one from you...
          
          Morrison weighs his options, then finally nods.
          
          Kristen clicks the phone ON, holds it to Elena's ear.
          
                               ELENA
                    Yello...
          
                                                         03/22/2004   74.
          
          
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - NIGHT
          
          Marie speeds wildly down the deserted Blue Bay streets, one
          trembling hand holding a cigarette, the other her cellphone.
          
                               MARIE (ON PHONE)
                    The diamonds are fakes. Totally
                    worthless.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    No. That can't be true!
          
                              MARIE
                    Believe it. I'm leaving. Tonight.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    You can't...what about...me...
          
          Marie takes a long drag from her cigarette.
          
                              MARIE
                    Don't you understand? There's no money.
                    Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero. How am I
                    supposed to take care of your broke ass?
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kristen is listening in on the whole conversation. She cups her
          hand over the phone, whispers to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Tell her she has to meet you. Tell her
                    she can't leave...
          
          Elena nods and Kristen puts the phone back to her lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    I...I gotta see you.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    I'll send you a photo.
          
                              ELENA
                    Please. Just one last time.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    I'm gone, gone, gonski.
          
          Elena's reeling. Kristen motions for her to continue.
          
                              ELENA
                    I think maybe...maybe there's a way we
                    could still get some money...

          Silence on the end of the line...
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - NIGHT
          
          Marie considers this for a long moment.    Finally...
          
                              MARIE
                    Okay, talk...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    Not over the phone. We gotta meet.
          
                              MARIE

          Click. She's hung up. Kristen nods to Morrison...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Where'd you keep the wire taps?

                    Gimme the key.
          
          He tosses her his electronic keycard...

          The Blue Bay High pool is illuminated in the dead of night,
          casting blue ripples over the bleachers where Elena waits
          nervously. She can't help but fiddle with the wire hidden beneath
          her shirt...
          
                              ELENA
                        (whispering)
                    Can you hear me?
          
          INT. MORRISON'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Morrison listens nervously to Elena's tinny voice coming in
          through the speaker...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    Is this thing working?
          
          The Detective shoots Kristen a concerned look.
          
                              MORRISON
                    She's gonna blow it...

          Elena adjusts the mic taped to her chest, wincing as the tape
          pulls her delicate skin.
          
                              ELENA
                    I..don't think I can do this...
          
                              MARIE (O.S.)
                    It's already done.
          
          Elena looks up guiltily. Marie is standing by the side of the
          pool. How much did she see?
          
                              MARIE
                    So?
          
          The word's stick in Elena's throat...
          
                              ELENA
                    I had no choice...
          
                              MARIE
                    Blah, blah, blah. Get over it. He's dead.
                    Now you told me you had a plan. Spit it
                    out.
          
                              ELENA
                    Jay's got cash. At the building site. I
                    saw it.
          
          Marie rolls her eyes.
          
                              MARIE
                    That's your brilliant plan? It's in a
                    safe, dumb ass. You a safecracker? Have
                    you got magic fingers, gonna pick that
                    lock? I don't think so. Next.

                         (through the speakers)
                    We're gonna go to Jay. Tell him what we
                    did.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Like hell we are.

          Elena walks down the bleachers, approaching a skeptical Marie.
          
                              ELENA
                    Listen to me. We go to the jail, tell him
                    we'll come clean, tell the police
                    everything, if he gives us the
                    combination. I'm still a minor, they'll
                    send me back to Juvie. Shit, I could do
                    that time standing on my head...
          
          Marie's wavering.
          
                              MARIE
                    How much money?
          
          Elena reaches Marie, puts her hands on her hips.
          
                              ELENA
                    Enough for you and me.
          
          Grinds against her. Slowly, sensually.
          
                              MARIE
                    We don't have to tell the cops anything.
                    We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking.
          
                              ELENA
                    But, we got rid of the real one...
          
                              MARIE
                    I kept a copy. Never trusted you
                    backstabbers.
          
          Elena tries to pull away, but Marie drags her back until their
          faces are inches apart.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're trembling.
          
          There's no denying it. Marie slowly draws her hand down Elena's
          face, down her neck, to her chest. So close to the wire. Finally
          places her palm over Elena's heart...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie, I...

          Elena and Marie stand there for what seems like an eternity,

           OOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...
          
          Finally Marie smiles...

                    Alright. Let's do it...
          
          INT. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT
          
          Jay laughs, as he sits across from Marie and Elena, separated by
          an inch of bullet proof glass. Theo stands by the door.
          
                              JAY
                    Well, well, well. Who'd have thought.
                    What a pleasant surprise. I guess you
                    guys have kissed and made up?
          
                              MARIE
                    Very funny. Did you know the diamonds
                    were fakes?
          
          Jay nods slowly.
          
                              JAY
                    Your Mom hocked them years ago. Boozed it
                    all away. You already know the end of her
                    sorry story...
          
          Marie's jaw tightens. Jay leans back.
          
                              JAY
                    So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
          
                              MARIE
                    We want money. Whatever you've got in
                    your safe at the beach condos.
          
          Jay bursts out laughing again.
          
                              JAY
                    Of course you do. Of course you do.

                    We'll get you out of here...
          
          Jay stops laughing, leans back in to the inch thick glass.
          
                                 JAY
                    You will?
          
          Marie holds up a DIGITAL VIDEO TAPE...
          
                              JAY
                    Is that what I think it is?
          
                              MARIE
                    You give us the combination and this goes
                    in the nearest mail box, tied with a
                    pretty pink bow.
          
                              JAY
                    How do I know it's the real tape?
          
                              MARIE
                    You're gonna have to trust us.
          
                              JAY
                    I've been down that road before.
          
          Marie opens the cassette housing, ready to rip the tape apart...
          
                              MARIE
                    This is non-negotiable.
          
          Theo interjects...
          
                              THEO
                    Sir, we have no grounds for appeal. This
                    could be our only chance.
          
                              MARIE
                    What's the combination?
          
          The tortured screams of inmates echo in Jay's ears.
          
                                 JAY
                    I can't...
          
                              MARIE
                    No such word as 'can't'...
          
          A PRISON GUARD puts a massive hand on Jay's shoulder...

          Marie handles the car like a Formula One driver, and with twice
          the intensity. The G-force pins Elena back against the seat.

                    Slow down!
          
          Marie steps on the gas.

                    We're in a world of shit!
          
          Marie steps on the gas.

                    We'll never get away with this. You know
                    that don't you?
          
          Marie steps on the gas. She ain't saying a word, and time's
          running out for Elena...
          
          INT. MORRISON'S POLICE CAR - NIGHT
          
          Morrison struggles to keep up with Marie's Bullit-esque driving.
          Kristen stays focused on the one-sided conversation in her
          headphones...
          
                              KRISTEN

          Marie's BMW screeches to a stop outside the beachfront condos, and
          Marie strides towards the construction site entrance.
          
          Elena gets out the car, feeling decidedly sick. She circuitously
          adjusts the microphone taped to her chest, then follows Marie into
          the dark, unfinished building
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Marie enters the makeshift office like a wolf stalking her prey,
          heading straight for the safe. With a rock steady hand, she works
          the lock...CLICK...
          
                              MARIE

                        (over headphones)
                    Marie! Please, I can't do this...
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Marie's working the safe combination like a master thief, spinning
          it nimbly between her buffed nails. CLICK...
          
                                MARIE
                    Two down.
          
          Elena stands in the makeshift office doorway, trying to coax
          something incriminating from Marie's perfect lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    I told you not to kill Chad. I'll tell it
                    to the police.
          
          Marie doesn't even look round, concentrating on the job at hand.
          Elena's reeling.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   82.

                    stepfather raping me, made me perjure
                    myself on the stand, went and killed
                    Chad, and now...

                    99. A very good year...
          
          CLICK. Third and final tumbler falls. The safe door swings open,
          revealing a STACK of CASH and Jay's HANDGUN...
          
          INT. MORRISON'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kristen shakes her head. It's hopeless, Elena can't get Marie to
          say an incriminating word...
          
                              MORRISON
                    This has gotta end.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It's gonna end. One way or another...
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Marie pulls out a wad of crisp, clean bills, draws them across her
          nose like a wine connoisseur.
          
                              MARIE
                    Money. Always in style.
          
          She dances over to Elena, waves the cash in her face.
          
                              ELENA
                    Why'd you do it? Why'd Chad have to die?
          
          Marie slides up against Elena, fluttering the cash over her in the
          world's most expensive shower. Elena couldn't be less interested,
          focused on getting that confession...
          
                              ELENA
                    You killed him, Marie. You murdered him
                    in cold blood...
          
          Marie presses up against Elena, pushing her up against the
          unfinished dry wall. Kisses her passionately, finally silencing
          her for a few, brief, electric seconds. And when she pulls away
          her fingers dance down Elena's shirt until...

           he rips the microphone from Elena's chest. Stands there with the
          dangling cord in her hands, her face caught in a permanent snarl.
          The blood drains from Elena's face...

          A piercing feedback forces Kristen to throw aside the headphones.
          She looks to Morrison.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    She's been made...
          
          Morrison draws his gun.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Stay here...
          
          Kristen shakes her head resolutely.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I got us into this...
          
          BANG! A GUNSHOT echoes in the darkness...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Just stay in the car! Please...
          
          Morrison sprints over to the building site, leaving Kristen in the
          car, alone.

          Elena stands with her hands up, an ugly bullet hole in the wall
          just beside her. Marie keeps Jay's gun trained on her as she
          unloads the cash from the safe...
          
                              MARIE
                    You stupid fucking Sherbert. You think
                    you could sell me out?

          Marie takes dead aim once more...

          BOOM!
          
          Kristen tenses as the gunshot echoes throughout the construction
          site. She reaches across to the driver's seat, grabs the
          SHOTGUN...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elena scrambles across the concrete floor, desperately trying to
          make it to the relative safety of one of the support pillars. She
          sees the forensic UV light switch on the floor, reaches for it...
          
          MARIE
          
          stands in the shattered doorway, surveys the expansive, unfinished
          floor. Is about to unleash a hail of bullets when...
          
          The WORK LIGHTS flicker out, replaced by the eerie ULTRA VIOLET
          LIGHTS scattered around the unfinished floor...Bathed in the
          florescent blue glow of the lights, Elena scrambles to safety
          behind a pillar. Her shirt GLOWS, her eyes like beacons...
          
          MORRISON                                                             
          Sweeps through the second floor, meticulously checking every         
          corner, every shadow...

          Runs towards the unfinished building, looking up to the UV glow on 
          the fourth floor. She sprints for the INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR...       
          MARIE
          
          scours the bizarre darkness, hears a sound. BOOM! The orange
          muzzle flash illuminates the floor briefly as Marie shoots
          randomly. The flimsy plaster walls EXPLODE...
          
          MORRISON                                                             
          Enters the third floor from the fire escape, continues his           
          meticulous sweep of the building.

          Stands in the industrial elevator, jabbing the 4th floor button,  
          hyperventilating as more gunshots EXPLODE. She clutches Morrison's 
          shotgun to her chest, getting closer to the top floor.             
          ELENA
          
          shields herself as plaster rains down on her, unable to see
          through the cloud of dust under the UV lights, until...

          BOOM! A bullet sparks off rebar inches from her foot. She looks up
          to see the barrel of Jay's gun. Marie's face is contorted
          maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger...                  
          MORRISON
          
          Runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening GUN SHOT
          rings out. Followed by SCREAMS. He rips open the fourth floor fire 
          door, tearing through the building, pushing through thick plastic
          sheeting until he finds himself under the UV glow.
          T
           hick plumes of blood, black under the UV light, stain the walls
          and floor. He sees Elena, in a fetal ball, trembling
          uncontrollably.
          
          Beside her, Marie lies dead, her chest a gaping crimson mess,
          Jay's gun still clutched tightly in her cold, dead hands.
          
          Kristen looks up at him, almost too shocked to speak.   Morrison's
          shotgun is still smoking in her hands.
          
                               KRISTEN
                     I didn't have a choice. She was gonna
                     kill Elena.
          
          Morrison steps forward, calmly, takes the gun from her.
          
                               MORRISON
                     It's gonna be okay.
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - LATER
          
          The new crime scene is alive with activity. Cops, reporters,
          bystanders. Morrison sips coffee as PARAMEDICS wheel Marie's
          corpse to the ambulance.
          
          One of them hands something to Morrison. A blood-splattered
          digital video tape.
          
                               PARAMEDIC
                     We found this on the body.
          
          Morrison takes it without a word...
          
                               KRISTEN (O.S.)
                     Just got off the phone with the Parole
                     board...
          
          Morrison turns around, sees Kristen approaching, still visibly
          shaken.

                    in the morning.
          
          She hesitates...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I'm... sorry for this whole mess.
          
          Morrison considers this, picks his words carefully.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Don't be. It was my gun that fired the
                    shots, so it must've been me who pulled
                    the trigger. I'll take the credit on this
                    one. After all the Black widow crap I had
                    to put up with, I've earnt it...
          
          Kristen nods.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You did the right thing...

                    We did the right thing.
          
           risten smiles, almost, moves in, and wraps her arms around the
          Detective. He closes his eyes, savors the moment. As she pulls
          away, she hands him a card.

                    I will. I will.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Now that this is all over, maybe we can
                    have that drink soon...
          
          She leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips. Morrison watches her
          walk away. In spite of all the shit that's gone down, he's
          probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of Blue Bay.

          EXT. COUNTY JAIL - MORNING
          
          Morrison's unmarked Sedan idles outside the barbed wire fences of
          the County Jail. The gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed Jay
          Clifford outside, wincing from the bright sunlight.

          Morrison gets out of the car, meets Jay.

                      How you holdin' up, Jay?

                      So what's next?
          
                                JAY
                      No idea. Everything's gone. Repossessed.
                      Guess there's nowhere to go but up.
          
          It's all he can do to keep from breaking down.
          
                                MORRISON
                      I can't help but feel partially
                      responsible. If there's anything I...
          
          Jay shakes his head.
          
                                JAY
                      I don't think so, but thanks.
          
                                MORRISON
                      Can I at least give you a ride somewhere?
          
                                JAY
                      Ain't got nowhere to go...
          
          Morrison watches sadly as Jay stumbles past him, walking to
          nowhere in particular.
          
                                MORRISON
                          (hopeful)
                      ... but up, right?
          
          No reply.
          
          The Detective heads back to his car, stops for a second, reaches
          into his pocket and pulls out Kristen's already-dog eared card. He
          can't resist. Dials the number After four rings there's no
          message. Just a BEEP.
          
                                MORRISON
                          (into phone)
                      Uh, Kristen, it's Michael again. Haven't
                      heard from you. Hope you're doing okay.
                      Everything's fine here.

                              MORRISON(CONT'D)
                    Haven't been any questions asked that I
                    can't answer, an' no one's brought your
                    name up. So give me a call back and maybe
                    we can go for that drink...

           e's cut off by...
          
                              RECORDED VOICE
                    BEEP. The mail box you are trying to
                    reach is full. Your message has been
                    deleted.
          
          Morrison's disconnected. Puzzled, he gets into his car.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD - DAY
          
          Morrison gets the shock of his life when he enters the usually
          quiet police station and finds himself in the midst of utter
          pandemonium.
          
          Federal Officers are everywhere.
          
          He tries to pick his way through the crowd when he's intercepted
          by Officer Entwistle.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    You better come with me, Detective.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD - MORRISON'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Entwistle leads Morrison into his office, where Agent Dammers sits
          behind his desk.
          
                              AGENT DAMMERS
                    Detective Morrison. So good to finally
                    see you.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What the hell, Dammers?
          
                              AGENT DAMMERS
                    I should be asking you the same question.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
          
          Morrison stands in the middle of the evidence locker, dumbfounded.
          Dammers watches him, his arms crossed.
          
                              MORRISON
                    It's...gone.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    That's right, Morrison. Every last bit of
                    evidence from the Black Widow case.
          
                                                               03/22/2004   89.
                              DAMMERS(CONT'D)
                    Not to mention the money you confiscated.
                    All $427,000.                                                 
                                 MORRISON
                    But how...
          
                              DAMMERS
                    I was hoping you'd be able to answer that
                    question.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What in God's name are you talking about?
                    I didn't have anything to do with it!
          
                              DAMMERS
                    Well, your key card was the last one that
                    opened this locker.
          
          Morrison's heart is beating a mile a minute.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Holy shit. Kristen...
          
          INT. DADE COUNTY PAROLE OFFICE - DAY
          
          A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST sits behind a sparse desk when the phone
          rings.
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST

          INT. BLUE BAY PD EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
          
          Morrison paces back and forth, on the phone, as Dammers watches,
          not saying a word...
          
                              MORRISON
                        (into phone)
                    This is Detective Morrison, Blue Bay PD.
                    I was wondering if you had a forwarding
                    number for Kristen Richards...
          
                                 PRETTY RECEPTIONIST(V.O.)
                    Who?
          
                              MORRISON
                    Kristen Richards. She's one of your
                    officers. Has cases up here in Blue Bay.
          
          INT. DADE COUNTY PAROLE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The receptionist's fingers nimbly dance across the keyboard in
          front of her.
          
                                                                       90.
          
          
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
                    I'm sorry, Detective. There's no one here
                    by that name.
          
                              MORRISON
                    No, of course there is. I worked with her
                    personally. I...
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
                    I have no record of a Kristen Richards
                    ever working here. Besides, Blue Bay's
                    out of our jurisdiction...
          
          INT. EVIDENCE LOCKER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Morrison struggles to control his emotions...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Oh no. No, no, no...
          
          EXT. PARADISE - DAY
          
          Soft waves lap against a pristine beach. Palm trees sway in the
          warm breeze. A steady WHIRRING is the only sound that disturbs the
          serenity. Is it a lawn mower? A leaf blower?
          
          There's a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this
          idyllic scene. The swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical
          Caribbean Sunlight.
          
          And stretched out on a recliner in the sheerest of bikinis is none
          other than Kristen Richards, soaking up rays.
          
          At her side is a PAPER SHREDDER, and between sips from a piña
          colada, she feeds document after document, each one stamped BLACK
          WIDOW EVIDENCE in red ink...
          
          Kristen looks over at Elena, equally stunning in a matching
          bikini.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I can't believe Morrison just handed me
                    the key to the evidence locker...
          
          A broad grin stretches across her lips as Elena empties the
          contents of a velvet pouch onto a table.
          T
           he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    These are...genuine?
          
          Elena nods.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   91.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Nothin' like the real thing. Switched
                    'em for the fakes right after Marie tried
                    to pay me off...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    They're...So beautiful.
          
          Elena picks up the bigger diamond, hands it to Kristen.
          
                              ELENA
                    The mother.
          
          Kristen picks up the smaller diamond, hands it to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    The daughter.
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY
          
          Morrison paces the infamous crime scene, at wit's end. Dammers
          stands off to the side, just watching him with a bemused look
          etched across his face.
          
                              MORRISON
                    She was the Black Widow. Her and that
                    little...
          
          He tries to think of an appropriate slur for Elena. Can't come up
          with anything, continues pacing frantically.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Played me like a fool.
          
          Dammers shrugs.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    Hind sight's 20-20. No need to be so hard
                    on yourself, Morrison...
                        (beat, smile)
                    That's my job.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You smug son of a bitch. It's not like
                    you knew who she was anymore than I did.
          
          Dammers nods slowly.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    That's the God's honest truth. But at
                    least I didn't give her my evidence
                    locker keycard.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   92.
                              DAMMERS(CONT'D)
                    And I didn't lie about who fired the
                    shots that killed the Clifford kid.
          
          Morrison's heart sinks. He looks like he's going to faint.
          Steadies himself, placing both hands against the wall, just as Jay
          did that fateful night seemingly a lifetime ago...
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY
          
          Dammers leads Morrison to his awaiting car. They pass MR. Barajas
          and Cicatriz. Mr. Barajas is in his usual foul mood...
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    Un pinche sink hole! No lo puedo creer!
          
          Morrison stops, regards Barajas...
          
                              MORRISON
                    What did you say?
          
                               CICATRIZ
                    The foundation is sinking. The entire
                    site is a sink hole. It's completely
                    worthless.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    I'm going to kill Jay Clifford...
          
                              MORRISON
                    You and me both...
          
          EXT. PARADISE - DAY
          
          Elena and Kristen lay side-by-side on loungers, soaking in the
          sun, when a voice rouses them...
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    Poor Detective Morrison. It's hard to do
                    that to a friend. Especially one going
                    through such a nasty divorce.
          
          They look up to see Jay, standing before them in a pair of
          colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini...
          
                              JAY
                    Told me he'd never trust another woman as
                    long as he lived. And then along came a
                    spider...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    A black widow.
          
          Jay glances at Elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink.
          
                                                         03/22/2004   93.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                                                                               
                    More like widows... Gotta say I was a
                    little taken aback when you wanted to                      
                    snuff Marie, but you know what, I'm over                   
                                                                               
                    the bitch...
          
          Elena suddenly gets to her feet.
          
                              ELENA
                    You want me to top you off?
          
                              JAY
                    That'd be fine, just fine.
          
          He hands Elena his empty glass, then kisses Kristen tenderly.
          When they break...
          
                              JAY
                    She's got a good head on her shoulders.
          
          Kristen doesn't reply. Just smiles, watches Elena over by the
          outside bar, mixing Jay's drink...
          
                              JAY
                    You two got me out of a mountain of shit,
                    I'll tell you that. Craziest Goddamn
                    scheme I've ever heard of. But hell, you
                    played it perfectly.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    My job was easy. It was Elena who had to
                    keep it all together...
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    We've had some practice along the way...
          
          Jay turns around, smiles at Elena as she holds out his drink.
          
                              ELENA
                    Here you go, Mr. Clifford.
          
          Jay takes it from her appreciatively, sips at it as he sidles off
          to the swimming pool.
          
                              JAY
                    Well, all that nasty business, it's
                    behind us. Forever. From here on out,
                    it's the good life.
          
          He starts to climb the high dive. When he gets to the top, he
          looks down at Elena and Kristen, smiles.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   94.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    You two look so good, it's difficult to
                    tell which one's the mother and which
                    one's the daughter...
          
          Kristen calls back up at him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That's just the roofies talking...
          
          Says it so sweetly, it takes a moment for Jay to register the
          sinister implications...
          
                              JAY
                    What did you say?
          
          His eyes are blood shot. He starts to sway atop the high dive.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Delta Chi, class of '88. Hellova party.
                    I'd never really tasted cocktails like
                    that.
          
          Jay's swaying uneasily on the high dive platform...
          
                              JAY
                    I don't...whattya talking about?
          
                               KRISTEN
                    It was like being awake though an
                    operation. I could feel everything
                    happening, but I couldn't do anything to
                    stop it...
          
                              JAY
                    Oh...shit...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You took something from me that night.
                    But you left something behind...
          
          Jay's head is spinning as he looks to Kristen, to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Your daughter...
          
          He can't quite get his mind around it. Everything's becoming
          blurry.
          
                              JAY
                    I don't remember...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   95.
          
          
          
          He looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before
          it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below,
          shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds...
          E
           lena and Kristen stand side-by-side below him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You may not remember...
          
          A broad grin stretches across Elena's lips as she finishes...
          
                              ELENA
                    ...But you'll never forget.
          
          Jay tries to take a step forward. He stumbles. Tries in vain to
          regain his balance. It's too late. He falls. 20 feet to the
          unyielding concrete, exploding like a paper bag filled with
          vegetable soup...
          
                              ELENA
                    Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing.
          
          They stand back, watching Jay's pancaked body draining its
          precious blood into the ice blue pool...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Let's go get our money.
          
          They gather the diamonds, walk away as the pool turns crimson
          red...
          
          THE END
          
          As the credits roll....
          
          INT. OFFICE - MORNING
          
          An anonymous, luxurious office. A fat, balding, semi-conscious MAN
          lies curled up on the floor as Elena, half undressed and wearing a
          black wig, shovels cash into her oversized purse...
          
          There's a crackle on her WALKIE-TALKIE...
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    We got problems...
          
          From outside, she can hear the wailing of SIRENS. Getting closer.
          
                              ELENA
                    Almost done here.
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    Leave it. Come on!
          
                                                                       96.
          
          
          
          Elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her
          pocket for good measure.
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    He gonna be able to make an ID?
          
          Elena glances at the Man on the floor, his puffy eyes glazed over
          like a jelly donut.
          
                              ELENA
                    Not on your life. I gave him enough
                    roofies to make an elephant forget.
          
          EXT. OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Elena gets into a waiting car outside the bank. The getaway
          driver...Kristen, of course...
          
                              ELENA
                    I can't believe we just gave up all that
                    cash.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Forget it. The Black Widow's finally got                   
                    an angle on our real prey.  
                                         
                              ELENA                                            
                    We goin' to Blue Bay?  
                                              
                              KRISTEN                                          
                    He won't know what hit him.       
                                   
          A smile crosses Elena's perfect lips...    
                                    
                              ELENA                                            
                    'bout time...        
                                                
          And the car pulls away from the curb just seconds before a fleet
          of police cars screeches to a halt in front of the bank.
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - JAY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Jay carefully places the stacks of cash into the wall safe in his
          unfinished office.
          
                              KRISTEN (O.S.)
                    That's an awful lot of money...
          
          Jay spins round, flabbergasted that someone's watching him.
          
                              JAY
                    Who the hell...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   97.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Not enough though. Gonna need those
                    Diamonds if you're gonna ride out this
                    disaster...
          
                              JAY
                    What? What the hell do you mean?
          
          Kristen calmly reaches into her purse, pulls out a handful of
          marbles. Throws them onto the ground, letting them roll towards
          B
          Jay...
          
           ut they stop, change direction, all coming rolling back in a
          small circle, until they come to rest in the middle of the
          concrete floor...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    The building's built on a sink hole, Jay.
                    You know it, and I know it. Gonna need to
                    think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans
                    off your back...
          
          Jay's tiny mind can't take it all in.
          
                              JAY
                    How'd you...how'd you know all this...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It's what we do.
          
                              JAY
                    We?
          
          Elena walks seductively into the unfinished office. It's on.
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
          
          Marie sits in the bleachers by the side of the school dive pool,
          looking at her Mother's soon-to-be-diamond ring through teary
          eyes...
          
                              MARIE
                    I just want what's mine...
          
          Elena stalks the bleachers behind her.
          
                              ELENA
                    The diamonds are your inheritance. You
                    deserve them...
          
                              MARIE
                    My fucking Step-Monster'll never give me
                    the Goddamn key...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   98.
          
          
          
          Elena jumps down the bleachers, sits down next to Marie.
          
                              ELENA
                    So you take it, one way or another...
          
          INT. CHAD'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Behind closed doors, Chad's completing yet another dubious
          transaction, handing over a bag of roofies. The buyer this
          time...Marie...
          
                              MARIE
                    You take a check?
          
                              CHAD
                    Money talks, bullshit walks. I got
                    strippers to feed...
          
          Marie fishes out the money from her purse.
          
                              MARIE
                    How'd you like to make some real cash?
          
                              CHAD
                    Chad likes the sound of that.
          
          And it's that simple...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Chad uses Jay's teeth mouldings to bite Elena, as Marie trains
          Jay's video camera on her, wailing on her in a drunken stupor.
          
                              ELENA
                    Hey, that hurt!
          
                              MARIE
                    Shut it, bitch. No pain, no gain...
          
          Elena's face is pressed against the concrete wall...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT
          
          Chad sits at his video console, all alone, expertly manipulating
          the audio and video footage.
          
                              CHAD
                    We'll put you right here, and...
          
          Chad presses play. On the video screen a frightened Elena is
          huddled against the wall.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   99.
          
          
          
                              JAY (V.O.)
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Elena watches as Marie and Theo drive away, then turns to the
          glistening Mother Daughter diamonds. She opens a case with two
          identical GLASS REPLICAS, and replaces the diamonds...
          
          All the while, Uncle Marty SNORES his head off...
          
                              ELENA
                        (to Uncle Marty, irritated)
                    Will you knock that off? They're gone.
          
          Uncle Marty's eyes snap open.
          
          EXT. BEACH PARADISE - DAY
          
          Kristen and Marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach
          when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their
          sizzling bodies.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're blocking our sun...
          
          Looks over her sunglasses at...Uncle Marty...Only all cleaned up,
          in a pair of Bermuda shorts that show off his milky white legs...
          He clutches a briefcase...
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Ladies. Hellova job back there. Your best
                    ever if I might be so bold...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    This is our biggest score. You sure you
                    can move it?
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Not a problem.
          
          Kristen nods to the briefcase in Uncle Marty's hand.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Let's see the green...
          
          Uncle Marty lays the case down on the lounger, opens it, revealing
          stacks of cash...
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Got another lead, if you're interested.
                    Was just up in Boston, surveying a
                    mansion that's just been sold.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   100.
                                 UNCLE MARTY(CONT'D)
                       Termites already eaten most of it.
                       Owner's shitting bricks. There's gotta be
                       an angle for the Black Widows...
          
          Kristen and Elena look to each other.
          
                                 KRISTEN
                       It's over. We had a good run.
          
          Uncle Marty shrugs.
          
                                 UNCLE MARTY
                       Shame. Guess all good things come to an
                       end. So, the diamonds...
          
          Elena reaches down, pulls the diamonds from the sand. Hands them
          over and is about to take the case of money when...
          
                                 UNCLE MARTY
                       How do I know these are the real thing?
          
          Elena looks to Kristen. They smile.
          
                                 ELENA
                       You're going to have to trust us...
          
          Like fuck.
          
          THE END. AGAIN.
